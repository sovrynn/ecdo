# Date and Triggers

This folder is for predicting the date of the impending ECDO, along with potential triggers for it.

## Timeframe Speculation

Possible destabilization began around 1973 (Reference Ethical Skeptic thesis).

Nobulart prediction: Worst case S1 -> S2 as early as mid-2030, with S2 -> S1 in 2042/3.

## TODO Possible Triggers

- galactic current sheet
- micronova
- planetary alignment
- periodic comet
- Earth simply letting go

## Ben Davidson

Seems to have done some work useful for predicting the ECDO timeframe. See `LITERATURE/ben-davidson`.

The steady narrowing of real polar nutation [1] in apparent lockstep with the approaching Landscheidt Minimum [2] in June 2030, and near pass by 2P/Encke in June 2030 [3] whilst we are at solar grand minimum[4]. AgeEnder 2030 courtesy of the Saturnalian maniacs behind it. As a sidenote: When the 360-365 day calendar adjustment around 687BC is accounted for, the Mayan long-count does not resolve to 2012, but to around 2030-2040 depending on when one determines the calendar adjustment occurred.

## Nobulart

I think there is certainly enough energy involved between the sun and the earth for a field inversion in the sun during a gravitational lull to be the trigger for the decoupling. As we progress towards  the slip the progression must manifest as accelerated magnetic polar wander and a narrowing of average real polar nutation (due to the drift occurring between core and mantle). The heat is rising and water is an excellent medium to draw it out.

I think the Sun's regular field inversion during a grand solar minimum may be the trigger for a micronova.

## Gas giant harmonic (June 2030)

See `ADHOC-EVIDENCE/solar-system` for details.

An important date in this data is June 2030.

## Encke Comet (June 2030)

There will be a historically close pass with Encke in June 2030. Â±40 million km.
