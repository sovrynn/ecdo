- `recent-natural-disasters`: Tracking natural disasters which may have an uptick because of the ECDO.

Speculative contents:

## Information that belongs elsewhere

Speculation on how long S1 -> S2 will take belongs in `FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/s1-to-s2/duration`.

Speculation on how frequent the ECDO is belongs in `FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/ecdo-frequency`.

Evidence on past ECDO events belongs in `ADHOC-EVIDENCE`.

## TODO

- investigate additional data feeds related to the ECDO such as temperature
