# Monitoring the Present Rotation

This folder aims to be as accurate of a progress indicator as possible on the current impending rotation.

Helpful info may include:
- estimating how soon it could happen, how long it would last, phases of the rotation
- monitoring natural disasters
- useful data feeds such as temperature, wandering of the rotational axis
- how often it has happened

Evidence on past ECDO events belongs not here, but in `2-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`.
