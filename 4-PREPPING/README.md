# Prepping for an ECDO event

This directory is for all things prepping. Location, safety, resources, shelter, community.

## Nobulart Recommendations

Stay away from any built up structures (ie towns) and look for high open ground (like a hilltop) which also provides solid shelter on the SW side of the summit. The wind could theoretically be coming from the NE as the rotation unfolds, but strength would vary. Once the rotatino completes, the ocean will return from the SW, probably some 12-24 hours after the initial revolution. This is the first seiche, and it may well inundate several hundred kilometers inland. There would be several more of these over the next weeks as the oceans continue to settle.

Locations 2000m-2500m above sea level, above bedrock
