# Prepping for an ECDO event

This directory is for all things prepping. Location, safety, resources, shelter, community.

*"Estimating how much time we might have is as high a priority (if not higher) than safety mapping. Possibly even higher on the list is ensuring that what we learn isn’t lost and survives the event."* [1]

## Safe Locations [1]

Stay away from any built up structures (ie towns) and look for high open ground (like a hilltop) which also provides solid shelter on the SW side of the summit. The wind could theoretically be coming from the NE as the rotation unfolds, but strength would vary. Once the rotatino completes, the ocean will return from the SW, probably some 12-24 hours after the initial revolution. This is the first seiche, and it may well inundate several hundred kilometers inland. There would be several more of these over the next weeks as the oceans continue to settle.

Locations 2000m-2500m above sea level, above bedrock

## Data Storage

With the weakening magnetic field, could technology be fried in the near future?

*"This is the main issue with information storage and retrieval through one of these events. Previous solutions involved building vast megalithic structures with engraved stone to overcome this hurdle."* [1]

## Permaculture Farm

... Setup and develop a farm since 2012 to become as sustainable and self-sufficient as possible using permaculture principles. Basic premise is to have up to 1960s technology level ie. mechanically injected diesel tractor needing no electricity and all the systems viable without electricity on the farm, there are some electricity generation via solar and wind, storage with NiFe and Li batteries for lights and such but no dependency from them on survival.

One of the recently published very valuable books on the permaculture area is Regenerative Agriculture by Richard Perkins https://www.regenerativeagriculturebook.com

Also recently read a book from Lewis Dartnell - How to rebuild civilization in the aftermath of a cataclysm Theoretical model it starts with is a global pandemic depopulating earth and leaving most of the resources in place for the surviving population, but even on this level of civilization reset the recovery is extremely compicated and opens up the reality how extremely intertwined the modern world is. https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Knowledge-Rebuild-Civilization-Aftermath-Cataclysm/dp/0143127047/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GADSQP304AE3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Qk7x3R8Dv-RtJ3JpeBJH-Vy4wZRysW0N5HNmJY2aL2kr5u4K3P_v41mcXgNerh7e7LeXmnrxdl4HHL7bip4Mvkw3IACNh7KwvnE4_s2gNtYB-IY9BhPUrFa8n6coHt9v64krMKID5cTdXJ-TaqSzHwxI4BukWR8fVmLa0hHu8h5U2ZbNFsbFAJmlwVmF8E6OuyDuTLwkr58TFQadPvgZF07K-WyBjzlC09xP9XwOiCs.ApWNQtNF6M67Dz-NBNObIMAuEVT66p4DU2L4m0qB3ik&dib_tag=se&keywords=how+to+rebuild+civilization+the+book&qid=1728923427&sprefix=how+to+rebuild+c%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1

That is close, but I don’t think close enough. Somewhere in this group of islands.
