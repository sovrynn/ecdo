## Lunar-based Asteroid Impact Mitigation System

"..an innovative and scalable solution to address one of the greatest natural threats to humanity, using the Moon as a strategic platform for planetary defense." If we can land on asteroids then we should be able to alter their trajectories. I asked GPT to take a shot at visualizing the concept of a lunar-based asteroid impact mitigation system (L-BAIMS). Thousands of these could be stationed in a launch-ready state on the far side of the moon. A summary of the concept is included in the transcript.
