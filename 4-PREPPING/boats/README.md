### India

That's a 1/5 scaled down version of the original tablet dimensions. Made in India. Based on a coracle design. 

It didn't float. And the base had to be supported downwards with struts, so it wouldn't push up centrally & sink in on itself.

A viable version would probably require quite a lot of engineering.

Whether the original prescription of palm herd rope, wood support structures & bitumen waterproofing is enough is TBC.
