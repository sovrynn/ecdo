# Asia

A massive continent that is home to the east ECDO pivot at Sulawesi, Indonesia. It also has one of the largest areas of highest elevation, in west China north of India. Rushing into the Pacific in S1 -> S2. it will undoubtedly experience a massive water surge.

Asia will rotate clockwise, following the length of the red and yellow lines.

# Analysis

## Oceanic Displacement

The oceanic displacement for Asia, particularly east Asia, begins with its land and shallow tranches of ocean bordering the deep Pacific Ocean. Here's how I see the macro ocean chokepoints and flow:

The Pacific Ocean, ranging from 4-6km deep, is going to get displaced onto a coastline ranging from -2000m to 0m in height. Depending on the rotation speed and the chokepoint topography, you could see very high water surges.

## Tectonic Plates

Asia has one of the most fractured tectonic plate regions in the world.
