# Himalayas (Tibet)

Potential to get inundated from the east. It's the large chunk of high-elevation land in the southwest of China.

Nobulart prediction: "Tibet will be inundated for sure."

The mighty Himalayas. They get their feet wet on the southern slopes during S2>S1. I think maybe not Uttarakhand.

## Tibet flood myth

See `EVIDENCE/cataclysm-stories/asia`. In *Worlds in Collision*, Velikovsky cites a source saying that Tibet was inundated.

## Salt lakes in Tibet

*"In ancient times, before the collision of tectonic plates originated the Himalayas, the Tibetan plateau was covered by a great sea. The many salty lakes that remain were the main deposits of such a precious commodity for Tibetans."*

Not looking good for Tibet...
