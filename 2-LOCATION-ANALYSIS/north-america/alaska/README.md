Relative velocity is determined at any given point by its distance from the nearest pivot. Alaska, eastern Siberia and the Bering Strait (where all these frozen beasties were found), lie pretty much dead center between the pivots, at the maximum possible distance from them, where the highest wind and water velocities would be experienced.

For a 12 hour rotation, this would imply a relative median velocity of over 900km/h along the ECDO path through the Bering Strait. (104 degrees / 360 degrees x 40000 km / 12 hours = 962.9). Add to this that this region moves into the oncoming west-east movement of the Pacific, and even with a 12 hour rotation supersonic wind speeds are perfectly within the realm of possibility.
