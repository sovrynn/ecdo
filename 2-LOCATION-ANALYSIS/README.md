## Basic Contribution Guidelines

When investigating specific locations, include a map marking the location relative to its surrounding landmass. See Oranjemund (`LOCATION-ANALYSIS/africa/south-africa/oranjemund`) and Svalbard (`LOCATION-ANALYSIS/arctic/svalbard`) as examples.

## Chokepoints

North Sea chokepoints, north to south: The Norwegian Trench, the Devil's holes, the Holderness coastline, the Jurassic coastline, ripples across France, the creation of the Alps, Pyrennes and the Iberian peninsula, the huge oceanic trenches to the south of UK and Ireland.

## TODO Nobulart quote

Nevada and Utah are classic examples of huge flood morphology. We found current ripples in Somalia which gave a calculated water depth of 1.2km, probably the Mediterranean. Observed water levels in many places appear to be in agreement with theorized movement of water. The ripples I’ve seen in France, USA, South America and Australia suggest water MUCH deeper than Somalia. Definitely 3-4km and more in places.

## oldest remnants

Until a few years ago, the oldest known figurative cave painting was a 21,000-year-old rock art panel in Lascaux, France, showing a bird-headed human charging a bison.

Previously, the earliest evidence of a therianthrope was the 40,000-year-old 'Lion Man' sculpture unearthed in a cave in Germany.

## Countour maps

## TODO heuristics for evaluating locations

Additional potential heuristics:
- land elevation, flood height
- oldest cities, longest inhabitation
- protection from wind
- temperature
- proximity to fault lines
- Longest standing tall structures, old relics/remains
	- For example, it's hard to imagine that a theoretical archaelogical site where tools and intact structures were found could have been flooded by a huge wall of water without getting destroyed or at least scattered somehow.
- every sufficiently ethnically unique human tribe must have survived an ECDO event, because otherwise they would have had to develop their racial uniqueness within single ECDO epochs. Maybe you could model a "minimum degrees of separation", based on how much time it would take to create genetic uniqueness, to figure out the minimum genetic distance at which you could say that two different gene pools must have survived ECDO events separately
