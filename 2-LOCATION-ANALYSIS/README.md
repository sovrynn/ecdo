*"I've been looking at biblical and old English history recently and it's clear the middle East becomes a cradle of civilisation after the event surrounded by inaccessible "Wilderness". Around the time of Christ there is then a migration of Israelites round the southern Med and up through Spain to the UK. I suspect this was because it was the only habitable route up to the UK whilst continental Europe was still a waste land. But if you look at where great civilisations re-emerged it was the middle East, India and China. Roraima and Sulawesi remain isolated backwaters to this day."*

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

When investigating specific locations, include a map marking the location relative to its surrounding landmass. See Oranjemund (`LOCATION-ANALYSIS/africa/south-africa/oranjemund`) and Svalbard (`LOCATION-ANALYSIS/arctic/svalbard`) as examples.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization

Scholars generally acknowledge seven cradles of civilization: Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, and Iran are believed to be the earliest in Afro-Eurasia (previously called the Old World);[6][7][8] while in the Americas (previously called the New World), the Caral–Supe civilization of ancient Peru is believed to be the earliest in South America and the Olmec civilization of ancient Mexico is believed to be the earliest in North America.

## TODO Nobulart quote

Nevada and Utah are classic examples of huge flood morphology. We found current ripples in Somalia which gave a calculated water depth of 1.2km, probably the Mediterranean. Observed water levels in many places appear to be in agreement with theorized movement of water. The ripples I’ve seen in France, USA, South America and Australia suggest water MUCH deeper than Somalia. Definitely 3-4km and more in places.

## Chokepoints

North Sea chokepoints, north to south: The Norwegian Trench, the Devil's holes, the Holderness coastline, the Jurassic coastline, the creation of the Alps, the huge oceanic trenches to the south of UK and Ireland.

## Oldest cave art remnants

Until a few years ago, the oldest known figurative cave painting was a 21,000-year-old rock art panel in Lascaux, France, showing a bird-headed human charging a bison.

Previously, the earliest evidence of a therianthrope was the 40,000-year-old 'Lion Man' sculpture unearthed in a cave in Germany.

## TODO heuristics for evaluating locations

Additional potential heuristics:
- oldest cities, longest inhabitation, longest standing tall structures, archaelogical sites
- protection from wind
- temperature after the flip
- every sufficiently ethnically unique human tribe must have survived an ECDO event, because otherwise they would have had to develop their racial uniqueness within single ECDO epochs. Maybe you could model a "minimum degrees of separation", based on how much time it would take to create genetic uniqueness, to figure out the minimum genetic distance at which you could say that two different gene pools must have survived ECDO events separately
