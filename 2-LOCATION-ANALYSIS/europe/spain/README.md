# Spain

Seems like the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean will flow over most of Spain, potentially leaving only some highest peaks untouched.

Stats:
- 3000m to 5000m deep Pacific Ocean in front of it
- 6 hr rotation rotating at speeds of 1250 km/h

## Safe locations?

I'd probably go with a carefully selected location in Pyrenees.
