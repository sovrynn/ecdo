## Shetland

Cursory look at Shetland. You can see there are underwater chokepoints leading to a water surge based on speed of rotation and shape of chokepoints.

In terms of a chokepoint right in front of the island, I actually see an underwater structure that will push some of the deepest water away from Shetland (higher of the two chokepoints).

Zooming in further we see there is one bay (left) and a very narrow waterway (right).

Looking at the elevation, left bay will almost certainly flood the green plain south of it. On the waterway, there's room for the water to rise while not inundating the island much.

I drew a (very) lenient depth of water displacement (deepest oceans might get pushed away by first underwater "obstacle". It's over 700m deep on average. The water surrounding the island is 140m deep. The water surge will be 560m. An island with a highest peak of 450m is not going to streamline a water surge of 560m (on the conservative side) regardless of speed.

Verdict: Shetland will be completely submerged by the water surge.

## Great Britain Coast

This is a great illustration of these MASSIVE clay and other sediment layers that underlie GB (Dorset and Devonshire), sloping down into the sea.

### Investigating Ripples Potentially Related to ECDO

I'm not sure this is going to work but I have taken some screenshots of ripples I have found where I live on the East Yorkshire coast on permanent pasture that has likely never been cultivated or developed. The ripples are small. Max about 1 metre high and 10 metres wide. These lie on top of the original cliff top that is buried in sediment. This sediment makes up about half my county and all of its present coastline along the North Sea. Hopefully this will be clear in the coming images...

Ripple sites (A,B,C). Blue line is the original buried coastline. Everything to the East is land made of sediment (Boulder Clay):

## Nobulart Response

Do you know what the main crops in this area are? These appear to be of agricultural origin. Old swales or forestry planting rows perhaps. They appear too regular and grouped at conflicting angles to be flow ripples.I have access to some high-res DEM imagery for the UK. I'll pull it up.
