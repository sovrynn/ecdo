# Europe

Europe, being centered around the 31 Meridian, has to traverse a lot of net distance during the ECDO rotation.

## Overview

Europe [detail]. Bathymetry, topography and ECDO-derived displacement for S1>S2>S1 [1].  Note the extensive buffer afforded to most of Europe by Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the North Sea continental shelf, most of which is little more than 100m deep [pink areas on the bathymetry map]. Norway, Sweden and Finland all exhibit uniform stratification in their geology running from the northwest to the southeast, along the ECDO moment of inertia. Current ripple morphology is unlikely in this area where the water flows would be heavily disrupted by the rocky terrain, providing little opportunity for sheet flows to be established.

## Swedish, Finnish Erratics

This flow direction once again almost perfect describes how Swedish and Finish erratics might have traveled 800km SE to Belarus. Not saying it IS the case, just that it seems at least as plausible as glacial ice flowing uphill does.

## Water flow evidence

The Lichtenberg figure water flow evidence over eastern Europe and western Asia is quite spectacular on the elevation map.

## Faroe Islands

Faroe Islands. Spectacular erosion features with a distinct NNW-SSE polarization. Orange line is the ECDO displacement path.

## I can't help but wonder... [1]

I can't help but wonder whether the decreasing altitude of the Alps as we move north in this region isn't the result of progressively more intense rubble scouring as the debris from the previous peaks is added to the mix and transported on to the next. https://t.co/llyMR4aYvs

## Portugal: Serra da Estrela

Interesting mountain range in Portugal at high elevation and with some potential observatory ruins potentially.
