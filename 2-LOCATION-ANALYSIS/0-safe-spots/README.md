# Safe Spots

Look in the respective folders. I've included screenshots of flood myths that give very accurate markers of where the flood came up to on the last ECDO event.

## Eastern Pivot (SEA)

Eastern pivot safe spots, southeast Asia: Many of the highest peaks will remain above water. Bring a boat, just in case...

## Europe

Europe (Mediterranean) safe spots: Samothrace, Parnassus, Mount Othrys, Phouka/Argolis/Nemea, Mount Gerania

## Brazil

Brazil Earth flip safe spots: mountain tops of Serra do Mar, mountaintops at the mouth of the Tapirape River.

## Guiana Highlands

Mount Maiyo, Howashiwa, Homahewa

Extract these from the images into text.

You could easily run an AI analysis on the flood myths, looking for markers such as:
- specific flood levels
- duration of flooding
- rain
- droughts
- orogeny
- multiple floods
