Appears safe from deluge from S1 to S2.

## Overview [1]

Southern Africa, "The Cradle of Humankind" [1]. Seemingly has no cultural flood stories that I have found. Bears no evidence of marine inundation within the past 66 million years.[2] Has some of the longest continuously inhabited caves, some with habitation periods spanning tens of thousands of years, and going back 250ka.[3] The shallow (50-150m) Agulhas Bank and the (7500ft) Swartberg and (11,400ft) Drakensberg Mountains would present a bow-shaped aspect to the oncoming water during S2>S1, much like that of a ship, possibly diverting most of the flow. [4][5][6] The long NS striations along the western diamond coast of Namibia suggest large volumes of water may have washed up there, and that those famous stones weren't carried dozens of kilometers up the coast and inland from Oranjemund by any ordinary ocean current.[7] Red line is the ECDO displacement path.

## Youngest Marine Incursion Evidence (evidence that South Africa doesn't get inundated?)

Youngest marine incursion evidence in SA is all along the coastlines at 6-7ka. Inland deposits (north of the Swartberg) are over 6 million years old.

There's an additional possibility here. During state 2 the water will retreat from the new polar lands due its centrifugal migration back toward the new equator. A 200ft drop in sea level around the southern part of Africa would expose most of the continental shelf, thereby further buffering the main land mass from the water interface during S2>S1.

## Saltwater Lakes

Red are saltwater, green are freshwater.

## Oranjemund

### Oranjemund Analysis

![](img/oranjemund.jpg)
![](img/oranjemund2.jpg)

This is the diamond coast, from Oranjemund northwards. See the flow indications running north from the coast here. It comes at least 50km inland (probably more). I haven¬¥t looked closely here yet, but I¬¥d say that everything to the west of the red line (the ECDO moment) would be at risk returning from S2 to S1.

![](img/oranjemund3.jpg)

Red arrow marks pretty much the only point near to 5,000 ft in the region to the East of Oranjemund.

## Etosha Speculative Convo

![](img/etosha.jpg)

If you look at the topography, and the locations of the salt pans, it looks like ocean water makes it way up via SA west coast / Namibia and then settles in the localized low areas.

The location of Etosha is quite interesting. Looks like only one way in is via the east.

Yeah, looks like a lot of water moves on the west coast. Etosha is right there.

It might slosh over to Etosha, or it goes via Makgadikgadi, implying quite a lot of volume makes it way up there.

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs largely part of the return flow displacing to lower ground after the S2>S1. Was etosha I saw dating on.

Makes sense for it to be flooded less frequently, given the surrounding mountains and relatively high altitude.

I reckon the flow going from S2 - S1 is diverted by the formation on the southern tip of Namibia and then makes it way up to the basin in Botswana and only a small portion makes it as far as Etosha. Even then, possibly not every time.

The flow is probably much less severe than in other parts of the globe due to the bow effect you describe.

## Swartberg Range

![](img/swartberg.png)

### Analysis

![](img/swartberg-range.jpg)

The swartberg range has quite a distinctive form - multiple walls of rock jutting out towards the ocean. Maybe its enough to preserve something here during S2>S1.

### San People Genetic Uniqueness

Seems to suggest that there's a good anomaly in that region, across multiple 12000 year cycles. The genetic isolation & then rejoining the gene pool is also interesting.

Ditto cave drawings across the area.

*"Brenna Henn and colleagues found that the «ÇKhomani San, as well as the Sandawe and Hadza peoples of Tanzania, were the most genetically diverse of any living humans studied. This high degree of genetic diversity hints at the origin of anatomically modern humans."*

*"A 2008 study suggested that the San may have been isolated from other original ancestral groups for as much as 50,000 to 100,000 years and later rejoined, re-integrating into the rest of the human gene pool."*

## Eswatini Border Cave

Looks to be some topographical and visual evidence of flows in this area.

If you look at the underwater terrain near the coast in this area, you can see an underwater chokepoint that would lead to a surge in the above coastal area.

## Makgadikgadi

Makgadikgadi estimated to have last been wet 16ka BP.

## Fynbos

![](img/fynbos.png)

"The fynbos ecoregion is within the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. In fields related to biogeography, fynbos is known for its exceptional degree of biodiversity and endemism, consisting of about 80% (8,500 fynbos) species of the Cape floral kingdom, where nearly 6,000 of them are endemic."

"The region occupies less than 0.5% of Africa's land area but supports approximately 20% of its plant life."

## "Elite" Planning Speculation

Something that's been bothering me... South Africa appears to be a prime location for surviving the flip. Good weather. No inundation. Potentially good weather during S2. Why is it not being utilized for this purpose by the western elite? Why, instead of using it in some way, they encourage the country's self-destruction? Or am I missing anything?

In many respects, it is. 

I heard the family who own a major global food & beverage empire might be setting up places for some of their heirs (in the broader region.)

A number of ZA $ billionaires (like the Oppenheimers, the Ruperts etc) could live anywhere in the world but they still base themselves there. 

ZA's tax system isn't optimal though, so unless you want the ZA govt to tax you on your world wide income, you have to be careful how you base yourself there, as an UHNW. 

It also has other factors to consider like (violent) crime & corruption. Although, given how other western  locations are rapidly deteriorating recently, that may soon be moot. 

The government has also made it harder to emigrate there, for past "colonialist" reasons, especially for Caucasians. You have to have a skill they want etc. Even then, they've been throttling visas lately, to try force the skills transfer to locals. It's impacting foreign companies bringing in staff to run subsidiaries.

Political leaders like Malema vocally calling for the extinction of the (minority) white population also causes perception issues.

I know a foreigner HNW, who lived there for over 7 years but didn't naturalise. They recently messed him around on his visa renewal & he refused to pay exorbitant bribes to sort it out, so even though he owns property there, he can't live there full-time, for some reason.

You need to know where to base yourself too & be willing to live (currently) with the crime rate (can be violent), very high unemployment rates (60% youth unemployment & high poverty) & the social issues it creates, deteriorating infrastructure (electricity with frequent load shedding, water, sewerage, healthcare etc).

Most Westerners don't understand Africa. And they often write it off (in racist ways.) They just can't get their heads around the various risks.

South Africans are also not everyone's cup of tea. It has its own culture. 

But if you can handle all that, psyche yourself up to deal with any S1 potentially barbaric/violent outcomes, it's a great place, decent weather & üëçüèª S1 (albeit a tad colder than it currently is) and S2 is ok üëçüèªtoo.

## Wealthy Families

The Oppenheimers have been here for well over a century. DeBeers mining company was founded by Cecil Rhodes and the Rothschilds in the late 1800‚Äôs. The Oppenheimer‚Äôs assumed control of the company in the early 1920‚Äôs.

## South Africa Resource Abundance

Here‚Äôs a thought. If the event occurs as anticipated, then SA will be one of the few places which isn‚Äôt covered with considerable diluvial deposits during the rotation. It‚Äôs also one of the most mineral rich regions on the planet. Many of the essentials for rebuilding are found here. After an ECDO it would be one of the only places where minerals are still abundantly accessible at the surface.

In the movie 2012 the African continent is the one that was not inundated and the new place for civilization to grow. Highest point on earth was the Drackensberg mountain range. Check it out. Maybe they do tell us after all.

S Africa is immensely rich in mineral wealth. Lesotho is also a prime spot.

No wonder the Jewberg Facebook character built his hideout in hawaii. The antipode of South Africa

# TODO

Southern Africa going to be blasted with hot air from the Sahara at 900+km/h?

Thing that still confuses me is the lack of marine fossils in South Africa - nothing since around 66 million years ago.
