# Technical Tools

This folder is for tools, data, and development resources that help investigate the ECDO.

## Contents

- `dev`: Scripts for generating rotational path KML files and 2D visualizations.
- `google-earth`: Google Earth Pro KMZ files.
- `datasets`: Links to various datasets.

## Mapping

For elevation, [here](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map/?center=14.43468%2C0.17578&popup=68.02073%2C175.78125) is an excellent interactive web map from [TessaDEM](https://tessadem.com/). 

Here is an interactive web [flooding map](https://floodmap.net).

Google's mapping tools are excellent:
- Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/d/
- Google Earth: https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/
- Google Earth Pro (desktop app)
- Google Earth Scripting (need Google account): https://code.earthengine.google.com

3D globe, temperature data: https://earth.nullschool.net

## Ocean floor mapping

Ocean mapping:
- [NOAA Ocean Exploration Data Atlas](https://ncei.noaa.gov/maps/ocean-exploration-data-atlas)

## Lat/long tools

Here is a [lat/long distance calculator](https://latlongdata.com/distance-calculator).

Here is a [lat/long elevation webapp](https://latlongdata.com/elevation).

Lat/long follows a Cartesian coordinate system. East is right on the x-axis, North is up on the y-axis.

## Solar system

NASA solar system simulator: https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/

- Celestia is great for large-scale models.
- Stellarium is great for ground-based observations.
- https://theskylive.com and https://solarsystemscope.com are a good online resources.
- https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons is the go to for the best ephemeris data (used in many of these models, I'm sure).

## Search engine

Google search tricks:
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-google-like-a-pro-10-tips-for-effective-googling/
	- Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match
	- Search for a particular filetype with `filetype:<extension>`
- `X AROUND([word #]) Y`

# TODO Other Tools

Google earth engine scripting

I'd really like topography lines on Google Earth
