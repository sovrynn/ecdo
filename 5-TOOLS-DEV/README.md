# Technical Tools

This folder is for tools, data, and development resources that help investigate the ECDO.

## Contents

- `dev`: Scripts for generating rotational path KML files and 2D visualizations.
- `google-earth`: Google Earth Pro and Google Earth Engine resources.
- `datasets`: Links to various datasets.

## Mapping

For elevation, [here](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map/?center=14.43468%2C0.17578&popup=68.02073%2C175.78125) is an excellent interactive web map from [TessaDEM](https://tessadem.com/). 

Here is an interactive web [flooding map](https://floodmap.net).

Google's mapping tools are excellent:
- Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/d/
- Google Earth: https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/
- Google Earth Pro (desktop app)
- Google Earth Scripting (need Google account): https://code.earthengine.google.com

3D globe, temperature data: https://earth.nullschool.net

Ocean mapping:
- Google Earth Pro
- [NOAA Ocean Exploration Data Atlas](https://ncei.noaa.gov/maps/ocean-exploration-data-atlas)

## Lat/long tools

Here is a [lat/long distance calculator](https://latlongdata.com/distance-calculator).

Here is a [lat/long elevation webapp](https://latlongdata.com/elevation).

Lat/long follows a Cartesian coordinate system. East is right on the x-axis, North is up on the y-axis.

## Data viz tools

- Google Colab
- KDE LabPlot: https://labplot.kde.org
	- produces LML files

## Solar system

Solar system simulators:
- Radially uniform orbits, changing dates only seems to work on mobile: https://www.theplanetstoday.com/
- Real scale orbits: https://theskylive.com

NASA solar system simulator: https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/

- Celestia is great for large-scale models.
- Stellarium is great for ground-based observations.
- https://solarsystemscope.com good online resources
- https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons is the go to for the best ephemeris data (used in many of these models, I'm sure).

You might enjoy this fun visualizing tool.  This Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool displays Keplerian and perturbed orbits of NEOs (including Encke).  Not sure if this link will work, but give it a try: https://neotools.ssa.esa.int/sovt?c=MTA3OQ==

EUHFORIA Model

Site to look at discovered planetary formation instead of having to plug it into a stellar calendar: https://starwalk.space/en/news/what-is-planet-parade#when-will-5-to-7-planets-align-in-the-sky

## Fluid dynamics simulation

- [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/), open source
- Gerris, open source
- Lattice Boltzmann Method implementations such as Palabos
- SimScale: cloud based, free and paid versions
- Blender

## Search engine

Google search tricks:
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-google-like-a-pro-10-tips-for-effective-googling/
	- Use quotes to get an "EXACT" match
	- Search for a particular filetype with `filetype:<extension>`
- `X AROUND([word #]) Y`
