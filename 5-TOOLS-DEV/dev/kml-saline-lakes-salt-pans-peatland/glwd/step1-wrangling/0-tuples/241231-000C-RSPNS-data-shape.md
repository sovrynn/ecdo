### Interpretation of Raster Shape `(33600, 86400)`

If your raster data has a shape of `(33600, 86400)`, it means:
- **33,600 rows** (height of the grid).
- **86,400 columns** (width of the grid).

#### What This Tells You:
1. **Spatial Extent**:
   - Each cell (pixel) corresponds to a specific geographic area, based on the spatial resolution.
   - For example:
     - If the resolution is **30 meters per pixel**, the raster covers:
       - Width: `86400 × 30 = 2,592,000 meters` (2,592 km).
       - Height: `33600 × 30 = 1,008,000 meters` (1,008 km).

2. **High Resolution**:
   - A large shape indicates very detailed or high-resolution data (small pixels).
   - Higher resolutions result in larger datasets, requiring more memory and processing time.

3. **Memory Considerations**:
   - The memory required to load this data depends on the data type:
     - Example: If each value is a 16-bit integer (2 bytes), the memory needed is:
       - `33,600 × 86,400 × 2 bytes = ~5.8 GB`
     - If the data is 32-bit (4 bytes per cell), it doubles to ~11.6 GB.

### Next Steps:
- **Check the CRS and Resolution**:
  Use the `profile` metadata in the script to confirm the raster’s coordinate reference system (CRS) and cell size:
  ```python
  print("CRS:", profile['crs'])
  print("Resolution:", profile['transform'][0], "meters per pixel")
