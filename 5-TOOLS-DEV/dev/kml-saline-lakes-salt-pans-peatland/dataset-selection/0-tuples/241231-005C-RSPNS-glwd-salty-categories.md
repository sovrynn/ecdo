# Classes Corresponding to Salty or Brackish Water

The following classes represent ecosystems influenced by salinity:

- **02 Saline lake**: Lakes with high salinity levels.
- **28 Mangrove**: Found in coastal, brackish, or saline water environments.
- **29 Saltmarsh**: Coastal areas dominated by salt-tolerant plants, influenced by salty or brackish water.
- **30 Delta**: Often includes brackish zones where river and sea water mix (not always salty).
- **31 Other coastal wetland**: Likely influenced by saline or brackish water due to coastal location.
- **32 Salt pan, saline/brackish wetland**: Specifically associated with saline or brackish water conditions.

These classes capture various ecosystems directly influenced by saline water or mixed saltwater environments.
