### Mangroves
- **Typical Locations**:
  - Found mostly along tropical and subtropical coastlines.
  - Thrive in intertidal zones like estuaries, lagoons, and mudflats.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Can occur inland in saline environments such as salt flats or inland lagoons.
  - Sometimes planted in non-coastal areas for restoration or carbon sequestration.
- **Key Conditions**:
  - Require saline or brackish water, tropical/subtropical climates, and low-oxygen soils.

### Saltmarshes
- **Typical Locations**:
  - Almost always coastal, located in sheltered areas like estuaries, bays, and behind barrier islands.
  - Found in intertidal zones influenced by regular tidal flooding.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Inland saline environments (e.g., salt flats or salt lakes) can host similar ecosystems, but these are saline wetlands, not true saltmarshes.
  - Can form in artificial saline conditions (e.g., salt evaporation ponds).
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Require brackish to saline water, salt-tolerant vegetation, and low-energy environments for sediment accumulation.
