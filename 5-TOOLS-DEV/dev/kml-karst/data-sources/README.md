# Data Sources

Data sources. There aren't any great ones.

I'm really looking for karst terrain, karst outcrops, not karst underground water

# KROW

KROW never published their work, just a paper... how useless

they did cit some nice maps https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5023/06hollings.htm

# WHYMAP, WOKAM (looks like the one to use, transfer to kml)

World Karst Aquifer Map (WOKAM): As part of the World-wide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Programme (WHYMAP), WOKAM offers detailed information on the distribution of karst aquifers globally. This map enhances the understanding of karst groundwater resources within the context of global water issues and serves as a basis for further research and management strategies.

# Wokas

World Karst Spring hydrograph (WoKaS) Database: WoKaS is a comprehensive compilation of karst spring discharge observations from around the world. It includes over 400 spring discharge datasets collected from researchers, national hydrological databases, and agencies in various countries. This dataset aims to support research and management of the world's fastest-flowing groundwater systems.

This one doesn't have very good global coverage. The data sources are mostly

The first version of the world map of carbonate rocks appeared in Ford Williams (1989) Karst Geomorphology and Hydrology. A revision was published in Williams Ford (2006) Zeitschrift f√ºr Geomorphologie Suppl-Vol 147, 1-2, and used in Ford Williams (2007) Karst Hydrogeology and Geomorphology (Wiley). This v3.0 revision is in greater detail and attempts to differentiate those areas where carbonate rocks are relatively pure and continuous from those where they are abundant but discontinuous or impure. It was prepared by Paul Williams and Yin Ting Fong using a multitude of sources the most important of which are acknowledged in Williams Ford (2006). The map was assembled using GIS on an Eckert IV equal-area projection. Most carbonate rocks are susceptible to karstification, although not all are well karstified. Thus the area of carbonate rock outcrop provides an upper limit on the area of exposed karst terrain. Extensive karstified carbonate rock also exists in subcrop, but is not mapped here.
