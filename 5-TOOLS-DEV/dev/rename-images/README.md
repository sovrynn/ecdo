# Rename Image Script

Chatgpt Prompt: `Kindly write a script that takes two args as a command line A and B, treats A as a directory path, reads all the png and jpg images in that path, orders them by the time they were created, and renames them "B*.e", replacing * with their 1-indexed number starting in the order, and e with the corresponding png or jpg extension.`
