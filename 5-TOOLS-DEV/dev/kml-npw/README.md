# prompt

Write a python script that takes one input arg a relative file.

That file has one data entry per row, lon lat year space separated.

I want you to take each coord, put them all into a KML, and plot them with a red circle.

Write the output kml to output.kml

Parameterize the marker size, marker icon, and marker color so I can easily change it.
