These stations were classified according to the length of record and population setting. The four sub-regions are also shown: NEUR=Northern Europe; WSIB=Western Siberia; CSIB=Central Siberia; ESIB=Eastern Siberia. Locations of the 23 meteorological stations used in our study.

Lower part: typical example of the seasonal tree-ring δ 13 C pattern in two tree rings of oak (Quercus petraea) from N-Ireland. The tree rings were divided into slices of 40µm. Upper part: the corresponding monthly mean values of temperature (lines) and precipitation (bars). +27 Lower part: typical example of the seasonal tree-ring δ 13 C pattern in two tree rings of oak (Quercus petraea) from N-Ireland.
