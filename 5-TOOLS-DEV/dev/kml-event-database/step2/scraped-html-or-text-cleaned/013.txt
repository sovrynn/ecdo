Tephra Set K--PRE-1980 TEPHRA-FALL DEPOSITS ERUPTED FROM MOUNT ST. HELENS, WASHINGTON

U. S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1563

Tephra set K consists of a series of at least 10 thin beds of pumiceous and lithic ash and small lapilli. It commonly forms a relatively obscure gray, stratified band between thick, oxidized ash-rich deposits east and south of the volcano. No large lapilli or bombs were found in the set. All its tephra beds are fine grained as well as thin, compared with tephras in the underlying and overlying sets of Pleistocene age. No distinctive beds were recognized within set K, and no layers or beds are described individually. 

A tephra sequence that includes two layers of lapilli, each 30-40 cm thick, interbedded with several tens of thinner ash beds was observed between sets M and S in a single, disturbed outcrop 8 km northeast of the volcano. Pumice in that sequence is mineralogically similar to that in set K, but the relation of those strata to the fine-grained set K east and south of the volcano is not known.

Generally, set K strata are partly oxidized and brownish gray, but pumice lapilli are not weathered enough to be noticeably soft. At least two thin, oxidized zones within the set suggest short time breaks during its deposition. At most outcrops, the tephras are only patchily preserved; burrowing animals and other near-surface disturbances have almost everywhere strongly affected these thin deposits.

Set K consists chiefly of finely vesicular pumice along with abundant lithic fragments. Ferromagnesian mineral suites in pumice of the set consist mostly of cummingtonite and hornblende. Small amounts of biotite were found, but not consistently, and are not diagnostic of the set. Because its composition is not distinctive, set K is identified only by its stratigraphic position, characteristic thin beds, and fine grain size.

Set K is both underlain and overlain near the volcano by 100-200 cm of oxidized, ash-rich deposits, that generally are as thick or thicker than set K itself. Commonly, both the base and top of the set are so disturbed that its stratigraphic boundaries are uncertain.

Set K is present fairly consistently from east of the volcano clockwise to the south, below altitudes of 600 m. In areas 10-15 km east and southeast of the volcano, it commonly is 30-50 cm thick. Sixteen kilometers south of the volcano, it is almost entirely ash and is about 10 cm thick. The deposits of set K that are preserved probably do not represent the primary thickness of the set because unknown thicknesses of the tephra have been mixed into underlying and overlying deposits.

Pumice lapilli layers and interbedded ash deposits 8 km northeast of the volcano, which might be correlative with set K, are as thick as 200 cm. The two coarse, thick pumice layers that were observed there probably extend much farther to the northeast but were not traced or specifically identified elsewhere.

Set K apparently is between about 20,000 and 19,000 years old, based on carbonized wood recovered from pyroclastic-flow deposits. South of Mount St. Helens, sets K and M both overlie a pyroclastic-flow deposit dated at 20,350 ±350 years old. Southeast and south of the volcano, respectively, carbonized wood samples from pyroclastic-flow deposits that overlie set K have been dated as 19,160 ± 250 and 18,560 ± 180 years old.

Set S is characterized by two conspicuous yellow to brown pumice lapilli and bomb layers that overlie yellowish-gray, finer layers of chiefly ash. In the field, that series of beds of those colors and grain sizes is almost diagnostic of set S. The two coarse layers at its top dominate the set east of the volcano, but the underlying finer strata are more widespread and locally are thicker. Pumice in the set is somewhat weathered, in many places enough that pumice lumps are soft and readily broken or cut. Near the volcano, tephra in the lower and middle parts of the set typically is interbedded with deposits of ash-cloud or other flowage origin.

Dacitic pumice makes up most of set S, especially in the coarser strata. Ferromagnesian mineral suites consist chiefly of cummingtonite and olive to brownish hornblende. Brown hornblende makes up as much as half of the hornblende fraction and appears to be more abundant than in sets K and M. Hypersthene is sparse in layer Sw, in the middle of the set, but makes up several percent of the ferromagnesian mineral fraction in most other layers.

Set S was recognized all around the volcano except directly to the northwest and it is thickest, coarsest, and most complete toward the east-northeast and east. Toward the east, it is commonly 50-70 cm thick at distances of 10-15 km from the volcano. At 10-15 km north and south of the volcano, where only one or two lapilli-bearing beds are present, the set as a whole generally is only 10-20 cm thick. Toward the southwest and west, it is even thinner, and only one lapilli-bearing layer was found.

Downwind, as many as three beds of set S have been identified at multiple sites in eastern Washington as far as about 300 kilometers from the volcano.

Set S apparently was erupted between about 13,600 and 12,500 years ago, and probably close to about 13,000 years ago. About 50 km northeast of Mount St. Helens, peat from below and above set S tephra in a bog has been dated at about 13,650 and 12,120 years B.P., respectively. On the south flank of the volcano, a date of about 12,910 years was obtained for charred wood from a pyroclastic-flow deposit that underlies one layer of set S tephra there and is compositionally similar to the tephra.

All the described layers in set S crop out directly east of the volcano, although the tephra strata in the lower part of the set there are thin and interbedded with thicker ash beds of probable flowage origin. Set S tephras also crop out on the north, west, and south sides of the volcano, but their relation to layers described east of the volcano is not known, and they were not identified specifically or described separately.

Two thin oxidization zones in the lower part of set S were found at a few outcrops. These may represent surface oxidation and record brief weathering periods between eruptions, or they may represent only staining by oxidized material deposited from ground water. 

Set J consists mostly of multiple coarse pumice layers that together form a thick, brown deposit characterized by lapilli and bombs both east and west of the volcano. Toward the east, two pumiceous lapilli and bomb layers overlie thin ash; to the west, the set consists of one coarse, thick layer. Lithic material is sparse, and no layers of lithic fragments were found.

Set J is the only coarse, thick, and strongly oxidized tephra set at Mount St. Helens that has a ferromagnesian mineral suite dominated by hypersthene and hornblende. These features readily distinguish it from all other tephra sets of the volcano. In the field, set J can commonly be recognized simply by its coarse grain size and color, which is darker than the yellow to pale-brown colors typical of the underlying and overlying tephra sets S and Y.

Sets J has been identified in all directions from the volcano except to the north. From the northeast to southeast, it typically consists of 50-100 cm of lapilli and small bombs at distances of 5-15 km from the volcano. It crops out only sparsely north-northeast of the volcano and has been strongly disturbed wherever found in that direction. Farther downwind towards the east, the tephra has been identified as far as about 700 km from the volcano in Montana.
