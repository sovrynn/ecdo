Abstract
Coastal fen- and lake deposits enclose sand layers that record at least three Holocene tsunamis at the Shetland Islands. The oldest is the well-known Storegga tsunami (ca 8100 cal yr BP), which at the Shetlands invaded coastal lakes and ran up peaty hillsides where it deposited sand layers up to 9.2 m above present high tide level. Because sea level at ca 8100 cal yr BP was at least 10–15 m below present day sea level, the runup exceeded 20 m. In two lakes, we also found deposits from a younger tsunami dated to ca 5500 cal yr BP. The sediment facies are similar to those of the Storegga tsunami—rip-up clasts, sand layers, re-deposited material and marine diatoms. Runup was probably more than 10 m. Yet another sand layer in peat outcrops dates to ca 1500 cal yr BP. This sand layer thins and fines inland and was found at two sites 40 km apart and traced to ca 5–6 m above present high tide. The oldest tsunami was generated by the Storegga slide on the Norwegian continental slope. We do not know what triggered the two younger events.
Introduction
About 8100 calendar years ago (ca 7300 14C yr BP) a large tsunami inundated the shores around the Norwegian Sea and North Sea. The tsunami was generated from the Storegga slide (2400 km3) west of Norway (Fig. 1; Bondevik et al., in press). Tsunami deposits from this event have been discovered in eastern Scotland (Dawson et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Dawson and Smith, 2000), in western Norway (Bondevik et al., 1997a; Bondevik, 2003) and the Faeroe Islands (Grauert et al., 2001; Bondevik et al., 2005). In Shetland, between Norway and Scotland (Fig. 1), a sand layer in peat had been interpreted to be deposited from a tsunami (Smith, p. 58 in Birnie et al., 1993). Radiocarbon dates of peat next to this sand layer indicated that it was deposited around 5500 14C yr BP, and so it appeared to be almost 2000 years younger than the Storegga tsunami. We investigated this layer more carefully and re-dated the sand layer by 14C AMS dating plant fragments and wood extracted from the peat. The results showed that the sand layer represented the Storegga tsunami event and that the previous peat dates were wrong (Bondevik et al., 2003). However, during this work we discovered two younger events that we also believe represent tsunamis. These two younger events are the main focus of this paper.
The volume, velocity and initial acceleration to a submarine slide are the important properties to whether a tsunami will be initiated from it or not. Numerical simulations indicate that slides as small as 5 km3 in the Storegga area (Fig. 1) could generate waves with surface elevations of about 1–3 m along the Norwegian coast (De Blasio et al., 2003; Løvholt et al., 2005). Mapping of the sea floor in the recent years has revealed other large Holocene slides (Fig. 1) as the Trænadjupet slide (Laberg and Vorren, 2000); the Andøya slide (Laberg et al., 2000), a slide area on the NE Faroe margin (van Weering et al., 1998; Kuijpers et al., 2001) and the small Afen slide (Long et al., 2003). Except for the Afen slide all of these slides are probably large enough to generate tsunamis.
In this paper, we report deposits from three separate tsunamis on Shetland. The oldest is the Storegga tsunami; deposits from which are present both in peat outcrops and lakes (Bondevik et al., 2003). Two lake basins also contain a younger event dated to ca 5500 cal yr BP which sediment facies are similar to the Storegga tsunami. The youngest event dates to ca 1500 cal yr BP and is a thin sand layer in peat.

Depositories for tsunami sediments and methods
Tsunami deposits are well preserved in coastal lakes inundated by tsunamis (e.g. Bondevik et al., 1997b). Shetland has about 2500 freshwater lakes, called lochs. Some are cut off from the sea by beach bars, many have been formed behind barriers of peat blocking the drainage of flat areas, but at least 1000 occupy rock basins carved out by glacier ice (Flinn, 1980). In this study, we have cored several such lake basins with a bedrock threshold close to present sea level.

Sea level changes on Shetland
In order to estimate tsunami runups, the sea level at the time of the tsunamis has to be known. On Shetland, marine sediments or other landforms associated with shore processes do not exist onshore. Around the entire islands, present beach ridges can be found to rest on peat. For instance at Maggie Kettle's Loch (Fig. 5) we found about a metre of peat beneath the present beach ridge.
The Holocene sea level history on Shetland has never been investigated in any detail and only a few data exist.
A sand layer in peat
At both sides of the Sullom Voe (Fig. 2) there is a distinct sand layer in peat. At Garths Voe (Fig. 5) the sand layer, first discovered by Birnie (1981), was traced up to ca 6 m above high tide and interpreted to be a tsunami deposit by Smith (p. 58 in Birnie et al., 1993). Radiocarbon dates of 1-cm slices of bulk peat at contacts above and below the layer were dated by them to 5700 14C yr BP below and 5300 14C yr BP above the sand layer, almost 2000 years younger than the age of the Storegga
The Garth tsunami event (ca 5500 cal yr BP)
In Garth in South Nesting (Fig. 2, Fig. 7), we cored two lake basins close to present sea level. The first, named Garth Loch by us is a small lake basin found just above the high tide level. The other is Loch of Benston, draining into Garth Loch and located at 1.6 m higher elevation (Fig. 7). Both lakes show a similar stratigraphy with two superimposed units consisting of typical tsunami facies, separated by normal lacustrine deposits. The oldest is dated to Storegga tsunami age and the younger
Ayre of Dury in Dury Voe
A sand layer is seen in numerous peat outcrops from the shore and some 400 m inland at the Ayre of Dury (Fig. 2, Fig. 8). The sand layer is 1–5 cm thick and has a sharp lower boundary. The sand is fine to medium grained and rests on ca 1 m of peat (Fig. 9). However, in a small depression inland, we cored about 2.5 m of peat and organic sediments below the sand. The sand layer was traced to 5.6 m above high tide level towards the eastern valley slope. Along the valley floor it was traced about 400 m
Discussion
The tsunami deposits reported here occur on the north and east coasts of Shetland (Fig. 2). We did not discover any tsunami deposits in the western part (e.g. the basin 2 m below high tide at Bridge of Walls) or in the southern part (e.g. basin in Aiths Voe south of Lerwick located ca 1 m above high tide, Fig. 2). If a tsunami inundated these areas, runup was probably less than the subsequent sea level rise; i.e. the tsunami did not reach as high as the present day shore. This geographical
Conclusions

(1) We have identified deposits from three tsunamis on Shetland. The oldest is the Storegga tsunami dated to ca 8100 cal yr BP (or ca 7300 14C yr BP), a younger event called Garth tsunami dates to ca 5500 cal yr BP (4800 yr 14C yr BP) and the youngest is about 1500 years old. (2) Deposits from the Storegga tsunami were found at several sites in the Sullom Voe area, in two lake basins in South Nesting and in two lake basins on the island of Unst. Based on empirical sea level data runup is at least 20 m in the Sullom
