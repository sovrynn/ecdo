Knight Although extreme-wave events are frequent along the northwestern coast of Western Australia and tsunamis in 1994 and 2006 induced considerable coastal flooding locally, robust stratigraphical evidence of prehistoric tropical cyclones and tsunamis from this area is lacking. Based on the analyses of X-ray computed microtomography (μCT) of oriented sediment cores, multi-proxy sediment and microfaunal analyses, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and 14C-AMS dating, this study presents detailed investigations on an allochthonous sand layer of marine origin found in a back-barrier depression on the NW Cape Range peninsula. The event layer consists of material from the adjacent beach and dune, fines and thins inland, and was traced up to ~ 400 m onshore. Although a cyclone-induced origin cannot entirely be ruled out, the particular architecture and fabric of the sediment, rip-up clasts and three subunits point to deposition by a tsunami. As such, it represents the first stratigraphical evidence of a prehistoric, mid-Holocene tsunami in NW Western Australia. It was OSL-dated to 5400–4300 years ago, thus postdating the regional mid-Holocene sea-level highstand.

Introduction The NW coast of Western Australia is impacted by 1–2 tropical cyclones per year, and ten tsunamis have been recorded since 1858, including those following the 1883 Krakatoa eruption and the earthquakes off the coast of Indonesia in 1977, 1994 and 2006 (Goff and Chagué-Goff, 2014). Although observations during these tsunamis are rather sporadic, wave heights of ~6 m (Cape Leveque) and a run-up of ~8 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) (Shelter Bay, Shark Bay) locally occurred during the 1977 Sumba and 2006 Java tsunamis, respectively (Prendergast and Brown, 2012; Goff and Chagué-Goff, 2014). At the North West Cape, the 1994 Java tsunami overwashed the dune barrier at Baudin (Fig. 1), 3.6 km S of the study area. Inundation extended up to 300 m inland, and a run-up of ~ 7 m AHD was inferred (Gregson and van Reeken, 1998). In addition, tropical cyclones cause extensive coastal flooding. As one of the most powerful cyclones in Australia's historical record, category 5 tropical cyclone Vance (March 18th–22nd, 1999) resulted in water levels of ~7 m above event tide in the Exmouth Gulf (Nott and Hubbert, 2005). However, little is known about the geological imprint of historical (Prendergast and Brown, 2012; May et al., 2015a) and prehistorical extreme-wave events in northwestern Western Australia. So far, prehistorical tsunamis or storms were inferred from corals or large molluscs in washover deposits and dunes up to 1 km inland, or from marine organisms attached to wave-emplaced boulders (Scheffers et al., 2008, and references therein). These findings lack stratigraphic contexts, and uncertainties related to radiocarbon dating of reworked marine organisms (May et al., 2015a) or the marine palaeo-reservoir effect may bias the inferred chronologies. This paper provides, for the first time, detailed stratigraphic evidence of a prehistoric extreme-wave event from northwestern Western Australia. Based on multi-proxy sediment and microfaunal analyses, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and 14C-dating, an allochthonous sand layer of marine origin was identified in a mud-filled back-barrier depression at the NW coast of the Cape Range peninsula. As a novel approach in the context of tsunami deposits, X-ray computed microtomography (μCT) scans of oriented cores reveal characteristic sediment fabrics, which have been described from modern (Wassmer et al., 2010) and historical (Cuven et al., 2013) tsunami deposits but are rarely preserved in palaeotsunami deposits. We discuss the origin of the event layer against the background of its sedimentary characteristics and the local sedimentary environment. Sedimentary Geology 332 (2016) 40–50 Corresponding author.

Physical setting Investigations were carried out in the low-lying back-barrier zone at Ninety Mile Beach access (21°50′28.03″S, 114°2′54.06″E), located in the northwestern part of the NW Cape (Western Australia). The site comprises a circular mudflat some 200 m from the sea, and slightly elevated low and open shrublands. A dune belt of ~ 5 m AHD separates the site from the Ningaloo Reef, the local producer of bioclastic skeletal fragments. Heavy winds, sustained rainfall and severe flooding are mainly related to tropical cyclones during summer. The post-glacial marine transgression approached its maximum at ~ 7000–6000 years BP, when the formation of the Ningaloo Reef off the NW Cape had just started (Collins et al., 2003). A relative sea-level (RSL) highstand of 1–2 m above present level followed by a marine regression is documented for several coastal sections of Western Australia (Lewis et al., 2013; Engel et al., 2015) and is also assumed for the NW Cape. The continuously falling RSL resulted in low sedimentation rates in coastal settings since c. 5000 years, impeding the accumulation of sediment archives suitable for storing palaeo-wave events (Nott, 2004). However, although its deposits have not yet been presented, the 1994 Java tsunami explicitly showed that considerable flooding of near-coast sediment archives may occur (Gregson and van Reeken, 1998), and palaeotsunami and palaeocyclone deposits may be stored in topographical lows. 3. Methods 3.1. Sedimentary analyses Samples were taken from cores and trenches at 16 locations along a shore-perpendicular transect crossing a circular mudflat at Ninety Mile Beach access, starting at c. 200 m from the coast. The stratigraphical transect comprises trenches T7, T20 and T35, T36 and 38, percussion cores VC31–34 and push cores C3 (master core), 22–25, 27 and 37. Percussion cores were taken using an Atlas Copco Cobra Pro percussion corer and probes of 6 cm in diameter. Push cores were taken by pushing plastic tubes also with a diameter of 6 cm into the sediment by hand. Cores and trenches reached depths between 50 and 150 cm below surface (b.s.), and sediment recovery amounted to a minimum of 90% during coring. The distance between sampling sites was between 5 and 50 m. Percussion cores and trenches were photographically documented and significant facies were sampled. Push cores were opened and sampled in the lab in steps of 0.5–1 cm. Elevation of the cores and profiles were measured using a Topcon HiPer Pro differential global positioning system (DGPS) with an altimetric accuracy of ~2 cm. Elevations given in AHD (Australian Height Datum) are based on DGPS measurements using the static mode and AUSPOS post-processing. Modern samples were taken from the present beach (EXM B), the dune (EXM D) and the lagoon some 450 m off the beach (i.e., the Holocene reef platform, TTB). The coarse- and fine-grained fractions (N2 mm and b 2 mm) were separated using a 2 mm sieve and weighed; percentage of the gravel fraction (N 2 mm) is separately illustrated for master core C3. The air-dried fine-grained fraction was carefully hand-pestled for particle disaggregation. Grain size distribution of the fine-grained fraction was measured using a Beckman Coulter LS 13320 laser particle analyser (b2 mm). Samples were pre-treated with H2O2 (30%) to remove organic carbon and 0.5 N Na4P2O7 (55.7 g/l) for aggregate dispersion. Statistical measures were calculated after Folk and Ward (1957) using the GRADISTAT software (Blott and Pye, 2001). In order to determine sedimentary environments and sediment source areas, microfaunal analyses (foraminifers, ostracods) were carried out for samples of master core C3 and for the modern samples. Samples (10 cm3 ) were pre-treated with H2O2 (30%) for dispersion and sieved to isolate fractions of N100 and b100 μm. The microfaunal content was investigated under a binocular microscope and quantitatively recorded. A minimum of ~300 (foraminifers) and ~100 (ostracods) specimens per sample were counted where possible. We distinguished reworked and non-reworked foraminifers based on the degree of fragmentation and abrasion/rounding. For determination taxa and ecological preferences, Yassini and Jones (1995), Hayward et al. (1999), De Deckker and Yokoyama (2009), and Karanovic (2012) were used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using the PAST software (Hammer et al., 2001) for samples of master core C3. For PCA, the grain size parameters mean, sorting, skewness and kurtosis as well as the percentage of microfaunal contents were included. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to avoid autocorrelations. We interpreted μCT scans of an oriented push core (C37) in order to infer information about sediment fabric as well as flow directions and characteristics. Scans were performed at HECTOR, a custom-built CT scanner setup at UGCT (Centre For X-ray Tomography, Ghent University, Belgium). The CT scanner was specifically designed for multidisciplinary CT applications and is built around a 240 kV X-RAY WorX microfocus source (XWT 240-SE) and a Perkin-Elmer flat panel detector (1620 CN3 CS). Based on the sample size and composition, optimal scanner settings were determined to be 220 kV tube voltage, 50 W beam power and 1 mm of aluminium filtration to reduce beam hardening while preserving a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio. A total of 2000 projections was recorded, with a 1-second exposure per projection. The isotropic voxel pitch of the reconstructed volume was 50 μm. The tomographic datasets were reconstructed using the Octopus software package, and the reconstructed 3D volumes were rendered using the visualisation software package VGStudio MAX. Visual interpretation was performed using myVGL 2.1 software. In addition, quantification of sediment fabrics such as the orientation and dip of the longest axes of particles and particle shape measurements were performed using ImageJ, Blob3D and Stereo32 software. Three sections of the reconstructed core (lower parts of subunits I and II) were chosen for subsampling and sediment fabric analyses. The original scans (images) were cropped and oriented towards the north using ImageJ software. Subsequent processing included adjustments of brightness and contrast as well as corrections of the signal-to-noise ratio in order to extract larger particles and remove smaller ones from the images. Subsamples were extracted from the whole dataset and transferred into Blob3D. 4. Sedimentology 4.1. Trench-scale grain size and microfaunal characteristics At the base of C3, laminated sandy mud (31–24 cm b.s.) shows layers of one to few mm thickness and mean grain size values between 4 and ~100 μm. The foraminiferal assemblage is mainly composed of well-preserved individuals of Adelosina longirostra, Quinqueloculina seminula and Quinqueloculina sp. Juvenile and adult Cyprideis australiensis, Paracypris sp., Paracytheroma sp., Xestoleberis sp. compose the ostracod assemblage. Unconformably overlying is coarse to medium sand with abundant foraminifers, shell debris and well-rounded gravel (24–6 cm b.s., unit B). A medium sand layer (24–22 cm b.s.; base of subunit B-I) comprises the bottom section. Coarse sand and gravel contents increase from 22–20 cm b.s. and decrease between 20–17 cm b.s. (top of subunit B-I). Between 17–11 cm b.s., massive sand and gravel was found, coarsening-up at 17–12 cm b.s. and fining-up at 12–11 cm b.s. (subunit B-II). The sediment lacks any gravel component and is fining-up at 10–6 cm b.s. (subunit B-III). Samples from unit B cluster based on the PCA and the sorting/mean grain size ratio. Granulometric characteristics are similar to the beach and dune, although the latter are slightly better sorted. Reworked (i.e., fragmented/rounded) Amphistegina spp. and other inner shelf taxa dominate the foraminiferal assemblages of EXM B and D as well as unit B. Sample TTB has a higher diversity and is dominated by less or non-reworked individuals of inner shelf taxa. Fresh individuals of Peneroplis pertusus are only found in unit B and TTB. While samples EXM B and D are void of ostracods, several adult specimens of C. australiensis are present in unit B. 4.2. Sediment fabric in μCT scans Similar to unit B in C3, at least two subunits with a distinct orientation of coarser shell and gravel components and graded bedding are visible in the μCT scans of oriented core C37. However, in C37, subunit B-II is fining-up. For the base of subunits B-I and B-II, the longest axes of the mainly prolate coarse particles exhibit a distinct shore-parallel orientation with a dominant dip. Well-rounded, 15 cm-large Pleistocene reef rock clasts floating in unit B were found in T20. Micro-cavities disrupt the sharp erosive boundary to unit A, resembling flame structures. Mud clasts floating in the sandy to gravelly matrix were identified in subunit B-I. The (palaeo-)surface of the underlying mud is overlain by a layer of medium to coarse sand with lower amounts of shell fragments and gravel, analogous to the base of unit B in C3. 4.3. Transect-scale sediment characteristics and chronology The sand sheet of unit B was detected in trenches and further cores along the entire transect, except for the most landward core VC31. It thins and fines landwards and is partly cemented in VC32–34 and T35. The basal layer of medium to coarse sand with reduced contents of larger mollusc fragments and gravel varies in thickness; it was not found in the landward cores. While unit B is overlain by unit C in the cores from the mudflat, it is followed by laminated sandy mud (unit D) and well-sorted fine sand (unit E) landwards. In the latter core, unit E gradually changes to muddy fine sand in its upper part. Landwards of VC32, the weathered Pleistocene reef rock emerges at the surface; VC31 penetrated deeply weathered cemented sand and red loam. Based on the weighted mean of two OSL ages from T36 and T38, unit B was deposited 4833 years ago. This is in agreement with the 14C-age of a bivalve shell from unit B, giving a maximum age for the sand sheet. Plant remains from unit A yielded an age of over 5900 years ago. The well-sorted fine sand of unit E in T38 gives an age of 3773 years. 5. Data interpretation and discussion 5.1. Sediment source and origin of unit B While the foraminiferal assemblage of unit A, dominated by inner shelf species suggests inter- to subtidal lagoonal conditions, juvenile C. australiensis indicates a protected marginal-marine palaeoenvironment. The inverse grading in the basal and normal grading in the upper part of its subunits, the distinct fining and thinning landward pattern, and the erosive boundary to underlying mudflat sediments point to an event-induced origin of unit B. Although a suite of diagnostic characteristics for the identification of palaeotsunami and palaeostorm deposits has been discussed, the detection and differentiation of storm and tsunami deposits are still associated with challenges. However, tsunamis tend to generate extensive sand sheets, generally fining inland and upwards, and comprising distinct subunits as well as an erosive lower contact. All mentioned tsunami characteristics are found in unit B, the reason why we tentatively conclude that it was deposited by a tsunami 5400–4300 years ago. 5.2. Implications on hydrodynamic conditions and depositional processes The orientation of particles deposited from suspension or traction is preserved when current velocities are sufficiently high. A flow-perpendicular orientation of the longest axes of particles is typical for bedload transport by rolling or sliding in strong currents. Inverse grading, observed at the base of subunits, is associated with traction carpets and dominant bedload transport. The poor sorting of basal layers can be attributed to the presence of a coarser fraction, which causes bimodal or close to bimodal grain size distribution. 5.3. Comparison with regional event data and RSL change Previous studies found major far-field tsunamis of similar age from geologic evidence in the northern Indian Ocean. However, the regional tsunami history and numerical models suggest that the strongest events affecting Western Australia arise from earthquakes along the Sunda megathrust. A RSL ~1 m higher than at present at the time of the tsunami and a continuous RSL fall since then involved low sedimentation rates during the mid- to late Holocene. 6. Conclusions Based on the analyses of μCT scans of oriented cores, multi-proxy sediment and microfaunal analyses, this study presents the first stratigraphic evidence of a prehistoric extreme-wave event, most likely a palaeotsunami, from the NW part of Western Australia. The candidate tsunami deposit was OSL-dated to 5400–4300 years ago. Although rarely described from palaeotsunami deposits, the good preservation of sedimentary characteristics and sediment fabric allow for inferring hydrodynamic characteristics of the event. Up to three subunits were detected within the deposit, characterised by typical inverse and normal grading. Particle orientations inferred from the μCT scans reveal that the subunits were deposited due to landward flow directions during three run-up phases of the event.
