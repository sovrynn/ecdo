Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid returning countries. Return only the location. Here's the information:

Basic description of event: Antarctic tephra database

Basic location of event: Antarctica

Specific data/information/context related to event: Antarctic Tephra Database

Application of DTSA-II Software to Cryptotephra
Accurately determining the geochemical composition of volcanic particles extracted from ice cores is crucial for establishing the source and climatic impact of the volcanic eruption. The development and application of a new quantification procedure using the NIST DTSA II software to SEM / EDS analyses is at the forefront of this current research. Once this is complete, we can better refine possible volcanic source(s) responsible for tephra layer(s) at a specific interval in a given ice core.
