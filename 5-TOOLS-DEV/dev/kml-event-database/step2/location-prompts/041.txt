Highlights

Paleoseismicity was non-stationary throughout the Late Weichselian and the Holocene in the Fennoscandian Shield area.
Three general maxima of paleoseismicity cluster around 12.0–10.0, 5.0–7.0 and 1.5–3.0 kyr BP.
A strong asymmetry of the offset in the Finnish PGF complexes indicate that the general rupture propagation was from SW to NE.
The oldest and highest magnitude events generally occurred in the SW sector of the Finnish PGF complexes.

Abstract
Sediment profiles in six lake basins located near the late- and postglacial fault surface ruptures in northern Finland were investigated for turbidites and soft-sediment deformation structures that could reveal information on the timing and spatial occurrence of paleoearthquakes in the area. We used geophysical sub-bottom profiling and lithological logging of sediment cores combined with radiocarbon and paleomagnetic dating. In three lakes, Immeljärvi, Aakenus and Laukkujärvi, sediment records provided evidence of postglacial earthquakes or landslides, whereas in three others (lakes Pyhäjärvi, Kallojärvi and Syväjärvi) no disturbance structures were observed in their sequences that cover roughly the Holocene period. Combined with previous data on paleoseismicity in Finland, the results enhance the non-stationary hypothesis of seismicity throughout the Late Weichselian and the Holocene with three general maxima that cluster around the deglaciation (12.0–10.0 kyr BP), the mid-Holocene (5.0–7.0 kyr BP) and the Late Holocene (1.5–3.0 kyr BP). A strong asymmetry of the offset profiles of the Finnish postglacial fault complexes indicate that the general rupture propagation was from SW to NE. The present data also indicates that the oldest and highest magnitude events (MW ≈ 7 or higher) generally took place in the SW sector of the Finnish PGF complexes during or soon after the retreat of the continental ice sheet. The ruptures then propagated towards the NE sector of PGF complexes in a cascading fashion and were generally characterized by lower magnitude events (MW ≈ 6) during the Holocene.
Introduction
Postglacial earthquakes and reactivation of pre-exiting bedrock fault structures during and after the Weichselian deglaciation is obvious in the Fennoscandian Shield area (e.g. Wu et al., 1999; Lagerbäck and Sundh, 2008; Olesen et al., 2004, 2013; Lund et al., 2017; Ojala et al., 2017). This hypothesis is based on the appearance of postglacial faults (PGF) that cross-cut glacial sediments, seismically-induced landslides and other complex landforms that indicate subglacial mass flow and catastrophic meltwater drainage deposits close to the known PGFs and in areas of instrumentally observed recent seismicity (e.g. Ahjos and Uski, 1992; Lagerbäck and Sundh, 2008; Olesen et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014; Sutinen et al., 2014a, 2018; 2019; Ojala et al., 2017, 2019a, 2019b). In many cases, characteristics and structure of PGFs, as well as time-distribution assessments of paleoearthquakes are based on a combination of terrain morphology from high-resolution LiDAR DEMs (Light detection and ranging digital elevation models), geophysical surveys, bedrock drilling, trench excavations and dating of soft-sediment deformation structures (e.g. Sutinen, 2005; Palmu et al., 2015; Ojala et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018a; Mattila et al., 2019). Recent studies have indicated that, contrary to a single rupture theory, multiple rupturing events can take place within ‘postglacial faults’ in northern Fennoscandia, where different or the same PGF segments within PGF system have been active several times during and after the Late Weichselian glaciation and/or after glacial phases that predated the last glacial maximum (Lagerbäck and Sundh, 2008; Smith et al., 2018a; Ojala et al., 2018a, a, 2019b, 2019c, Mattila et al., 2019). However, due to scarcity of dates from the PGFs and geologic structures genetically related to earthquakes, the full spectrum of time-distribution of late- and postglacial seismic activity in the Fennoscandian Shield area is still poorly constrained (e.g. Sutinen et al., 2005, 2014b, 2014c; Lagerbäck and Sundh, 2008; Smith et al., 2014; Ojala et al., 2018a; Smith et al., 2018a).
Lacustrine and marine deposits are ideal archives for paleoseismic investigations because they contain continuous sequences of water-saturated fine-grained sediments, which are susceptible to in-situ liquefaction and formation of soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS) (Sims, 1973; Ricci Lucchi, 1995; Owen et al., 2011). In addition, lithostratigraphic evidence of earthquakes in aquatic environment includes displacement of on-shore and offshore strata, such as mass-transport deposits, subaquatic landslides and turbidites (Sims, 1973; Owen et al., 2011). Recent studies worldwide have revealed significant continuums of seismically-induced lithologies in marine and lacustrine realms with a high temporal resolution (e.g. Beck, 2009; Howarth et al., 2012; Gràcia et al., 2013; Kremer et al., 2017; Brooks, 2018).
Documentation of PGFs, SSDS and turbidites in aquatic environments has thus far been rare in Fennoscandia. Studies that exists indicate, for example, that the Pärvie PGF could not be identified with certainty beneath Lake Torneträsk, in northern Sweden, by Vogel et al. (2013). Jakobsson et al. (2014) and Smith et al. (2018b), on the other hand, provided indirect evidence of the Early Holocene seismicity and the appearance of PGFs in glacial lacustrine sediments in lakes Vättern and Voxsjön (Bollnäs PGF), respectively. Kotilainen and Hutri (2004) and Hutri et al. (2007) conducted a thorough study of disturbed sedimentary structures in a marine sequence in the Gulf of Bothnia off coast Olkiluoto and revealed seismically-induced SSDS, which they dated to 10.2–10.65 kyr BP. More recently, Ojala et al. (2018b) described a distinct turbidite and SSDS preserved in clastic-biogenic varves of the Lake Nurmijärvi sequence, in central-southern Finland, which they connected to an earthquake at 7.4 kyr BP with moment magnitude of MW ≈ 5.1–6.9.
The focus of the present study is on dating and understanding of non-stationary postglacial seismicity in northern Fennoscandia. We also report here the results of the first systematic search for seismically-induced SSDS in the vicinity of the known PGFs in northern Finland. The new data provided in the present analysis was conducted at six lacustrine sites close to the Venejärvi–Jauhojärvi and Suasselkä PGF complexes, aiming to link terrestrial evidence of PGFs to sedimentary records using acoustic-seismic profiling and sediment drilling and description. The results and interpretations of the present study are then combined with previously published information to add to the catalogue of paleoseismic events and to offer an updated perspective on the timing and spatial recurrence of postglacial seismicity in Finland and in the entire Fennoscandian Shield area.

Study sites
The present study was conducted at six lakes in SW Finnish Lapland and close to the known PGF complexes. The PGF scarp complexes are recognized from LiDAR DEMs as surface rupture segments with a general SW–NE trending geometry that can be traced tens of kilometres. Lake Immeljärvi is located in the village of Sirkka, about 3 km SE of the Suasselkä PGF complex and in the vicinity of Levi and Pyhätunturi.
Methods
Sub-bottom profiling played a significant role in the lake surveys. They were applied to record lake bathymetry at sites that were missing this information, to have an understanding on the thickness and distribution of glacial and postglacial sediments, and to investigate slumping and faulting structures potentially related to PGFs and paleoseismic events. We used the MDCS survey software package equipped with a MD500 24/200 kHz pinger.
Results and interpretation
Based on acoustic-seismic sub-bottom profiles and GPR surveys, none of the studied lakes exhibited any major sediment slumping, faulting, folding or disturbance structures that would have been detectable in their late- to postglacial clayey and gyttja sediment sequences. Neither did we observe any gas or fluid escape structures in any of the geophysical profiles that could have been interpreted as large pockmarks in sediments.
Origin of soft-sediment deformation structures
Studies on co-seismic formations, such as paleolandslides and deformations of marine and lacustrine sediments are important because they provide indirect evidence of paleoseismicity and can often be dated with better accuracy and precision than PGF scarps. Many studies have demonstrated that turbidites, minor folding and faulting structures and completely convoluted beds of aquatic sediments can be interpreted as evidence for paleoearthquakes or directly related to modern and historical seismicity.
Conclusions
Dating of coseismic features in lake sediments and landslides (buried organic remains and basal peat) close to the late- and postglacial fault surface ruptures in northern Finland revealed that the area was characterized by non-stationary seismicity throughout the Late Weichselian and the Holocene with three general maxima that cluster around the deglaciation (12.0–10.0 kyr BP), the mid-Holocene (5.0–7.0 kyr BP) and the Late Holocene (1.5–3.0 kyr BP). Combined with a strong asymmetry of the offset profiles of the Finnish PGF complexes, this supports the understanding of the seismicity history in this region.

Time-variable strain and stress rates induced by Holocene glacial isostatic adjustment in continental interiors
2023, Tectonophysics
Citation Excerpt :

In areas where such a non-tectonic overprint is present – or has been present over the timescales used in paleoseismological studies – one must be cautious equating strain release by paleoearthquakes to present-day strain (or stressing) rates on faults. The extreme case for this is in Fennoscandia, where the crust overlain by major icesheet thicknesses during the Last Glacial Maximum is well-established to have hosted a number of major active faults and inferred earthquakes over the 10 ka since the last decay of the icesheet.

Disentangling factors controlling earthquake-triggered soft-sediment deformation in lakes
2022, Sedimentary Geology
Citation Excerpt :

Subaqueous paleoseismology aims to expand historic earthquake catalogues by studying long lacustrine and marine sedimentary sequences for imprints of past earthquakes. Earthquake-induced soft sediment deformation structures (SSDS) are a common paleoseismic indicator within these subaqueous records. Several deformation mechanisms can create earthquake-triggered SSDS, for example, liquefaction, fluidization or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability between sediment layers induced by earthquake-related shear.
