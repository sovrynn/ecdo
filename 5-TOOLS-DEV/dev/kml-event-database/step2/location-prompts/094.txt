(with contributions from A. L Brindley, L Buckley, P. Johnston, M. McQuade and I. Stuijts)
A prehistoric ring-barrow in Kilmahuddrick townland, west of Clondalkin, Dublin 22, was excavated during 2000.
Radiocarbon dates indicate activity during the Bronze Age and Iron Age. A series of cremation deposits were identi
fied within the ring-barrow and a sequence of deposits were found in the ditch. Tlte site was enclosed within a field
system of early medieval date.
INTRODUCTION
evelopment of a greenfield site in Kilmahud
drick townland, west of Clondalkin, Dublin
J_S 22, during 2000 led to the discovery of a
ploughed-out prehistoric ring-barrow (Pl. 1). The
excavations revealed a series of cremated bone deposits
at its centre.1 The remains of an early medieval field
system, represented by several shallow linear ditches,
were found nearby.
The site was being developed as a biotechnological
complex by Wyeth Medica Ireland. Geophysical survey
in advance of the development detected an anomaly
that resembled a ring-barrow in Kilmahuddrick town
land (GSB 2000). Archaeological test-trenching by the
writer confirmed this identification.The site was exea
vated during July-September 2000 by the writer for
Margaret Gowen and Co. Ltd. It was not marked on
Ordnance Survey maps and was not listed in the
Record of Monuments and Places.
The townland of Kilmahuddrick is located west of
Clondalkin village and the M50 motorway, in the
direction of Newcastle (Fig. l).To the west of the site
the low-lying central plain is visible, while to the north
and east the land forms part of the Dublin coastal plain.
From the excavation site the foothills of the Wicklow
Mountains, in particular Saggart Hill (395m OD) and
Verschoyles Hill (332m OD), are visible some 5?6km
to the south.The valley or pass between these two hills,
which leads south to Blessington, is also visible. A clus
ter of ring-barrows are located in this upland area in
the townlands of Lugmore, Crockaundreenagh, Lugg,

Crooksling and Mountseskin (Stout and Stout 1992,
12, 32). On the north-eastern side of Saggart Hill the
prehistoric enclosure and ring-barrow of Lugg, exca
vated in 1939, would be visible if it were not for the
extensive programme of afforestation undertaken there
in the latter half of the twentieth century (Kilbride
Jones 1950; RMP DU024-008).
In general, the land within the development zone is
low-lying, ranging from 68m to 70m above Ordnance
Datum. Until recently the land was used for agricul
tural purposes, which appear to have been largely arable
in nature. Approximately 0.3-0.5m of plough soil is
present in this area; the underlying natural subsoil con
sists of stony sandy clay with an underlying geology of
marrtly Carboniferous limestone, outcrops of shale,
dolomite and sandstone. The topography is generally

level at approximately 68m OD.The south-eastern cor
ner of the field in which the ring-barrow was discov
ered contained a naturally raised area measuring
approximately 60m east/west by 150m north/south.
This area was generally 2m higher than the surround
ing topography The ring-barrow was sited in this
slightly elevated position.
There is a growing body of evidence for prehistoric
settlement in this part of Dublin (Fig. 2).Afulacht fiadh
was excavated in the adjoining townland of Nangor, to
the south of Kilmahuddrick (Doyle 2002). In Kishoge
townland, to the north of Kilmahuddrick, a Neolithic
house was excavated in 2001 (O'Donovan 2003-4).
Several prehistoric features were also recorded during
monitoring operations in 1996-7 in Nangor and
Kilmahuddrick townlands (O'Brien 1998a; 1998b).

The name of the parish and townland in which the
ring-barrow was excavated, Kilmahuddrick, suggests an
ecclesiastical origin.The element Kit is an Anglicisation
of Cell (later CM), meaning a monastic cell but gener
ally signifying a church. This merges with
Mochuidbhricht to form 'the church of Mochuidbhricht'.
Mochuidbhricht derives from Mo 'my' and Cuidbhricht, an
Irish form of Cuthbert. St Cuthbert (c. 634-87) was an
Anglo-Saxon monk and bishop of Lindisfarne. After his
death his cult spread rapidly to the Irish church in
Britain and Ireland, possibly via Scotland, where it is
reflected in the placename Kircudbright.The use of the
possessive form (mo- 'my') points to an early importa
tion, probably before the eighth century (Mac
Shamhr?in 1996, 125, 142 .3). The parish church of
Kilmahuddrick (RMP DUO17-038) is located some
800m to the east of the ring-barrow.
There is also considerable evidence for medieval
settlement in the immediate area. A series of pits and
ditches spanning the early medieval and medieval peri
ods were revealed in Nangor townland during 2000
(Doyle 2002).The medieval ditch features appear to be
associated with Nangor Castle (RMP DUO 17-037),
just outside the southern boundary of the develop
ment. A fine late medieval tower-house with modern
domestic additions (RMP DUO 17-134) in Grange
townland is located immediately outside the western
boundary of the biotechnology campus.
Evidence for the medieval land-holding pattern in
Grange and Kilmahuddrick townlands is available.
From the twelfth century, the Cistercian abbey of St
Marys held lands in the Clondalkin area. St Marys

(founded c. 1139) was located on the north bank of the
River Liffey in the area of Dublin city now represent
ed by Capel Street and Abbey Street. It became a pow
erful and wealthy religious house, with extensive
land-holdings throughout Dublin and Ireland. The Cis
tercians of St Mary s Abbey fostered a cult of St Cuth
bert. A decree of the general chapter of 1256
mentioned him as one of the saints to be commemo
rated by the order. This may have been due to his asso
ciation with the name of the lands that had come into
their possession (Ronan 1940, 183; Doherty 2000,
187).
Details are available for lands held by St Mary's that
were referred to as Ballymacheilmer and Kilmacud
drick (now Kilmahuddrick). According to O
Conbhuidhe (1962, 51), the land of Ballymacheilmer
was held by the abbey before 1172, and possibly even
before the coming of the Anglo-Normans. Possession
of Ballymacheilmer was confirmed to the abbey by
King Henry II in two charters dated 1174 and 1179. A
confirmation of the lands, chapel and tithes was also
made by the archbishop of Dublin, John Comyn, in
1186 when Master Osbert of Clondalkin withdrew any
claim to the lands in Bafimacailmer. A marginal entry
in another confirmation by the same archbishop iden
tifies Ballymacheilmer with Kilmacoldrick, now referred
to as Kilmahuddrick.
THE EXCAVATION
Two areas were excavated. Area A concentrated on the
ring-barrow and surrounding features. Area was
located some 45m to the south-east of the ring-barrow
in a separate field. The excavations were licensed (ref
erence 00E0448) by D?chas (now Department of the
Environment, Heritage and Local Government).
Area A: The ring-barrow
Probably owing to intensive ploughing, no indication
of deliberate mound material or an old buried ground
surface or sod layer was noted at any stage of the
archaeological investigations within the interior of the
barrow.
Phase I. Pre-barrow features
A pit in the south-east of the area investigated is the
sole feature that can be ascribed to a pre-barrow phase
of activity. Two pits were identified but only one of
these is demonstrably earlier than the barrow. The
suggestion that pit F73 pre-dates the barrow is due to
its truncation by F3, the cut for the barrow ditch. Pit
F73 was flat-bottomed with sloping sides and extant
measurements of 2.3m north-east/south-west by
1.24m south-east/north-west. The main fill of this
feature, F41, was a moderately compact mid-brown
sandy clay with occasional small stones and charcoal
flecking. The pit and fills remain undated (Figs 3, 9 J).
Phase II. Early Bronze Age activity: the ring-bar
row ditch
The ring-barrow ditch was initially detected by geo
physical survey. Upon excavation the ditch cut, F3,
consisted of an uninterrupted circular ditch cutting
natural subsoil (Fig. 3). It had an external diameter of
12.2m north/south and 12.4m east/west.The ditch was
approximately 2.3-2.5m wide at the top, narrowing
inwards to approximately 0.25-0.3m wide at the base.
Its outer edge sloped at a consistent angle towards the
flat base. In contrast, the inner edge sloped at an angle
of approximately 45? before assuming a near-vertical
aspect towards the base. This profile was maintained
throughout the entire circumference of the ditch,
which was 1.6-1.7m deep from the level of natural
subsoil to the base.
Within F3, apart from the deposition of fills and
sediments, activity was evidenced by a group of stone
features. One of these was a small stone structure, and
fires had been lit on the upper surfaces of two separate

stone blocks. The activity involving the stone features
is early in the stratigraphie sequence of the ditch cut.
These features were all at the base of the ditch and do
not appear to have been inserted through later cuts. A
thin layer of yellow-greyish silty clay with inclusions of
small stones lay under or around stone features Fl8,
Fl6 and Fl5/28.This basal silt, Fl7, ran almost contin
uously around the base of the ring-barrow ditch and
was approximately 0.08-0.16m thick. Small fragments
of Quercus charcoal were identified from Fl7 and yield
ed a radiocarbon date of 2885?40 BP (GrA-17924,
1208-935 cal. BC at 2 sigma), which spans the middle
to later Bronze Age.
At the base of the western portion of the barrow
ditch a cluster of stones and patches of oxidised or fire
reddened clay were uncovered (Fig. 4). One such stone,
Fl5, was a large limestone block measuring 0.35m
east/west by 0.29m north/south by 0.19m deep. A
patch of oxidised clay and charcoal was present on its
flat upper surface and there was a patch of oxidised or
f?re-reddened clay on the natural clay of the adjacent
inner edge of F3, indicating in situ burning. Immedi
ately south of Fl 5 was a spread of charcoal and oxidised
clay, F30, which overlay the basal silt Fl7 and measured
0.3m north/south by 0.24m east/west by 0.03-0.04m
deep. Charcoal within F30 was identified as Fraxinus
and returned a radiocarbon date of 3790140 BP (GrA
17925,2398-2047 cal.BC at 2 sigma).This date, which
centres on the late Neolithic-early Bronze Age, is con
siderably earlier than that from F17.This may be due to
the analysis of old wood, yet equally it may reflect an
early Bronze Age date for the monument.
The southern edge of F30 was defined by a second
large limestone block, F28, with smooth flat sides and
upper surface and measuring 0.25m east/west by
0.18m north/south by 0.09m deep. Its south-facing
side was fire-reddened from in situ burning. Immedi
ately south of F28 was a spread of small to medium
sized stones, charcoal and burnt clay, F31, measuring
0.33m east/west by 0.14m north/south by 0.04m deep.

A further small patch of burnt clay, F32, was revealed
slightly north of Fl5. It measured 0.12m east/west by
0.1m north/south and was sealed by a thin layer of the
basal silt deposit Fl7.
In the north-western portion of the barrow ditch
stone Fl6 was uncovered, approximately 4.5m to the
north of Fl5 and F28. It was a large flat-sided lime
stone block, 0.45m east/west by 0.35m north/south by
0.35m deep, which sat directly on the base of the F3
cut into natural subsoil. Like Fl5, Fl6 displayed signs of
in situ burning, as evidenced by patches of fire
reddened clay and pieces of charcoal on its flat upper
surface, fire-reddening of the actual stone and of the
outer edge of F3.T? the south of Fl6 lay a deposit of
charcoal and several medium-sized stones, F27, meas
uring some 0.5m north/south by 0.3m east/west. A
small patch of charcoal was also noted on the northern
side of Fl 6.
It appears that stones Fl5, Fl6 and F28 were in situ
inclusions in the natural subsoil that were not removed
by the original diggers of the barrow ditch. The stones
were subsequently used as dry places where a fire could
be fit. During the archaeological excavation, after the
fills were excavated from F3, an attempt was made to
move stones Fl5 and Fl6. Both were found to run
partly beyond the edge of F3 and into natural subsoil.
Several other stone features were revealed at the
base of the northern area of the barrow ditch (PI. 2;
Figs 3, 4B).The most interesting of these was Fl8, a
small cist-like structure of inward-leaning stones
topped with a capstone. The side stones (two on the
eastern side and three on the western side) comprised
medium to large angular stones leaning inwards to an
apex at an angle of approximately 45? (the barrow ditch
cut F3 formed the northern and southern sides).The
long axes of all the side stones pointed downwards. Two
of the stones on the western side were heat-scorched to
a pinkish-red hue. However, this did not appear to rep
resent in situ burning and it seems that the stones were
fire-reddened prior to deposition. The capstone was an
irregularly shaped limestone block measuring 0.37m
east/west by 0.35m north/south by 0.12m deep. The
expected downward pressure of this capstone upon the
side stones led to the placing of a holding stone, meas
uring 0.24m north/south by 0.12m east/west, on the
eastern side of Fl 8.

Fl8 was dismantled to reveal F51, a small patch of
fire-reddened clay measuring 0.4m east/west by 0.25m
north/south by 0.02-0.03m thick, on the base of the
barrow ditch. However, no deposits of cremated bone
or any finds were revealed under or adjacent to Fl8. A
small charcoal stain, Fl9, revealed immediately to the
east of Fl8 was found to be within Fl7, the basal silt
fill.
A large limestone block, F21, was uncovered some
0.5m to the east of Fl 8. It was shaped almost like a seat,
measuring 0.43m in width and 0.8m in height. Its full
dimensions were not determined as it was found to
extend beyond the edge of the barrow ditch cut. It
would thus appear that this naturally occurring large
limestone boulder was uncovered by the original dig
gers of the barrow ditch, who split it, giving the boul
der its chair-like appearance.
Two further stone features were revealed at the base
of the northern area of the barrow ditch. F22, a medi
um-sized sub-angular limestone boulder, measured
0.3m east/west by 0.2m north/south by 0.4m high.
Some 0.2m east of F22 stood F23, a roughly hewn
limestone block placed on end at the base of the ditch.
It measured 0.44m east/west by 0.32m north/south
with a vertical height of 0.62m. No socket or cavity
was detected around its base. Although the possibility
was not considered at the time of excavation, it is plau
sible that the original diggers of the barrow ditch
removed F23 from the limestone block F21.
Fl7 and the stone features at the base of F3 were
sealed by F14, a thick (0.5-0.8m) deposit made up of
several lenses of greyish-brown silty clays. Towards the
centre of F3 there was a particular concentration of
small rounded pebbles and medium-sized stones, indi
cating a natural and gradual process of silting. It appears
from the section profiles that material was washed into
Fl4 from both sides of the ditch cut.
Fl4 was sealed by F8, a greyish-brown clay silt with
frequent inclusions of small to medium-sized rounded
and angular stones and occasional charcoal flecking. A
characteristic of this fill was the presence of fragments
of crushed mollusc shells, particularly at the base of the
deposit. F8 had a maximum depth of approximately
0.3m at the centre of the ditch; it was less thick at the
edges of the F3 cut and was found throughout the
entire circumference of the ditch.

Phase III. Later Bronze Age activity
F8 was overlain by one of the main upper fills in the
ditch, F7 (Fig. 5). This deposit of mid-dark brown silty
clay, 0.2-0.4m deep, with occasional small to medium
sized stones and occasional fragments of animal bone,
extended through the entire circumference of the ring
barrow ditch. Fragments of a human adult skull were
retrieved from this deposit on the western side of the
ditch. The skull had a weathered appearance and may
have been exposed prior to burial. One fragment was
dated by radiocarbon analysis to 2695?40 BP (GrA
18045, 911-802 cal. BC at 2 sigma) and thus can be
assigned to the later Bronze Age. No trace of a pit or
cut associated with its insertion into deposit F7 was
detected.
Directly above F7 and underneath F4 (one of the
uppermost fills) a small area of m situ burning, FI 1, was
noted in the north-eastern area of the barrow ditch. It
consisted of an upper spread of brown-grey clay with
frequent charcoal inclusions overlying a pinkish-red
oxidised clay area and measured 1.56m north/south by
0.9m east/west with a maximum depth of 0.1m. A
single cremated bone fragment was recovered from this
deposit.
The barrow interior: cremation features
The barrow ditch enclosed an area approximately 7.5m
in diameter (Pl. 1; Figs 3, 7), within which were
revealed what are described as cremation features.
These were initially visible as patches of softer, water
retentive soils, some with occasional flecks of cremated
bone. The earliest of these cremation features appears to
be cut F91, which was found at the centre of the bar
row and measured 1.3m north-east/south-west by
0.5m south-east/north-west by 0.8-0.9m deep. The
cut was irregularly shaped, with a sloping western side,
vertical southern and eastern sides, and the northern
edge undercut or sloping outwards (Figs 3,6 E?F).The
primary fill of this cut, F87, was a moderately compact
light brown clay with occasional small stone inclusions.
It contained a high concentration of cremated bone
pieces and charcoal fragments. The bone was efficient
ly cremated and had been crushed into small fragments,
which hindered identification. A sherd of what appears
to be early Bronze Age/late Neolithic pottery (Appen
dix I, 00E0448:5) and a small black glass bead
(00E0448:4) were retrieved from this fill. A sample of
cremated bone from F87 was dated by radiocarbon
analysis to 2745?40 BP (GrA-18015,992-822 cal. BC
at 2 sigma).
F87 was sealed by F84, a very compact grey clay
with frequent small stone inclusions which filled the
upper part of cut F91 and appeared to overlie it at the
top. This deposit measured 1.3m east/west by 1.2m
north/south by 0.15m deep, ranging to 0.7m deep in
Fig. 6?Sections of cremation features F77, F9 ? and F78.
the F91 cut. It appeared to be redeposited natural clay.
The assertion that F91/F87 is the earliest of the
cremation features is based on two separate stratigraph
ie relationships recorded during the excavation. The
deposit of compact redeposited natural clay F84 was
partly removed by cremation cut F78 to the east and by
cut F77 to the west.
F77, a shallow depression, was cut into natural sub
soil and also into F84 (Figs 3,7,6 F). It measured 1.5m
north/south by 0.8m east/west by 0.29m deep, with
gently sloping sides and a flat base. Its lower and main
fill was F39, a moderately compact dark brown sandy

clay with frequent inclusions of cremated bone frag
ments and small stones. This cremation appears to rep
resent the remains of a single individual. A sample of
the cremated bone was dated by radiocarbon analysis
to 2760?50 BP (GrA-18288, 1012-819 cal. BC at 2
sigma). F25, the upper fill of cut F77, was a dark
brownish-black sandy clay with frequent dense inclu
sions of cremated bone fragments, some in a weathered
or powdered state. This deposit measured 0.72m
north/south by 0.52m east/west by 0.1m deep.
The north-eastern cremation pit, F78, also appeared
to cut F84, even if only slightly. Before excavation, fill
F79 appeared as a slightly darker patch of moisture
retentive clay, without any visible flecks of charcoal or
cremated bone (Figs 3, 7, 6 G). Upon excavation F78
was revealed to be an elongated pit with sloping sides
on the north, east and south. Its western side had a
gentle slope at the top but broke into a steep-sided
slope halfway down. The base was rounded, giving an
almost 'V-section' appearance to the feature. The cut
measured 2.1m north/south by 1.2m east/west by
0.64m deep. Its fill, F79, was moderately compact mid
brownish grey clay with moderate inclusions of cre
mated bone and occasional inclusions of charcoal and
small stones.
On the basis of the radiocarbon dates from deposits
F87 and F39 it appears that the cremated remains date
from the later Bronze Age. The thorough crushing of
the cremated human bone is in accordance with funer
ary practices from the middle to later Bronze Age
(Appendix II). A limited range of macroscopic seed
remains were recovered from the cremation features,
although the charcoal identified from F39 included
elm, hazel, alder and ash.
Phase IV. Iron Age activity
The uppermost fills in the barrow ditch were F4 and
F5 (Figs 5, 7), which overlay F7. F4 was a dark brown
clay with frequent charcoal flecks. It was approximate
ly 0.9m wide with a typical depth of 0.17-0.2m, and
contained occasional pebbles and small stones and
occasional fragments of cremated bone. It was present
on the northern and western sides of the ditch fill but
its interface with F5 at the south-east was difficult to
discern. F5, which also overlay F7, was similar in com
position to F4?mid- to dark brown clay with occa

al pieces of heat-shattered stone. F5 was only detected
in the south-eastern area of the ring-barrow. While
both F4 and F5 contained occasional flecks of cremat
ed bone, no discrete clusters of cremated material or
burials were noted. A sample of cremated human bone
from F5 was dated by radiocarbon analysis to 2175?40
BP (GrA-18014, 373-111 cal. BC at 2 sigma).
Two areas of oxidised clay were noted on the sur
face of F4. At the west of the barrow ditch was F6, a
patch of fire-reddened clay measuring 0.95m east/west
by 0.85m north/south with a maximum thickness of
0.07m. Adjoining this at the south-west was a small
patch of charcoal, 0.3m east/west by 0.45m
north/south. A second area of burning on the surface
of F4 was noted in the northern area of the ditch fill.
This was F9, a small patch of charcoal, 0.28m east/west
by 0.25m north/south by 0.06m deep.
Additional activity, which can be dated to the Iron
Age, includes F69, a deposit of cremated and non
cremated bone that was disturbed by the digging of the
linear field boundary F34 to the south of the ring
barrow. Deposit F69, 0.98m north/south by 0.35m
east/west by 0.05m deep, was a moderately compact
dark brown charcoal-flecked sandy clay with occasional
small fragments of burnt and unburnt bone. A single
fragment of a heat-cracked amber bead (00E0448:3)
was retrieved during sieving. The non-cremated
material and most of the cremated material from F69
was animal bone, but a few fragments of human bone
were also present. A sample of the cremated human
bone was dated by radiocarbon analysis to 2230?50 BP
(GrA-18160, 393-192 cal. BC at 2 sigma).
Some 0.8m to the south of F69 a similar deposit
was revealed. F70 consisted of a moderately compact
dark brown charcoal-flecked sandy clay with occasion
al small fragments of burnt bone. It measured 0.86m
north/south by 0.44m east/west by 0.06m deep, and it
too appeared to have been disturbed by F34.
Phase V. Early medieval field system
A series of linear features were found on the western and
southern sides of the ring-barrow (PI. 3; Fig. 8). Trench
B, opened in an adjoining field to the east of the ring
barrow, detected a continuation of these features. Taken
as a whole, the evidence suggests that the barrow was
enclosed in what appears to be a coaxial field system, as
represented by the linear features F26, F34 and F88, as
well as Fl 17 from Area B.A radiocarbon date from strat
ified animal bone indicates that this complex can be
assigned to the early medieval period.
In Area A, linear feature F26 consisted of an
east/west-aligned shallow cut into natural subsoil (Fig.
8). It was found some 3.6m west of the ring-barrow
ditch and extended westward for a length of 41m. It
had sloping sides with a rounded, concave base and was
0.8-1 m wide. Its depth varied, ranging from 0.29m at
the east to approximately 0.12m at the west. The fill,
F12, was consistent throughout, made up of a moder
ately compact mid-brown clay with moderate inclu
sions of small stones and occasional charcoal flecking.
A small spur-like projection excavated on the northern
side of F26 had the same fill, i.e. F12.This projection
measured 2.3m south-east/north-west and was 1.2m
wide, narrowing to 0.2m to the north. While F26 was
approximately 41m long, its orientation changed mid
way. Its eastern half was orientated east/west, but its
western half turned slightly to run south-west/north
east. The eastern termination of F26 was 2.5m west of
a second linear feature, F34.
F34, running on a north/south axis, was exposed
for a length of 36.5m immediately west of the ring
barrow ditch F3. It was a shallow, steep-sided cut into
natural subsoil with a rounded base and ranged in
width from 0.4m to 1.1m, being narrowest at the
southern termination. Its fill, F29, was a moderately
compact light brown clay containing occasional small
to medium-sized stones, occasional flecks of charcoal
and pieces of animal bone. A sample of this animal
bone was dated by radiocarbon analysis to 1060?50 BP
(GrN-26321, cal. AD 877-1147 at 2 sigma). Accord
ingly, it can be argued that the field system represented
by these linear features can be dated to the early
medieval period.
A distance of approximately 0.2m separated the
eastern edge of cut F34 from the western edge of F3,
the ring-barrow ditch cut. There was a slight kink in
F34 to the north of where it skirted F3.This suggests
that the barrow was an upstanding visible feature in the
landscape and that the diggers of the linear feature
made an effort to avoid it. At this point F34 cut an
earlier feature, F45, a compact mid-brown sandy clay
deposit measuring 1.3m north/south by 0.7m
east/west by 0.2m deep.
Some 4.5m to the south of the terminus of F34 an
east/west-orientated linear feature, F88, was revealed,
running for approximately 30m at a right angle to F29.
It was an irregularly shaped cut into natural subsoil
running predominantly on an east/west axis, with a
spur-like projection to the north, in the direction of
F34, midway along its length.The projection measured
approximately 4m north/south. At this point F88
changed direction slightly, to run south-west/north
east for 6m. Its western portion resumed an east-west
alignment, terminating in a rounded point.The sides of
F88 sloped to meet a rounded, sometimes uneven base.
It was around 0.25m deep, with the depth increasing
towards the centre of the cut to 0.45m. It was filled
with F89, a homogeneous moderately compact light
brown clay with frequent inclusions of small stones and
occasional charcoal flecks.

associated with the ring-barrow.
Miscellaneous features
Possible post-holes
Several features that cannot be linked into a wider
stratigraphie sequence were excavated next to the ring
barrow. A geological feature, F50, a seam of orange
brown heavy clay, ran for a length of approximately
25m north-west/south-east and was cut by F76, a
modern engineering test pit. The exposed section face
provided by F76 showed F50 to be 1.1m deep and
reaching to bedrock. Two modern agricultural features
that may have been the result of ploughing, F74 and
F75, cut across F50 in this area. F50 was also cut by the
ring-barrow ditch F3.
A cluster of possible post-holes, F55, F56, F57 and
F59, were revealed adjacent to F50 as darker, moisture
retentive patches within the natural subsoil. No archae
ological material was recovered from any of the
suggested post-holes and they remain suspicious as
archaeological features.
A concentration of similar features?F42, F43, F44
and F47, shallow depressions into natural subsoil?was
revealed in the eastern part of the barrow interior.
Pits
Several pits were excavated close to the ring-barrow.
No stratigraphie link is apparent between any of these
isolated features and the ring-barrow.
Pit F64 was located outside the south-eastern edge
of the ring-barrow ditch cut (Figs 7, 9 -K). It had
sloping sides and a rounded base, and measured 3.65m
north-east/south-west by 0.75m north-west/south
east. The lower fill, F68, consisted of dark greyish
brown stony clay slumped against the western edge of
the cut. This had a maximum vertical thickness of
approximately 0.44m. The main fill of pit F64 was F63,
a compact grey-yellow clay, approximately 0.3-0.35m
deep, with occasional inclusions of small stones. F63
was sealed by F62, a moderately compact grey clay with
occasional flecks of oxidised clay, which measured
0.43m north/south by 0.34m east/west by 0.07m deep.
The upper fill was F37, a moderately compact light
greyish yellow stony clay, 0.46m thick, with occasional
patches of oxidised clay throughout.
F37 was cut by a small pit, F60, containing oxidised
clay and charcoal flecks and measuring 0.61m

north/south by 0.5m east/west by 0.32m deep.This did
not appear to be in situ burning. A second small patch
of oxidised clay, F38, measuring 0.2m north/south by
0.18m east/west by 0.03-0.04m deep, was noted to the
east of F60.
F58, a small subcircular pit measuring 0.47m
north/south by 0.39m east/west by 0.25m deep, was
uncovered to the north-west of the ring-barrow, 5.5m
from the outer edge of F3. Its fill consisted of a loose
ly compact mid-brown sandy clay containing fibrous
root matter and occasional small stones. The pit had
vertical sides and a rounded base. A small stone object
(00E448:7) with a central depression was recovered
from this pit.
A second pit, F83, was excavated some 4.2m from
the western edge of F3. It was sub-oval in shape, with
a gradually sloping western edge, a vertical eastern edge
and a flat base. It measured 2.48m north-west/south
east by 1.22m north-east/south-west by 0.6m deep and
contained two fills. The upper fill, F86, was a moder
ately compact yellow-brown sandy clay with occasion
al inclusions of small stones and flecks of charcoal and
a maximum depth of 0.42m. The lower fill, F86, was a
moderately compact reddish brown clay with occa
sional inclusions of small stone and charcoal flecks and
a maximum depth of 0.21m.
To the south-west of the ring-barrow, at a distance
of 9.5m from the barrow ditch, a modern feature, F90,
was excavated. It was a narrow linear feature that ran
into the western baulk. A small sherd of weathered
medieval pottery and a clay pipe fragment (00E448:1
and 2 respectively) were recovered from its fill, F71.
Area
This area lay approximately 45m to the south-east of
the ring-barrow (Figs 2, 10). During the pre-excava
tion archaeological assessment a metalled surface and
two charcoal spreads were revealed.
In September 2000, to follow up on the results of
the archaeological assessment, a larger trench, referred
to as Area B, was opened. It was irregular in shape and
approximately 40m long. The main discovery in the
Area trench was a continuation of the field bound
ary system as initially revealed in Area A to the west. A
series of metalled surfaces and several post-holes were
also excavated.
A linear field boundary cut, Fl 17, which appears to
be a continuation of the phase IV field boundary sys
tem encountered in Area A, was uncovered (Figs 10,11)
and was traced for a distance of 11m east/west. In the
western part of the trench it extended to the north.

thus had a northern length of 19.2m as exposed.

a cut with sloping sides and a flat base, varying in depth
from 0.4m to 0.6m. It was filled with F105, a homo
geneous, moderately compact light brown sandy clay
with occasional small stones and charcoal flecks.
A cluster of cut features and a hearth were revealed
to the south of Fl 17. The hearth, F102, consisted of a
thin lower spread of charcoal, approximately 0.01m
deep, covered by a patch of oxidised fire-reddened clay.
It measured 1.17m east/west by 0.58m north/south by
0.08m deep. A shallow spread of charcoal and fire
reddened clay, no more than 0.05m thick, extended out
to the west of this feature for 1.1m north/south by
0.8m east/west. A cluster of four post-holes, Fl 15,
Fl 12, Fl 13 and Fl 14, lay approximately 4m to the
south of Fl 02.
A linear feature, Fl 16, was excavated 2m to the
south of the hearth and was traced for a length of
4.51m before becoming difficult to detect. It consisted
of a steep-sided gulley with a rounded base, running
east/west. It was 0.21m deep and was filled with a light
orange-yellow clay with frequent pieces of decayed
stone and occasional flecks of charcoal. It appeared to
turn in a northerly direction at its western end, but it
became difficult to detect at this point. No finds were
recovered from this feature.

DISCUSSION
The ring-barrow site type is characterised by the pres
ence of a 'low, artificial central mound' (Newman 1997,
155), with or without a circular ditch from which the
central mound was created. An outer bank is also a
North-facing section through Fl 17.

feature of certain barrow types. In a review of Irish
archaeological literature for this monument type New
man sought to redefine the nomenclature used to
describe circular prehistoric burial monuments. It was
suggested that the absence of a mound or raised area
composed of redeposited material warranted the use of
the term ring-ditch, whereas if an outer earthen bank
was present the term 'embanked ring-ditch' was appro
priate (ibid., 153-60).
Such a system poses problems for field survey and
for excavation. The Kilmahuddrick monument was
extensively ploughed in antiquity and no trace of the
monument was indicated on the Ordnance Survey
mapping, dating from the mid-nineteenth century. A
small test trench excavated through the centre of the
monument during the assessment phase failed to detect
any significant difference between the plough soil and
any potential central mound remnant. However, the
term ring-barrow is preferred and employed for the
Kilmahuddrick monument on two grounds. Firstly, the
sheer size of the ditch cut F3 is important. The ring

barrow ditch had an external diameter of 12.2m
north/south and 12.4m east/west, a width of approxi
mately 2.3-2.5m at the top, narrowing inwards to
approximately 0.25?0.3m wide at the base, and a depth
of 1.6-1.7m below the level of natural subsoil.The cre
ation of such a ditch required the removal of a sub
stantial quantity of spoil, making the deposition of
some of this in the centre of the area enclosed by the
ditch quite likely.
Furthermore, examination of the sections recorded
through the ditch fills indicates silting and slumping
from the inner and outer sides of F3.The ditch fill F14,
in particular, appears to be the result of natural slump
ing or infilling from both sides of the ditch. There is
thus a case for arguing for a central mound of re
deposited material that would originally have been
excavated from the ditch. It is also possible that there
was a similarly composed small bank outside the F3
ditch.
Chronology and stratigraphy
The dating of the sequence of activity is largely based
on radiocarbon dates and stratigraphie relationships
owing to the absence of diagnostic artefacts. Some
eight radiocarbon dates were obtained from the ditch
fills and from cremated bone samples. What is immedi
ately obvious from examination of the dates is the rel
atively early nature of the sample from the in situ
burning F30 at the base of the barrow ditch (Fig. 3).
This date of 3790?40 BP (GrA-17925,2398-2047 cal.
BC) from ash tree charcoal falls at the very earliest
stages of the Bronze Age and is within Brindley's so
called Introductory Phase of the Bronze Age (Brindley
1995).With reference to Kilmahuddrick, this date from
F30 is almost a millennium earlier than the main body
of dates from the site. An unclear impression of the ear
liest activity arises when the date from F17, the layer of
basal silting in the barrow ditch, is considered. Small
flecks of oak charcoal from Fl7 dated through the
AMS method produced date GrA-17924 of 2885?40
BP (1208-935 BC).While the potential for movement
of such small charcoal flecks into Fl 7 needs to be con
sidered, the date from the charcoal of the in situ burn
ing F30 still appears to be relatively early in comparison
with the rest of the activity on the site. It is notewor
thy that no diagnostic cultural material from the early
Bronze Age was recovered on site and moreover the
character and dating of the cremations also appear to be
later. In the light of this it is plausible that the early
Bronze Age date from F30 may represent old wood.
Alternatively, the later Bronze Age cremations may rep
resent the reuse of an earlier monument.
The presence of the stone features at the base of the
ring-barrow ditch F3 is of some interest. The oxidised
clay on the surfaces and immediately surrounding the
large limestone blocks Fl5 and Fl6 was clearly the
result of in situ burning (Figs 3, 4 C-D). While the
background to this, i.e. either ritual or domestic, is
unclear, it is obvious that it took place relatively early
in the sequence of activity in the ditch. Episodes of
burning in barrow ditches are known from elsewhere
in the archaeological record. Fires were lit in the ditch
of Tumulus 6 at the barrow cemetery of Carrowjames
II, Co. Mayo, when the ditch was half-full of silt
(Raftery 1940-1, 26-7, fig. 7). Tumulus 7 at Carrow
james II also possessed evidence for burning in the
fosse, which similarly took place when the ditch was
half-silted (ibid., 27).What are described as 'large blocks
of limestone' that had been pushed into the ditch silt
were also present in the ditch of Tumulus 7 (ibid.).
Unlike Kilmahuddrick, none of the fires or stones from
the barrows at Carrowjames II were stratigraphically
early in the sequence of ditch silting or filling. Both
Tumuli 6 and 7 at Carrowjames II were seen by the
excavator as the earliest in the cemetery (ibid., 49). Both
barrows could date from the early Bronze Age and
morphologically both can be classed as bowl-barrows
(Waddell 1990,115; Newman 1997,166-7).Both con
tained unaccompanied cremations.
The Kilmahuddrick 'cist-like' structure, Fl8, which
was found at the base of the northern portion of the
barrow ditch, is quite unusual. It was constructed of
inward-leaning large stones, topped with a central
stone (PL 2; Figs 3-4B).When dismantled, it was found
to be empty. A small patch of oxidised clay was found
under the stones. Like Fl6 and Fl5, Fl8 appears to be
quite early in the sequence of activity in the barrow
ditch. Although it is not typical of cist structures from
the prehistoric period, the lack of cultural material
within it can be paralleled. The excavation of a cairn at
Moneen, Co. Cork, revealed a circular ditch dating
from the late Neolithic period that was associated with
several cists. One of these, cist no. 3, was found to be
empty but was not, however, similar in construction to
the Kilmahuddrick example (O'Kelly 1952).
Layers of sterile in-washed material, F24 and F14,
accumulated over the stone features at the base of the
Kilmahuddrick barrow ditch. These layers appear to
represent natural silting, possibly from erosion of the
sides of the ditch cut or potentially from an associated
mound or bank (Fig. 5). The layer above this, F8, was
also a layer of silts containing occasional fragments of
animal bone, but the presence of lenses of mollusc
shells may indicate standing water or waterlogging of
the ditch for part of the year. One of the upper ditch
fills, F7, a mid-dark brown silty clay, produced a date in
the later Bronze Age, 2695?40 BP (GrA-18045,
911-802 cal. BC), derived from a fragment of human
skull. What is striking about this is that while the
dating of the skull portion is broadly contemporary

with the two radiocarbon dates from the cremations at
the centre of the barrow (F39 and F87), over lm of silt
had accumulated in the barrow ditch by this time. This
raises the question as to whether or not the dated cen
tral cremations F87 and F39 were primary, and it would
suggest that the early Bronze Age radiocarbon date
from F30 at the base of the ditch may be less influenced
by any old wood effect. In such a scenario the two
dated cremations F87 and F39, as well as cremation
F79, which was not dated, may be considerably later in
date than the actual barrow ditch and the initial activ
ity represented therein by F30. Ritual activity in such
a sequence would include the f?res F30 and F31 as well
as the stone cist structure Fl8. In this case, given the
absence of any dated burial from the period, the possi
bility of a cenotaph function could be considered. As
such, the creation of a barrow ditch and the raising of
a mound could be seen as an act of commemoration
that need not have required the placing of human
remains therein (Woodward 2000, 49-50). In the Irish
archaeological context, the lack of human remains in
the barrows of MitchelstowndownWest, Co. Limerick,
prompted Daly and Grogan to propose a similar argu
ment (1993). The vast majority of barrows in this area
of Limerick would normally be accepted as middle
Bronze Age in date (Cooney and Grogan 1999, 30-1).
The upper layers of the barrow ditch consisted of
F4 and F5 (Figs 5, 7). Neither layer contained concen
trations of cremated bone but occasional flecks were
mixed through both deposits. Some small fragments of
cremated human bone from F5 were radiocarbon
dated. Date GrA-18014 of 2175?40 BP (373-111 cal.
BC) indicates early Iron Age activity. The lack of dis
crete deposits of cremated bone may suggest that the
deposits derive from disturbed contexts, perhaps from
the levelling of a central mound containing cremated
material. It is noteworthy that F5, a fill on the southern
side of the barrow ditch, contained occasional frag
ments of heat-shattered stone reminiscent of the ma
terial associated with fulachta fiadh. Significantly, a
trough from a fulacht fiadh was excavated some 200m
to the south of the barrow (Doyle 2002, 74-5), and it
is possible that debris from this fulacht fiadh was incor
porated into the fill of the ring-barrow ditch. Alterna
tively, this heat-shattered stone may be associated with
domestic activity in the vicinity. Such domestic activi
ty can be inferred from animal bone recovered from
upper ditch fills, which was of low meat value and
much of which had been split to extract marrow. The
deposition of such refuse in what could be considered
a sacred space may have formed part of ritual practice.
Human remains
Analysis of two of the central cremation deposits has
indicated later Bronze Age dates. Cremation deposit
F87, at the centre of the barrow interior, sat within pit
F91 (Fig. 3), an irregularly shaped cut into natural sub
soil with undercut edges and oddly sloping sides. The
bone from this deposit was highly comminuted, with
over 80% of the sample crushed to less than 10mm in
size. It had been efficiently cremated, and fragments of
human skull, leg, pelvis, rib and vertebrae were identi
fied. A juvenile may have been present in this crema
tion (Appendix II).A small sherd of pottery (00E448:5)
retrieved from this cremation appears to represent an
element of a Beaker or Food Vessel (Appendix I) and
would accordingly be assigned to the later Neolithic or
early Bronze Age (Fig. 13). However, radiocarbon
dating places cremation F87 in the later Bronze Age.
Date GrA-18015 of2745?40 BP calibrates to 992-822
BC. An intact glass bead was also recovered from this
cremation (00E448:4). The bead, which is heat-blis
tered and discoloured to black, may originally have
been yellow (Fig. 13). It is comparable to Guido s Class
8, of which several examples have been identified in
Ireland at sites such as at Loughey, Co. Down, and
Ferns, Co. Wexford. At both of these sites, and indeed
from the wider British evidence cited by Guido, these
beads appear to date primarily from the early Iron Age,
specifically the third to first century BC (Guido 1978,
75; J. Carroll, pers. comm.). It is worth noting, how
ever, that glass beads have been recovered from possible
later Bronze Age contexts at Haughey's Fort, Co.
Armagh, and at Rathgall, Co.Wicklow (Mallory 1995,
81; B. Raftery 1987).
F77 contained the fills F25 and F39 (Figs 3,7).This
cremation feature was immediately obvious during the
early stages of the excavation and consisted of a com
paratively shallow cut into natural subsoil that was filled
with cremated bone fragments. It was stratigraphically
later than cremation feature F91/F87. Given the rela
tively shallow nature of F77, it is possible that it was
inserted through a mound, which was later removed.
Analysis of the human remains from this cremation
found little difference between fills F25 and F39 and it
was suggested that one individual was represented in
both deposits. The cremation cut F78 was an oblong
cut into natural subsoil with inward-sloping sides.
Unfortunately the bulk sample from this context was
destroyed during a break-in and fire at the site accom
modation during the excavation.
The manner in which the human remains were
deposited differed in the case of each cremation
feature. This lack of uniformity may indicate some
element of social meaning, given the varying treatment
of the cremated material. It is interesting, however, that
deposit F87 was capped with a layer of redeposited nat

ural subsoil, F84, which effectively sealed the crema
tion. No such sealing layer was noted for any of the
other cremation fills. The cremation pits F77 and F78
cut this sealing layer. In general the human remains
from Kilmahuddrick are in keeping with the charac
teristics of known later Bronze Age cremations in Ire
land. During the middle and later Bronze Age there is
a move towards unaccompanied cremations, often
characterised by the highly crushed or comminuted
nature of the bone deposit. Such deposits are frequent
ly described as token as only a portion of the cremat
ed skeletal remains are placed in the grave. The
Kilmahuddrick deposits are typical of such practices as
approximately 800g of bone were recovered from F39
and F25 and some 200g from F87. Typically some
1,600-3,OOOg would be expected from a full adult cre
mation (Appendix II). The presence of a sherd of pot
tery from F87 is not unusual as the placing of sherds of
pottery in such deposits is a known practice (Cooney
and Grogan 1999,135).This change in burial practices
from the middle Bronze Age onwards, such as the
absence of grave-goods, the demise of urn burials and
the token and comminuted nature of the bone deposit,
has been commented upon by several writers (ibid.,
135-6; Waddell 1998, 161). The recovery of a propor
tional grave deposit can be seen as the most archaeo
logically visible component of a funerary practice that
involves the preparation of a body, its cremation, the
collection of the cremated remains, the crushing and
comminuting of the deposit, and potentially the sepa
ration of the deposit into a portion for burial and
another portion for other, little-understood purposes.
Attempts have been made to link the deposition of
token cremated remains with the placing of sherds of
pottery representing part of a ceramic vessel in the
grave (Cooney and Grogan 1999,136).
The recovery of part of a human skull from the
upper fill, F7, of the ring-barrow ditch is significant.
The ritual deposition of a portion of a human skull can
be paralleled in a range of later prehistoric sites in Ire
land (Appendix II; Cooney and Grogan 1999, 146-8,
230-1; Murray 1992; Newman 1997, 240). The
Kilmahuddrick skull remains comprise 21 fragments
from the back of a human adult skull. The skull
appeared quite weathered and may have been curated
or exposed prior to its incorporation in ditch fill F7. A
fragment of the skull was dated in Groningen and
returned a date of 2695?40 BP (GrA-18045, 911-802
cal. BQ.This is broadly contemporary with the dates
from the central cremations F87 and F39, yet, as the
skull fragments were dated rather than the deposit, the
radiocarbon result may not give an entirely accurate
date for the deposit. It is likely that the ditch fills were
subject to waterlogging during parts of the year, as evi
denced by the sequence of fills and the presence of
mollusc shells. This is of note given the wet locations
for several later prehistoric human cranial fragments
and the general significance of such contexts through
out later prehistory (Cooney and Grogan 1999,146?8).
Further fragments of cremated bone were retrieved
in small quantities from the upper ditch fills (F4, F5, F6,
F7, F8, Fll), yet there was no clustering of such cre
mated material as to indicate discrete individual buri
als. The impression formed from this pattern is that
such small quantities may represent disturbance from
elsewhere. However, the charcoal-rich features F6, F9
and Fll appear to represent in situ burning activity.
Enclosing field system
The ring-barrow was enclosed within a series of shal
low linear cut features (PL 3; Fig. 8).These, it is argued,
represent the backfilled remains of a field system. F26
ran east/west, F34 ran north/south, and F88 and Fl 17
both ran east/west. Taken as a whole, this field system
appears to be coaxial, with the ring-barrow enclosed
within. The field to the south-west of the ring-barrow
would accordingly measure approximately 41m
east/west by 36.5m north/south. The depth of these
linear cuts as excavated appears quite shallow, varying
from 0.2m to 0.4m. Nonetheless, when the true depth
of a cut through topsoil and the possibility of a bank
formed from the upcast are allowed for, such features
could have performed adequately as boundaries.
Indeed, such bank and trench field boundaries are
described in an early medieval law-text on farming
(Kelly 2000,372-3).The use of suitable hedgerow-type
species could increase effectiveness as a boundary, and
small amounts of charcoal from potential hedgerow
species, such as cherry, apple and sloe, were found in fill
F105 of cut Fl 17 in Area B. This indicates that such
species were growing at the time the feature was back
filled.
The impression gleaned from the excavated evi
dence is that the linear features post-date the construc
tion of the ring-barrow. This impression was informed
during the excavation by the presence of a kink in cut
F34 at the point where it skirted past the barrow. A
sample of animal bone from fill F29 of cut F34 was
dated in Groningen to 1060?50 BP (GrN-26321, cal.
AD 877-1147), suggesting that the fill of this particu
lar feature accumulated during the pre-Norman peri
od. A small piece of iron (00E448:6) from fill F29 also
suggests the possibility of a date later than the ring
barrow. It remains an assumption that these field system
remnants are contemporary with each other, yet given
the symmetrical arrangement of the linear features this
would appear likely.
It remains speculative as to whether such fields were
intended for pastoral or arable farming, or a mixture of
both. While it is tempting to consider the subdivision

Excavation of a prehistoric ring-barrow at Kilmahuddrick, Clondalkin, Dublin 63
of land into fields as a consequence of the need for
agricultural surpluses to feed nearby urban settlements
such as Clondalkin or even Dublin, it is equally in
triguing to wonder why such a field system was
removed from the landscape. It is tempting, but specu
lative, to associate the removal of this field system, if not
the ring-barrow, with the arrival of the Cistercians dur
ing the twelfth century.
Two small cremations, F70 and F69, were found sit
ting over fill F29 of field boundary F34. Deposit F69
consisted of cremated and non-cremated human and
animal bone. A fragment of a small heat-cracked amber
bead (00E448:3) was recovered from this deposit dur
ing sieving (Fig. 13). Cremation F69 was radiocarbon
dated to 2230?50 BP (GrA-18160, 393-192 cal. BC),
somewhat earlier than the date derived from animal
bone within F29.The mixed nature of the F69 crema
tion may partly account for this as it may have been
redeposited during the backfilling of field boundary
F34.
The landscape context
The lowland area of south Dublin is extremely likely to
have been extensively settled during the prehistoric
period. There is a cluster of ring-barrows in the upland
areas to the south of Saggart village, specifically in the
townlands of Lugmore, Crockaundreenagh, Lugg,
Crooksling and Mountseskin (Stout and Stout 1992,
12, 32), some 6km to the south of the Kilmahuddrick
example (Fig. 12). It remains unclear whether the
Kilmahuddrick barrow is an outlying element of this
upland cluster. Archaeological sites are more likely to
survive on the less productive agricultural land in such
an upland area. Low-lying areas, like Kilmahuddrick
and Nangor townlands, are more likely to have under
gone a greater intensity of agricultural activity, result
ing in the removal of above-ground archaeological
remains. On the north-eastern side of Saggart Hill the
prehistoric site in Lugg townland, excavated in 1939,
would be visible from Kilmahuddrick were it were not
for the extensive programme of afforestation under
taken there in the latter half of the twentieth century
(Kilbride-Jones 1950; RMP DU024-008). This site
consisted of a circular bank and ditch enclosing numer
ous post-holes, an area of habitation and a low central
mound. Two pits containing cremations were found
under the central mound. Given that the mound
appeared to derive from a ditch, it is possible to con
sider this central element of the Lugg complex as a
ring-barrow, and indeed the excavator himself referred
to it as a barrow (Kilbride-Jones 1950, 330-1). From
examination of the sections in the published report it
is also possible to discern the remains of an external
bank around the barrow ditch (ibid.,p\. XXXIII). Exca
vation of the central mound or barrow at Lugg revealed
cremated human bone and what appear to be sherds of
later Bronze Age pottery, although at the time they
were described as being of Iron Age date (ibid., 324-6,
fig. 2.2, pl. XXVII; B. Raftery 1995,150; Gibson 1995,
87).The mound at Lugg also sealed a fireplace, and this,
with the array of pits and surfaces, suggests that the site
at Lugg had a complex history prior to the raising of
the central barrow mound.
While the greater body of evidence from the
Kilmahuddrick excavations suggests activity during the
later Bronze Age, the possibility of initial activity
dating from the early Bronze Age is represented by the
radiocarbon date from F30 at the base of the barrow
ditch. This would appear to be quite early for a ring
barrow in an Irish context, yet it can be argued that rel
atively few of these monuments have been excavated
to date in Ireland. However, comparisons with ring
ditches of so-called cenotaph function in Ireland, such
as those of the Morningstar Valley in County Limerick,
show chronological differences. Looking further afield,
the Buckskin II barrow in Hampshire, England, offers
an interesting parallel. A cenotaph function has been
suggested for this barrow as no central cremation was
associated with the act of barrow creation in phase four
(i.e. the excavation of the barrow ditch and creation of
a central mound). Secondary cremations were placed in
the barrow during the later Bronze Age and Iron Age
(phase six) (Allen et al. 1995).
The presence of the barrow at Kilmahuddrick and,
indeed, those in the wider area to the south indicate
considerable Bronze Age activity. Such ring-barrows
provide archaeological evidence for social and ritual
patterns during the Bronze Age in the area. It is of
interest that the prevailing burial tradition of the later
Bronze Age, generally cremation in simple pits, mili
tates against the discovery and reporting of large num
bers of burials from this period. It is only comparatively
recently that new techniques of examining and dating
cremated human remains have highlighted the scale of
ritual activity for this period. In contrast, the prevailing
ritual of the earlier Bronze Age, with a focus on inhu
mation and accompanied cremation, is more visible and
therefore more likely to be reported. It is perhaps only
in recent years that a more complete picture of burial
in the later Bronze Age has become apparent. To some
extent this is due to large-scale open-area excavations,
where large swathes of the landscape have been
stripped and where small cremations are more likely to
be recognised.
The evidence of metalwork has traditionally dom
inated the archaeological impression of the later Bronze
Age in Ireland. Metalwork from this period conveys an
impression of social ?lites, with a focus on weaponry,
and the ritual deposition of such metalwork, frequent
ly in wet contexts. From excavations such as Kilmahud

drick we can perhaps detect an emerging theme of a
funerary archaeology in the later Bronze Age landscape.

APPENDIX II
ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN BONE FROM
KILMAHUDDRICK
Laureen Buckley
Introduction
An excavation was carried out in advance of develop
ment in Kilmahuddrick townland between July and
September 2000. The main archaeological feature of
the site was a ring-barrow surrounded by a probable
field system. Some samples of cremated bone were
recovered from the upper layers of the barrow fill and
three separate cremation pits were found in the interi
or of the barrow. The samples were processed and the
recovered bone was sent to the osteoarchaeologist for
analysis.4
Methods
Examination of cremated remains involves a descrip
tion of colour and texture of the bone as this helps to
determine the efficiency of the cremation. Efficiently
cremated bone is white and usually has a chalky tex
ture. Less well cremated bone, where the temperature
of the pyre was not high enough or where oxygen flow
was restricted, has a blue or blue/black colour. The
bone fragments are then graded by size in order to
determine the degree of fragmentation. Although frag
mentation of the bone occurs continuously after dep
osition owing to compression pressures and also during
the disturbance of excavation and processing, it is still
possible to assess whether or not the bones were delib
erately crushed as part of the cremation ritual. A high
proportion of relatively large fragments would suggest
that the bones were not deliberately crushed after the
cremation whereas a small deposit of relatively small
fragments would indicate a ritually crushed token
deposit.
Each fragment of bone is then examined and iden
tified if possible. The degree of identification of frag
ments is generally dependent on fragment size. Larger
fragments are usually easier to identify although pha
langes are often found intact among the smaller frag
ments. Successful identification depends on the number
of distinguishing features present on the bone frag
ments as well as knowledge of the thickness and
expected cross-section of particular bones. Bones
shrink and warp during the cremation process and
sometimes it is not possible to specifically identify long
bone fragments.
The number of a specific skeletal element can then
determine the minimum number of individuals pres
ent. It is possible to distinguish juveniles from adults by
the thickness of the bone fragments, the presence or

absence of unfused epiphyses and the fragmentation of
the teeth. Adult teeth crowns tend to shatter during the
cremation process but unerupted juvenile teeth tend to
survive intact as the jawbones protect them. It is usual
ly possible to age juveniles if enough teeth are present.
Results
A total of seventeen samples were examined. Ten of the
samples were recovered from the upper fill of the bar
row ditch. Most of these were very small, weighing
only a few grammes or less. The samples from F4, the
uppermost layer in the ditch, contained fragments of
very decayed and weathered non-cremated bone as
well as some cremated cattle teeth and animal verte
brae. There was also some cremated human bone in this
sample but it was highly crushed and difficult to iden
tify.
The largest sample from the barrow fill was from
layer F5. Its total weight was 27g but this included a
cremated cow's tooth weighing 5g. The remainder of
the sample was highly crushed but it did contain some
animal bone as well as human skull and long bone frag
ments. A small burnt area, F6, which lay in F4, the
uppermost layer of barrow fill, contained a small
amount of highly crushed cremated bone from which
it was possible to identify a fragment of human femur
and a fragment of skull. There was also a small area of
burning, Fll,directly under F4, which contained a few
tiny fragments of cremated bone that could not be
identified.
Layer F7, which lay under F4, contained cremated
and non-cremated bone. The cremated samples were
very small and highly crushed and could not be iden
tified. The non-cremated bone had a very weathered
appearance as if it had been exposed to the elements
for some time before burial. One of the non-cremated
samples consisted of 21 fragments from the back of a
single human adult skull. This included large portions
of occipital and parietal bone with the lamboid and
sagittal sutures visible. There are similarities between
this skull and the partial skull found at Raffln Fort, Co.
Meath (Newman 1997, 240). The skull at Raffin had
also been partially worn and may have been exposed
for some time prior to burial. Furthermore, the Raffln
skull was subsequently dated to around 200 years prior
to the date of the pit in which it was found (ibid.).
The area enclosed by the Kilmahuddrick ditch had
three cut features that contained cremated bone,
although bone from only two cuts was available for
analysis. On stratigraphie grounds, the earliest cut was
F87, a rather large cut with an irregular shape. The
lower fill of F87 contained a large amount of cremated
bone and was sealed by redeposited compact natural
grey clay. Over 200g of bone were recovered from F87,
the second-largest sample from the site. However, the
bone was very severely crushed, with over half of the
sample consisting of tiny fragments less than 5mm in
length and over 80% of the sample less than 10mm.
This made identification difficult and only 10% of the
bone could be identified. This consisted of efficiently
cremated human bone with skull and leg bones pres
ent as well as some fragments of pelvis, ribs and verte
brae. No arm, finger or toe bones were identified.
There may have been a juvenile present in this sample
as one fragment of juvenile femur was identified. How
ever, two separate identifiable fragments should be pres
ent to confirm the presence of an individual.
The second cremation cut, F77, had two different
fills. The lower, main fill was F39 and the upper fill was
F25.The upper fill had been disturbed but nevertheless

it was a large sample consisting of efficiently cremated
human bone. It was highly fragmented but it was pos
sible to identify 11% of the sample, which consisted
mainly of skull bones, including some mandible and
tooth fragments.The lower fill, F39, appeared to repre
sent one adult human cremation although a cremated
cow's tooth was found with one of the samples. The
sample was efficiently cremated and highly crushed,
which made identification of the long bones difficult.
There were some significantly large fragments of skull,
however, and a number of teeth fragments were also
recovered. The bone from F25 could have belonged to
the same individual as F39.
The only other sample, F69, appeared to have been
disturbed by the field boundary and contained rough
ly equal proportions of cremated and non-cremated
bone. The non-cremated bone was animal and most of
the cremated bone was also animal, although a few
fragments of human long bone were also present.
Conclusions
Nine very small samples were recovered from the
upper fill of the barrow ditch. These contained a mix
ture of cremated and non-cremated animal and human
bone. Most of the cremated fragments were too small
to identify. A separate non-cremated sample was found
in the ditch and consisted of the back of a human skull.
The bone was well worn and weathered and may have
been exposed for a considerable time before being
buried in the ditch.
The two cremation burials in the centre of the bar
row contained a significant quantity of cremated
human bone. One contained a single adult human cre
mation and a single cow tooth. The other contained a
cremated adult human and possibly a juvenile also. The
bone from the field boundary was mostly cremated and
uncremated animal bone, but may also have contained
some human fragments. The majority of the samples
were small and highly crushed, similar to token deposits
found from late Bronze Age or Iron Age contexts.
However, as they were found in the fill of the ditch it
is possible that they were not burials as such but
remains from the disturbance of other cremation buri
als.
The two cremation burials in the centre of the bar
row contained a significant amount of bone and were
therefore more than mere token deposits.The bone was
highly crushed, however, which meant a relatively low
proportion could be identified. Early Bronze Age cre
mations tend to be relatively uncrushed, with a high
weight of bone and recovery from all areas of the skele
ton (Buckley 1997; 1998).The burials from Kilmahud
drick were not efficiently collected and consisted
mainly of skull and long bones with little of the small
er bone or the axial skeleton. In fact they are similar to
burials from the middle Bronze Age flat cemetery and
late Bronze Age deposits at Killoran, Co. Tipperary
(Stevens 2005; Buckley 2005).
APPENDIX III
ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMAINS
FROM EXCAVATIONS AT
KILMAHUDDRICK
Penny Johnston
Introduction
Twenty-nine bulk soil samples were taken from the site
at Kilmahuddrick, Co. Dublin, where a ring-barrow
was excavated. The samples were processed by flotation
in order to extricate carbonised plant remains and char
coal. Heavy, non-floating material was retained in the
retents.The flots and retents were sorted to extract the
environmental content of each sample. These remains
were then analysed and the pattern of use of environ
mental material at the site was investigated.
Methodology
Soil samples were collected in bags of various sizes.
These samples were processed using a simple flotation
technique. Flots were collected in sieve meshes
measuring 300 ; retents were collected in meshes
measuring 1mm. The flots were sorted for
environmental material using a low-powered binocular
microscope (magnification x4.8 to x56); the retents
were sorted by eye. The entire volume of most of the
samples was processed. Owing to the large volume of
soil that was taken from several of the ditch fills,
subsamples were taken from several ditch contexts.
These subsamples measured five litres each. If a lot of
plant material was found during processing, it would
have been possible to sieve the remaining material from
these deposits. However, in the end this was not
deemed necessary. The frequency and potential of the
environmental material in each flot and retent were
recorded and the charred seeds were identified and
analysed with the help of a small modern reference
collection.
Results
Charred seeds, charcoal, snail shells and bone were
found in the samples. Two small artefacts were also
recovered during processing. The frequency of en
vironmental material in each sample is recorded in
Table 3. Taxonomic order is based on Scannell and
Synnott (1987).

Excavation of a prehistoric ring-barrow at Kilmahuddrick, Clondalkin, Dublin 67
Charred seeds
Charred seeds were present in fourteen of the
Kilmahuddrick samples: F5 (SI), F5 (S2), F4 (S3), F4
(S5), Fll (S8), F7 (S12), F8 (S18), F12 (S36), F39 (S58),
F41 (S70), F69 (S75), F77 (S77), F39 (S79) and F87
(S85).The frequency and variety of the seeds found were
particularly good in samples from F5 (SI), F5 (S2) and
F69 (S75).
Charcoal
Charcoal was found in the majority of samples sieved
from Kilmahuddrick. In some instances it was abun
dant; however, in many cases the fragments were very
small. Only two samples, from F5 (SI and S2), con
tained enough charcoal for conventional dating. Nine
teen samples had suitably large amounts of charcoal for
analysis of wood species identification (I. Stuijts, pers.
comm.). Only four samples, from F8 (SI9), Fl6 (S32),
F29 (S44) and F30 (S46), did not contain any charcoal.
Bone
Fragments of bone were found in eighteen samples.
The majority of this bone was recovered from the sort
ed retent, as this material does not float during pro
cessing unless the fragments are very small. The vast
majority of the bone was cremated and was probably
associated with ritual activity at the ring-barrow. Some
tooth fragments that survived indicate that this bone
was, at least in some cases, from animals rather than
from humans. Many of the bone fragments were dust
like, suggesting that they had been processed, possibly
by pounding or grinding. These do not appear in
samples with a high charcoal content. This suggests that
some of the bone was deliberately collected from the
pyre material, which would have contained a lot of
plant material, and then carefully deposited within
ditch fills or cremation burials. Only eleven samples
contained no cremated bone: F8 (S19), F8 (S20), F16
(S32), F12 (S36), F29 (S44), F30 (S46), F54 (S62), F58
(S67), F41 (S70), F83 (S83) and F86 (S84).
Shell
Three samples, F8 (SI8), F8 (SI9) and F87 (S85), con
tained snail shells. These examples of land molluscs may
be modern contaminants, as some varieties can burrow.
Land mollusc shells from antiquity are generally only
preserved in calcareous soil conditions.
Artefacts
Two beads were recovered during processing for
environmental material. A fragment of an amber bead
was found in F69 and an entire glass bead was recov
ered from F87.This latter bead is in poor condition and
the colour of the glass was destroyed during carbonisa
tion. Both of these beads were recovered in samples
that contained burnt bone and may have formed part
of the personal adornment of the cremated bodies.

Analysis of charred seed remains
The majority of the seed remains from Kilmahuddrick
were from cereal plants (51%).The other seeds found
were from weeds (27%), fragments of hazel nut (12%)
and the remains of berry fruits, such as haws and sloes
(10%). Cereal grains are frequently recovered from
archaeological sites as they survive charring better than
other parts of the plant, and better than many weed
species (Boardman and Jones 1990).They are also more
likely than other plants to come into contact with fire,
either during processing or cooking.
Many of the macrofossil remains from Kilmahud
drick were poorly preserved, being generally quite
heavily abraded. For example, many of the cereal grains
recovered fall into indeterminate categories (57%); this
means that they were not identifiable to genus level.
The distortion of these grains may have been linked to
damage from carbonisation. However, most of the
damage was caused by subsequent alterations in the
state of the seeds, changes in humidity and various
mechanical processes (Hubbard and al Azm 1990).
Many Kilmahuddrick samples were taken from ditch
es and it is probable that many of the seeds may have
been burnt rubbish that was scattered in the area prior
to its gradual accumulation into the deposits on the
site.This means that the plant remains assemblage is not
the product of one event but the result of a range of
processes and events that occurred on the site at vari
ous stages in the past, until the ditch deposits were
sealed.
Barley (Hordeum vulgare) was the most common
identifiable cereal from Kilmahuddrick ring-barrow
(27%); wheat (Triticum spp) (12%) and possible oat (cf.
Avena spp) (4%) were also found. Seven grains of bar
ley were found. Most of the grains were poorly pre
served and in many cases it was not possible to tell
whether they came from the hulled or naked varieties
of barley. However, a few grains were identified as
hulled barley. This fits into the general picture obtained
from Irish archaeobotanical assemblages, as hulled bar
ley is found more commonly than the naked barley
(Monk 1985/6). Although it takes longer to process,
hulled barley may be more tolerant of wet climates
than naked barley (Barker 1985), and this may explain
its prevalence in Irish archaeobotanical assemblages. In
general, barley may have been used in the preparation
of staple foods such as porridges, soups and breads
(Sexton 1998). It is sometimes used as a fodder crop, as
the straw can be used to feed cattle. Barley is also used
for bedding, as it is more absorbent than wheat straw
(Barker 1985).
Three wheat grains were recovered. Two of these
were identified as the primitive glume wheat, emmer
(Triticum dicoccum). It is assumed that prehistoric wheat
was primarily grown for human consumption,
although its straw can be used for thatching and for lit
tering livestock (Barker 1985).
One sample, F69, contained a possible fragment of
an oat grain (Avena species). Oat is a recognised crop in
the early medieval period, and evidence from archaeo
logical sites suggests that by that time it was the most
commonly grown cereal after barley (Kelly 2000).
There is no definite evidence that it was a crop in pre
history. Oats are likely to have grown as a contaminant
of the cereal crop in the prehistoric period. It is diffi
cult to distinguish the various oat species from each
other on the basis of the grain alone, and for this rea
son the grain recovered from Kilmahuddrick has only
been identified to genus level. Considering the prehis
toric context it is derived from, it is likely to be the
seed of a wild oat species, such as Avena strigosa.
Hazelnut shells (Corylus avellana) were recovered
from six samples. Hazelnuts contain essential fats.They
are also protein-rich and have been used throughout
history and prehistory as a valuable source of nutrients.
The carbonisation of hazelnut remains generally results
from the discarded shells being thrown into the fire
after the nuts are eaten. The nut shell is hard and resist
ant to decay, factors that ensure that it is commonly
recovered on archaeological sites (Monk 2000).
As many of the deposits that were sampled came
from the ditch fills and cremation deposits, it is assumed
that the plant remains found in the samples are related
to cremation activity. Possible haw seeds (Crataegus
monogyna) were recovered from F39 and F69. The
preservation of these seeds may result from the use of
hawthorn wood as kindling or firewood. The identifi
cation of fragments of hawthorn wood from the same
deposits would help to corroborate this hypothesis.
Carbonised haws were also found during analysis of
ritual contexts at Cherrywood, Co. Dublin.These were
also probably carbonised along with kindling from
hawthorn trees. Similarly, the stones of Prunus (mostly
sloe, Prunus spinosa) were recovered from three crema
tion deposits at Cherrywood and from one context at
Kilmahuddrick (F5). Like the berries of haw, these may
have been attached to twigs and wood used to light the
cremation pyre (Johnston, in progress).
The seeds that survive in cremation deposits tend to
be dense seeds such as sloe stones and haw seeds, as well
as cereals.Their density means that they are likely to fall
through the fire rather than to get caught at the top of
the fire where conditions are more aerobic (Moffett
1994).These would then be raked out after the fire had
died down.
Conclusion
Of the 29 samples from Kilmahuddrick examined for
environmental material, thirteen contained charred
seeds that were identified and analysed. Most of the

environmental material (seeds, charcoal and cremated
bones) from the samples was preserved by carbonisa
tion. The fruit stones discovered in association with
cremation material may have been related to the types
of wood and kindling used in the cremation pyre; sim
ilar results were obtained from other Irish cremation
material. The analysis of the archaeobotanical material
found at Kilmahuddrick has also identified the types of
cereals found on site. This suggests ' that the remains
from Kilmahuddrick are generally similar to those
obtained from other Irish sites of the same period.
APPENDIX IV
ANALYSIS OF CHARCOAL SAMPLES FROM
KILMAHUDDRICK
Ingelise Stuijts
Introduction
The analysis of charcoal remains can provide informa
tion on local vegetation as, for reasons of convenience,
fuel in prehistoric times was gathered close to the site
where it was to be burnt. Dry branches on the forest
floor or fallen trees served to kindle domestic fires.
When settlement was close by, discarded timber or
other rotten wood from fences etc. was used. In
medieval times, especially in towns, the transport of
firewood was often well organised and regulated. Char
coal from those contexts therefore does not necessari
ly reflect the local vegetation around the sites but more
likely coppiced woodlands.
It was hoped that analysis of the charcoal remains
from Kilmahuddrick would provide information on
the local tree growth during later prehistory and assist
in the interpretation of features on site. Accordingly, 28
samples from 22 features were analysed. The primary
aim of the charcoal assessment was to determine the
suitability of material for radiocarbon dating. The sec
ondary aim was to identify the wood species present in
order to determine whether any deliberate species
selection in antiquity was apparent.
Methods
The charcoal (flots and retents) was dry-sieved prior to
identification. All pieces large enough for identification
were selected, but all were smaller than the usual size of
0.5cm3. For initial sorting a low-powered stereo
microscope was used, while for identification a high
powered microscope with magnification of200x-400x
was employed. Where possible, the lumps were broken
prior to identification to expose a clean view of the
cross-section and the radial and tangential sides.
The identification followed the keys provided by F.
H. Schweingruber (1978). Oak is a hardwood species
and is resistant to wear and insects. Accordingly, this
species tends to be over-represented in samples. Fur
thermore, it is relatively easy to identify. As mentioned
above, the samples examined from Kilmahuddrick con
tained very little charcoal. Conventional radiocarbon
dating requires 4-5g of dried material, and in the case
of the Kilmahuddrick samples the weight of the species
was generally less than lg and the pieces were almost
beyond the size necessary for identification.
For each species within a sample the number of
lumps analysed (score) as well as the total weight of the
species (in grams) was noted. It was also noted how
often a species was found in Kilmahuddrick (frequen
cy occurrence). For example, hazel was found in eight
een of the 28 samples investigated, and elm occurred in
eight samples. In most samples more than one species
was present. The quantities were mostly too low to
ascertain which species was the dominant wood type
within a sample.

Wood species
The Kilmahuddrick area yielded a total of twelve wood
species. The dominant types were hazel (Corylus),
apple-type (Pomoideae) and sloe (Prunus spinosa), fol
lowed by ash (Fraxinus) and oak (Quercus). Both in vol
ume (measured in grams) and numbers (lumps
identified) hazel was the most common species. The
relatively low number of identified pieces of oak
suggests that this tree was not found in large numbers
locally.
The values for alder (Alnus) and willow (Salix) were
also relatively low. The presence of these species would
generally point to wet conditions. The suggestion that
the area may have been quite dry is supported by the
presence of ash, oak and elm, as these species usually
prefer dryland conditions. Wood species such as trav
ellers-joy (Clematis), spindle tree (Euonymus) and ivy
(Heder?) could very well have grown in hedges in the
same way as they do today, but could have grown
equally well at forest edges.
Wild cherry or bird cherry (Prunus avium /padus?
the species cannot be distinguished microscopically) is
not often found in modern hedges or forest edges.This
is a fast-growing tree, nowadays often planted on a
commercial basis. It is regularly encountered in other
prehistoric sites, mchidingfulachtafiadh. It would appear
that this species was more common in antiquity.
A noteworthy aspect of the Kilmahuddrick site was
the occurrence of apple-type and sloe. Together with
hazel, these species were quite normal in hedges or
fences. Sloe, with its large spines, was excellent for this
purpose, keeping animals (and humans) in and out of
fields. The apple-type of wood comprises several
species, such as crab apple, wild pear, hawthorn, white
beam and mountain ash, which are almost impossible
to distinguish microscopically. The presence of thorn
buds on some pieces would point to hawthorn rather
than the other species. The presence of hawthorn seeds
was observed in the analysis of seed remains. It would
thus seem that most samples indicate the presence
locally of field boundaries with thorny low shrubs or
scrub mixed with hazel.
Features
The majority of the samples derived from the fills of
the barrow ditch, F3.The upper layers of fill contained
charcoal inclusions, while the lower fills were almost
bare of charcoal fragments. This presents difficulties for
any conclusive analysis. In the ditch fills F5 and F6,
which represent the top layers of the ditch, six to eight
wood species were present. Spindle tree, ivy, willow and
traveller s-joy were absent in the upper ditch fills. In the
lower ditch fills only five species were found, with
alder, elm and wild cherry disappearing. The ditch fill
Fl4 had only ash, while the basal silt Fl7 contained
only tiny fragments of oak. Tentatively it may be
suggested, therefore, that ash and oak might have been
the dominant wood species during the period when
the lower ditch fills were forming, while later features
reflect the presence locally of wild shrubbery, maybe
following field boundaries.
At the base of the ditch around the barrow, stone
features were found with associated charcoal patches
(F15, F16, F28 and F30/31). F30 contained only ash,
while F28 had ash as well as oak charcoal. Other
features with only one or two wood species were F29
(field boundary with ash and oak fragments in the fill),
F107 (pit with oak fragments) and F106 (pit with hazel
fragments). Considering that most other samples had a
mixture of species, this could point to a specific use, but
caution is needed considering the small number of
charcoal lumps present.
In conclusion, features associated with the ring
barrow and surrounding ditch seem to contain prima
rily ash and oak. This includes the lower part of the
ditch fill (Fl4 and F17) and stones within the ditch
(F28,F15,F30).
Ash, oak and elm usually form part of the dryland
vegetation in the eastern and southern part of Ireland.
Elm gradually disappeared from the Irish landscape.
This decline started in the Neolithic period and can be
recognised in pollen diagrams. Ash, on the other hand,
generally increased from the Neolithic onwards, prof
iting from clearings in primary woodlands (Caseldine
and Hatton 1996). During periods of clearance, both
ash and elm, together with oak, show very low values
in pollen diagrams. In periods of less intense habitation
these three species re-established themselves and their
pollen values rise. The regular occurrence of ash asso
ciated with the ring-barrow points to the presence
locally offertile, clayey soil with many nutrients (ash is
a vigorous grower).
The other features contain a mixture of species,
between four and eight species within a sample, reflect

ing the presence of a mixed woody vegetation close by.
The charcoal within the later Bronze Age crema
tion deposit F39, at the centre of the barrow, consisted
of a range of species indicating a mixed environment,
such as can be found in present-day hedgerows or for
est margins. Although the quantities present were low,
it is clear that the most common wood species were
elm and hazel. Apple-type and sloe also occurred reg
ularly. The mixture of species probably reflects the local
presence of these wood types and the lack of prefer
ence of the local people in their choice of fuel.
Conclusions
Much of the charcoal recovered was so small that
observations regarding quality and growth were not
possible. Some charcoal of especially hazel, apple-type
and sloe show signs of insect channels and in some
cases it could be established that branches were burnt,
but generally the fragments were too small for definite
conclusions to be drawn.
The ring-barrow in Kilmahuddrick seemed to
contain primarily charcoal of ash and oak and as such
seems to indicate species selection. Other features, from

later periods, were more mixed in character, with many
wood species, especially hazel, apple-type (most likely
hawthorn) and sloe. This species composition is very
reminiscent of present-day hedges. Alternatively, these
species could also thrive on forest edges. Considering
the mixture of species in the upper layers no species
selection is indicated.
APPENDIX V
ANALYSIS OF THE FAUNAL REMAINS FROM
KILMAHUDDRICK
Melanie McQuade
Introduction
Excavations at Kilmahuddrick produced samples of
animal bone from the fills of the ditch enclosing the
ring-barrow (F4, F5, F7 and F8) and a later field
boundary (F29 and F69). These assemblages were
hand-retrieved and, as such, may be biased towards
larger bone pieces. Much of the material was frag
mented and modern breaks were also present. During
the processing of cremation samples (F4, F5, F39 and
F69) a number of burnt teeth, long bone and uniden
tifiable fragments were recovered. Material was identi
fied with reference to the comparative skeletal
collection at the Natural History Museum, Dublin.
Ping-barrow ditch
The largest sample of material was derived from F8, the
middle level, with smaller amounts from the overlying
fills (F7, F5 and F4) and only one tooth fragment from
the cremation deposits at the centre of the mound
(F39). All of the bones were fragmented and eroded
and, consequently, few were identifiable (Table 7). In
total there were 80 fragments, of which 33 (approxi
mately 41%) were unidentifiable. Twelve long bone and
three probable vertebral fragments could not be iden
tified to species.
The high proportion of teeth recovered from this
site may be explained by their higher survival rate and
the fact that in fragmentary material they tend to be
more readily identifiable. Given the fragmentary state
of the bone, it was of little value for purposes of aging
or measurement. Two distally fused humeri gave mini
mum ages of eighteen months for one of the cattle and
ten months for a sheep (after Silver 1969).While aging
is normally based on intact tooth rows, in their absence
loose second and third molars in wear give an approx
imate minimum age at death of 17-22 months for pig
(after Silver 1969). Measurements taken, in millime
tres, on a cattle scapula are as follows: LG: 52.2, GLP:
62.4, BG: 41.8 (after von den Driesch 1976).
Approximately 30% of the bones showed signs of
butchery. Many of the long bones had transverse cuts
and had been split longitudinally for marrow extrac
tion. A rough cut across the diastema of a cow mandible
was probably also made for this purpose, while a chop
across the distal shaft of a cow hum?rus could have
been made either to facilitate cooking or removal of
marrow.
While it would be unwise to draw too many con
clusions from such a small and fragmented assemblage,
all of the identifiable bone represents meat-producing
animals. Some of the bone is obviously food waste and
the presence of low-meat-value bones indicates that
animals were being killed and/or dismembered in the
vicinity.

Bones recovered from F69 and F29 date from the Iron
Age and early medieval period respectively. A small
sample of bone, approximately 60% of which was
burnt, was recovered from F69. This was very frag
mented and, apart from a cow tooth, could not be
identified to species. Approximately 45% of the assem
blage from F29 consisted of unidentifiable pieces, one
of which was burnt; the remainder are presented in
Table 8. Of these only three cattle bones allowed for
aging analysis. Measurements, taken in millimetres, on
a bovine metatarsal* are as follows: Bd:40, Bp:39,
GL:198.7 (after von den Driesch 1976).
Butchery marks were evident on approximately
10% of the bone from F29. These consisted of trans
verse chops and longitudinal splits for marrow extrac
tion. Such bones represent food waste, while bones of
lower meat value such as horncore, metapodials and
tar sals may be slaughter refuse. Given the small and
fragmentary samples retrieved from these contexts,
little can be inferred about the diet and economy of the
inhabitants of the time.

NOTES
1 National Grid coordinates from centre of ring
barrow: E304420/N231665.
2 Stone object 00E448:7 was kindly examined by
Ivor Harkin, Earth Science Section, Natural Histo
ry Division, National Museum of Ireland (query
GE/2001/37) in March 2001.The following report
was received: 'Small shaped "gaming" piece. Possibly
siderite. A depression like this may be formed nat
urally and may have included a clay ironstone nod
ule. However, there are signs of scoring/scratching
on the reverse of the piece that are man-made. It is
therefore not impossible that the depression is man
made.'
3 The sherd has since been cleaned and treated by a
trained conservator.
4 A full copy of this report, including an inventory of
the bone samples, can be found in the excavation
archive.
