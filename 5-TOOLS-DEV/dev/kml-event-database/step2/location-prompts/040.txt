Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid returning countries. Return only the location. Here's the information:

Basic description of event: European Agricultural Reset

Basic location of event: Europe

Specific data/information/context related to event: (PDF) Agriculture-Induced Population Fluctuations in Holocene Europe

S. Shennan, S.S. Downey, A. Timpson, K. Edinborough, S. Colledge, T. Kerig, K. Manning & M. G. Thomas (2013) Regional population collapse followed initial agriculture booms in mid-Holocene Europe. NATURE communications 1 Oct 2013. DOI: 10.1038/ncomms3486

Following its initial arrival in SE Europe 8,500 years ago agriculture spread throughout the continent, changing food production and consumption patterns and increasing population densities. Here we show that, in contrast to the steady population growth usually assumed, the introduction of agriculture into Europe was followed by a boom-and-bust pattern in the density of regional populations. We demonstrate that summed calibrated radiocarbon date distributions and simulation can be used to test the significance of these demographic booms and busts in the context of uncertainty in the radiocarbon date calibration curve and archaeological sampling. We report these results for Central and Northwest Europe between 8,000 and 4,000 cal. BP and investigate the relationship between these patterns and climate. However, we find no evidence to support a relationship. Our results thus suggest that the demographic patterns may have arisen from endogenous causes, although this remains speculative.
