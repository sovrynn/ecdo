The Museum's great standing skeleton is Mammuthus, the mammoth. Found in Indiana, this mammoth lived about 11,000 years ago. Mammoths were larger than their relatives the woolly mammoths but lacked their long, coarse hair.

The case at the base of the mammoth holds the mummified remains of "Effie," a baby woolly mammoth found in an open-pit gold mine in Alaska in 1948. After Effie died about 21,000 years ago, its remains were preserved in the frozen ground.
