Abstract

Recent archaeomagnetic data from ancient Israel revealed the existence of a so-called “Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic anomaly” (LIAA) which spanned the first 350 years of the first millennium before the Common Era (B.C.E.) and was characterized by a high averaged geomagnetic field (virtual axial dipole moments, VADM > 140 Z Am2, nearly twice of today's field), short decadal-scale geomagnetic spikes (VADM of 160–185 Z Am2), fast field variations, and substantial deviation from dipole field direction. The geographic constraints of the LIAA have remained elusive due to limited high-quality paleointensity data in surrounding locations. Here we report archaeointensity data from Georgia showing high field values (VADM > 150 Z Am2) in the tenth or ninth century B.C.E., low field values (VADM < 60 Z Am2) in the twelfth century B.C.E., and fast field variation in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. High field values in the time frame of LIAA have been observed so far only in three localities near the Levant: Eastern Anatolia, Turkmenistan, and now Georgia, all located east of longitude 30°E. West of this, in the Balkans, field values in the same time are moderate to low. These constraints put geographic limits on the extent of the LIAA and support the hypothesis of an unusually intense regional geomagnetic anomaly during the beginning of the first half of the first millennium B.C.E., comparable in area and magnitude (but of opposite sign) to the presently active South Atlantic anomaly.

1 Introduction

Detailed mapping of secular (short-term) variation of the geomagnetic field provides an essential indirect view into the geodynamics and thermal structure of Earth's core. Thus, a substantial effort has been made over the last several decades to reconstruct past secular variations, with particular focus on the recent several centuries and more broadly, the Holocene. Perhaps, the most remarkable secular variation feature in this time window is the presently active regional negative geomagnetic anomaly over the southern Atlantic presumably driven by a reversed core flux patch. Until recently, there was no evidence for other historical geomagnetic anomalies of this scale. Recently, Shaar et al. proposed the existence of an intense positive geomagnetic anomaly over the Levant in the beginning of the first millennium B.C.E. This so-called “Levantine Iron Age Anomaly” (LIAA) is characterized by 350 years (~1050 B.C.E. to ~700 B.C.E.) with high time-averaged field corresponding to virtual axial dipole moments (VADM) of about 140 Z Am2 (nearly twice today's axial dipole moment, 77 Z Am2). During this period of generally high field, at least two geomagnetic “spikes” occurred in the tenth and the eighth centuries B.C.E. reaching VADMs of 160–187 Z Am2 and perhaps even higher. The maximum directional deviations from axial dipole field direction in the LIAA period was at least 22°. The data set supporting the LIAA hypothesis include 70 high-precision paleointensity estimates from well-dated pottery, burnt structures, and radiocarbon-dated slag and directional data from in situ cooking ovens. To uncover the geographic extent of this anomaly, similarly dense high-quality data from the narrow time window of LIAA are required from nearby locations.

Accurate recovery of ancient geomagnetic field intensity (paleointensity) is not a straightforward task. It requires well-dated materials carrying a stable thermoremenent magnetization (TRM) held by submicrometer-scale single domain (SD) or small (flower state) pseudo single domain ferromagnetic particles, which are chemically resistant to repeated heating laboratory treatments. In the so-called “Thellier” procedure, the ancient TRM acquired in an unknown field is gradually replaced with laboratory TRM acquired in a known field through multiple heating steps at progressively elevated temperatures. It is a laborious, time-consuming, experimental procedure with a relatively low rate of success resulting from non-SD materials and experimental complexities. The interpretations of the experimental results, expressed as Arai plots and Zijderveld plots, can be nonunique and ambiguous. Thus, acceptance criteria based on paleointensity statistics are commonly applied to screen out unreliable interpretations. Additional uncertainties arise from remanence anisotropy and cooling-rate dependency of TRM, which result in a typical bias of noncorrected paleointensity calculation of 5–25%, and in many cases even more than that.

Considering the above methodological complexities, it may not be surprising that some regional paleointensity data sets derived by using different experimental methods, data interpretation guidelines, averaging schemes, and dating techniques can show considerable inconsistency and internal discrepancies. If the raw measurements are in hand, then this problem can be partly addressed by carefully assembling regional compilations by using identical laboratory and data analysis procedures. Two examples from the near east adopting such approach are the Levantine compilation that applies an automatic consistent interpretation routine by using strict acceptance criteria on the entire raw measurement data, and the Bulgarian compilation, which is based on the same laboratory treatments throughout the data set. When the raw measurement data are unavailable, it is critical to screen out less reliable data by using paleointensity statistics or other methods. This approach has been recently used by Pavon-Carrasco et al., who demonstrated the strong effect of quality criteria on regional geomagnetic modeling in Europe.

In this study we focus on the paleointensity behavior in Georgia in an effort to explore differences between the Levant and Georgia, located approximately 3000 km apart. The Caucasus was extensively studied in the 1970s and 1980s. The raw data from these publications are unavailable, but the published interpretations are available from the GEOMAGIA50 and the MagIC databases. Adequate analysis of the published data should take into consideration possible bias caused by data quality. Thus, following Pavon-Carrasco et al., we show in gray circles in Figure 2 data derived by using some form of the Thellier method. Data points in blue are derived by using the Thellier method with pTRM checks and at least four specimens. The latter criterion is necessary to average anisotropy effects. The high values in Georgian data set in the beginning of the first half of the first millennium B.C.E., with field values corresponding to geomagnetic spikes (VADM ~ 160 Z Am2), are the main focus of this study. As these data were not obtained by using the strict standards of modern studies, we provide here new paleointensity data from archaeologically dated potsherds and baked-clays in order to test the trend seen in the old data and compare the behavior in the Caucasus and the Levant.

Forty-eight potsherds and fired-clay samples from different archaeological contexts, mostly dated by using archaeological correlations, were analyzed in the paleomagnetic laboratory of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego. A detailed information of the archaeological contexts can be found in Appendix I in the supporting information. The samples were cut into 3–9 specimens, which were subjected to Thellier-type paleointensity experiment by using the IZZI protocol including routine pTRM checks at every second temperature step. Anisotropy of TRM was measured in six positions in 600° with additional baseline zerofield and alteration-check steps at the beginning and the end of the experiment, respectively. Cooling rate dependency was measured from three acquisitions of TRM in 600° cooled in fast air cooling (43°/min), slow spontaneous cooling (1.3°/min), and fast cooling as alteration check, respectively. Following Shaar et al. we assumed an averaged ancient cooling time of 6 h from 500° to 200° for all the archaeological samples. Data analysis was done by using the Thellier GUI program, part of the PmagPy software. We use the automatic interpretation technique by using the acceptance criteria listed in Table 1. The error bounds of the paleointensity estimates were calculated from two parameters: the standard deviation of the mean (σ) and the “extended error.” The latter takes into consideration all possible interpretations passing the criteria. Additional details regarding procedures and analyses can be found in Shaar et al.

Overall, 91 specimens out of 210 specimens passed the specimen level criteria (43% success rate) and 17 samples out of 48 passed the sample criteria (35% success rate). The samples' paleointensities are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 2 as red squares. Histograms showing distributions of statistics, and cooling rate and anisotropy corrections are given in the supporting information. Interpretations in the specimens and sample level with the corresponding statistical data, and the entire set of raw measurements are available in the MagIC database.

Four locations yielded 2–3 samples per age interval: Khovle and Atskuri show good internal consistency and Grakliani Gora and Tsminda Pchani show more scattered results. We note the relatively large uncertainty in the archaeological context of the samples from Grakliani Gora. We suggest that the source of the scatter in Grakliani Gora is a fast variation rate between the fifth and the third centuries B.C.E. This hypothesis is supported by the previous data that show a wide range of values in the 500 B.C.E. to 200 B.C.E. interval. Some of the locations yielded single samples per time interval; although passing our strict selection criteria, these time intervals should be further confirmed by more data. The new data shown in Figure 2 corroborate the main trends seen in the old data. Most importantly, they show the following features:

The high geomagnetic field (VADM of 145–154 Z Am2) in the ninth or tenth century B.C.E. is supported by three samples from Khovle. The geomagnetic low in the fourteenth or thirteenth century B.C.E. with VADMs < 60 Z Am2 is supported by two samples from Tsminda Pchani and Ortasheni necropolis. The large scatter in the data in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. with eight samples from Tsminda Pchani, Grakliani Gora, and Grakliani Hill shows VADMs ranging between 80 and 140 Z Am2. Also, one sample from Grakliani Hill yielded anomalously low value (50 Z Am2) that needs to be confirmed by more samples. This could be explained by fast field variations or age uncertainty. As age uncertainty of few hundred years in these sites is unlikely, we interpret the scatter as a period with fast field variations.

Three samples from the Iron Age site of Khovle showed high VADM values of 145–154 Z Am2 around 900 B.C.E. Considering the extended error bounds, these values are slightly lower than the Levantine geomagnetic spikes values (>160 Z Am2), but comparable in magnitude. Some of the published Caucasus data also show high field values in this period, with three samples showing VADMs of about 160 Z Am2 around 800 B.C.E. and a few quite high values (>160 Z Am2) coming from pottery from the second millennium B.C.E.; however, these do not meet the criteria of Pavon-Carrasco et al. Our new high values thus confirm the existence of a paleointensity high around 900 B.C.E. in Georgia. The picture is not so simple, however. There is a large dispersion of data in the 1000 B.C.E. to 800 B.C.E. interval with field values ranging from 50 Z Am2 to 150 Z Am2. Evidently, more high-quality well-dated data are required to fully characterize field variations in this period. The 900 B.C.E. high in Georgia is contemporaneous with the Levantine geomagnetic spikes, suggesting a link between the Levant and Caucasus. Both locations show fast field variations and exceptionally high field values. We conclude therefore that the LIAA extended at least to Georgia. Yet still, more data are required to understand the details of the LIAA evolution in the Caucasus.

With the new data in hand it is now possible to inspect the overall evidences for the geographic extent of the LIAA using the available paleointensity data from nearby localities. We display regional compilations outside the Levant using two sets of criteria: data obtained by using the Thellier method in gray symbols and data passing Pavon-Carrasco et al. criteria (Thellier-type methods with pTRM check and at least four specimens) in colored symbols. The Levantine paleointensity behavior, to which we compare the Georgian data, consists of the Central Levant data in red (analyzed and interpreted by using identical methods and selection criteria), and from Syria and Turkey in cyan. The LIAA period with the two spikes is highlighted by a shaded orange stripe. The Bulgarian data set provides a detailed paleointensity picture but has only a few samples covering the first half of the first millennium B.C.E.; this data set shows low to moderate values during the LIAA. The Greek data set, available from the GEOMAGIA50 and MagIC databases, also shows a paleointensity low during LIAA. From these data it seems that there was no paleointensity high in the Balkan during the LIAA, and thus, the Balkans mark its western limit. East of the Caucasus, the Turkmenistan data set shows a coherent paleointensity behavior with similar trends as the Levant and Georgia, and high field values corresponding to VADM of at least 150 Z Am2. Yet we note that these data do not meet Pavon-Carrasco et al.'s criteria, and thus shown in gray. We conclude that the LIAA extended from the Levant toward western Asia.

The inspection of the regional data shows two prominent peaks. The first of which is the LIAA east of the Balkans shown with orange stripe and discussed above. The second peak appears to be contemporaneous in all locations of the near east and is highlighted with green stripe. It reached values of 150–160 Z Am2 in Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece; 140 Z Am2 in the Levant; and possibly more than 160 Z Am2 in Turkmenistan (need to be confirmed by higher-quality data). This peak has been observed and discussed in previous studies and is associated with period of relatively fast secular variation in Europe. Also here, further data are needed to adequately describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of this second peak.

From comparison of paleointensity data sets from the Balkan, Caucasus, Levant, and Turkmenistan we conclude that a nondipole feature is required to explain the paleointensity difference in the interval between 1050 B.C.E. to 700 B.C.E. between Caucasus-Levant and the Balkans. We suggest that this nondipole feature is the regional positive geomagnetic anomaly suggested by previous research. Given the new high Georgian paleointensity data in the tenth or ninth century B.C.E. we conclude that the western limit of the Levantine Iron-Age Anomaly (LIAA) is along longitude lines of about 30E–35E.
