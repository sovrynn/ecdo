ABSTRACT
We describe and review the subfossil whale bones (mammalian order Cetacea)
material from the southern Scandinavian area, that is, Skagerrak, Kattegat, the
inner Danish waters and the southwestern Baltic Sea. Fifteen species were identified
from the subfossil records of which all, except for the bowhead whale (Balaena
mysticetus), have also been encountered in the modern times. Fifty-one specimens
were radiocarbon dated covering 12 of the subfossil species. The dates fell in three
distinct clusters with a few specimens before the last glacial maximum (LGM), a
large group between LGM and the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary (ca. 17.0–11.7
cal. kyr BP), and another large group from ca. 8.0 cal. kyr BP onward. Seventeen
of the radiocarbon dated specimens have been subjected to trace element analysis
by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis. Cross plots of the concentrations of
Fe and Zn, and Fe and Co show that it is possible to distinguish crayfish eaters
from fish/squid eaters. This can be used as a novel and independent method for the
determination to species of whale remains of otherwise uncertain speciation.

Key words: Late Pleistocene-Holocene, southern Scandinavia, whale remains,
species, distribution, chronology, trace elements.
Subfossil whale bones (mammalian order Cetacea) have been found in relatively
large numbers all over southern Scandinavia, and in Denmark alone 361 specimens
have been recorded from late Middle Weichselian, Late Weichselian, and Holocene
deposits. Due to glacier dynamics and dramatic changes in relative sea-level through-
out these periods, cetacean bones can be found in tills, out washed sediments, and in
raised marine shorelines and sediments.
Hitherto, no attempts have been made to review the entire material from the
southern Scandinavian area, that is, Skagerrak, Kattegat, the inner Danish waters,
and the southwestern Baltic Sea. Earlier, sporadic notes on the discovery of subfossil
whale remains, however, were provided by Nilsson (1847) in his survey of the
Scandinavian mammals, by Liljeborg (1861) in his account on the Swedish and
Norwegian whale species, and again in 1874 in his work on the entire mammalian
fauna of the two countries (Liljeborg 1874). During the end of the 19th century
Tauber (1878–1892) described whale remains in his Zoologica Danica.
The first publication to deal exclusively with subfossil remains of whales was
provided by Liljeborg (1867), who described the discovery of major parts of a skeleton
of a gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) from marine sand and clay deposits at Gr¨as¨o,
Roslagen (Sweden) and parts of a skeleton of a juvenile baleen whale designated
Balaena swedenborgii in marine sediments at Skara, V¨asterg¨otland (Sweden). Both
whales were already mentioned by Liljeborg in 1861 in his general survey of the
Scandinavian whale fauna where he had named the gray whale Balaenoptera robusta
and considered the Swedenborg whale as a distinct subfossil species. The latter view
was supported by Aurivillius (1888), who described the discovery of another juvenile
“Swedenborg whale,” this time in marine sediments at Tv˚a˚aker, Halland (Sweden).
Further arguments for giving the Swedenborg whale specific rank were given by
Nybelin (1942, 1946) who concluded that the specimens resembled neither the
bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) nor the Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). More
recently, Fred´en (1984) recommended postponing the final decision on the taxonomic
status until more remains become available. Lepiksaar (1986) stressed that safe
species identification should only be based on individuals that are skeletally mature
and therefore the Swedenborg whales should be regarded as juvenile specimens of
E. glacialis. The Gr¨as¨o specimen, on the other hand, is now generally accepted as the
holotype of the gray whale and named E. robustus (Liljeborg).
The first surveys of whale remains covering a larger geographical region were
carried out by Winge (1899, 1904). These catalogs enumerate 25 Danish finds of
whale bones belonging to bowhead whale (B. mysticetus), humpback whale (Megaptera
novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), beluga whale (Delphinapterus leu-
cas), killer whale (Orcinus orca), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), white-beaked
dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and list
both locality and other relevant details such as a tentative geological dating. The
next overview was provided by Degerbøl (1933) in an introduction to a compre-
hensive work on the prehistoric Danish mammal fauna. It added two new whale
species, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) from late glacial marine sediments
in northern Jylland and the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) from Kold-
ing Fjord, South Jylland (these latter remains probably originate from the 1861
AARIS-SØRENSEN ET AL.: SUBFOSSIL WHALE BONES 255
invasion of a large school of this species into the inner Danish waters, see Kinze
2007).
General faunal history reviews by Aaris-Sørensen (1998, 2007), Lepiksaar (1986),
Liljegren (1975), and Liljegren and Lager˚as (1993) have treated finds of more recent
dates and more specific contributions have been given by Lepiksaar (1966), dealing
with modern and fossil occurrences of toothed whales in Sweden, by Møhl (1970),
dealing with prehistoric seal and whale hunting in Denmark, and finally by Fred´en
(1975, 1984) the first to publish a series of radiocarbon dates of subfossil Swedish
whale remains.
The objective of this article is to present and characterize the Late Pleistocene
and Holocene whale fauna in southern Scandinavia. Successful dating of a large
number of subfossil whale remains allows us to describe the changes in species
richness and composition and changes in geographical and chronological distribution.
These changes can be compared with the changes in climate as reflected in the
highly dynamic environmental history of the last glacial-interglacial cycle in southern
Scandinavia.
It could be asked to what degree did the dramatic changes in land/sea configura-
tion, water temperature, and productivity determine the composition of the marine
mammal populations. Questions like this have direct relevance to modern nature
conservation and biodiversity management, especially in relation to future climate
changes. The results are furthermore linked to and compared with the historical
records built on stranding lists and whale observations in the area for the period
1575–2007 (Kinze 1995, 2007).
The background material for this study is provided mainly by the collection of
subfossil whale bones housed at the Zoological Museum (National History Museum
of Denmark), University of Copenhagen (ZMUC), as well as by the results of a
recently completed dating program including radiocarbon datings of 50 whales from
the Danish waters, the Swedish west coast, and the German Baltic coast. For a selected
group of specimens we have also performed trace element analysis, which may reflect
the food intake of the animal, and which in any event, helps to group less specific
specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The investigations presented here are mainly based on the collection of subfossil
whales kept at the Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, for the present
comprising 361 specimens from Danish waters. Among these 41 were selected for
radiocarbon dating along with seven Swedish and two German samples, which where
kindly made available to us by Naturhistoriska Museet, G¨oteborg, and Deutsches
Meeresmuseum, Stralsund. The selection procedure aimed to include as many species
as possible and to be as wide-ranging as possible in terms of geography and chrono-
logy, and at the same time to avoid preserved specimens and specimens expected to
contain insufficient amounts of collagen.
A total of 15 different species was identified in the Danish collection (Table 1).
Out of these it has been possible to date 12 by the radiocarbon method. In addition,
10 nonspecified baleen whales were successfully radiocarbon dated, as these were
expected to reveal important geological information.
The number of remains found in archaeological contexts makes up about 55% of
the specimens and consists mainly of smaller toothed whales, especially the harbor

porpoise (P. phocoena). The harbor porpoise was omitted from the radiocarbon dating
effort because a relatively high number of archaeological datings already documents
its history in southern Scandinavia as shown by Sommer et al. (2008).
The remaining 45% of the whale bones were found in geological, that is, non-
archaeological, contexts either in situ or redeposited. These bones mainly represent
large baleen whale or larger toothed whale species. The bones have been fished or
dredged from the sea bottom or excavated in raised marine sediments including
old beach ridges or found redeposited in glacial and glaciofluvial deposits. The
exception to these generally abundant find scenarios is 13 adjoining lumbar and
caudal vertebrae of a B. mysticetus specimen and an almost complete front half of a fin
whale (Balaenoptera physalus), both excavated in raised marine sediments in northern
Jylland (Table 2, 34 and 22). Normally subfossil whales were represented by a single
or a few bone elements only.
Identification
A safe identification of whale bones based on size and morphology completely
depends on the accessibility to a good reference collection of extant whale species
skeletons. The ZMUC, houses a very large and diverse collection that has been
successfully used in this study. The subfossil remains, however, most often con-
sist of rather fragmented vertebrae, skulls or ribs and more seldom of limb bones,
mandibles or single teeth sometimes preventing identification to species level (see

Table 2. List of analyzed whale remains and the results of the radiocarbon dating (16 of the dated specimens plus one undated have also been
analyzed for trace elements; see Table 5). The column “Element dated” indicates which part of the whale has been sampled. The column “ 14 C method”
indicates if the radiocarbon dating has been performed by the conventional method by use of a proportional counter (Conv.) or by Accelerator Mass
Spectroscopy (AMS). 13 C is the stable isotope ratio 13 C/12 C measured against Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB), the international standard used by
all radiocarbon laboratories. The calibrated date is given as the outer boundaries covering the interval ± 1 .

Table 1). About one-third of the whale specimens in the ZMUC collection could
not be identified to species level. The problems with the identification are espe-
cially connected to the distinction between the two right whale species (making
up one-third of the dated specimens) and between the different rorquals (Genus
Balaenoptera). Distinguishing between the two monodontid species (D. leucas and
262 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 26, NO. 2, 2010
Monodon monoceros) also presented some difficulty depending on the available bone
elements. However, one of the seven specimens of Monodontidae found in Den-
mark, could be identified with certainty to D.leucas from a cervical vertebra (at-
las) (Winge 1899). Besides, several complete or almost complete skeletons of
D. leucas have been found on the Swedish west coast (Lepiksaar 1966, Fred´en 1984).
So far no subfossil remains of M. monoceros have been identified in southern Scandi-
navia. Therefore, the other six Danish specimens (all caudal vertebrae) have similarly
been assigned to D. leucas.
Radiocarbon Dating
In the present work, we undertook the radiocarbon dating of many new specimens
of whales found in either archaeological or geological contexts. Out of the 41 Danish
and 2 German whale bone samples, 39 were dated successfully at the Copenhagen
Radiocarbon Laboratory utilizing a conventional proportional counter (Rasmussen
2000). The remaining four samples contained insufficient amounts of collagen. The
seven Swedish specimens were dated by the Aarhus AMS radiocarbon laboratory for
our work. By adding another five samples dated earlier, a grand total of 51 dates are
listed in Table 2.
The stable isotope ratio, 13 C, was measured on all 51 samples, and the dates were
corrected for isotopic fractionation referring them to the marine value of 0 VPDB.
This corresponds to subtracting a reservoir correction of 405 yr from the standard
radiocarbon age, which is referred to 13 C = −25 VPDB.
Three of the samples were dated to be modern, and one older than the dating
limit. The dates that could be calibrated were calibrated with the OXCAL program
using the Reimer et al. (2004) curves. The calibrated date intervals at ±1 SD are
listed in Table 2, and shown in Figure 1.
Trace Element Determination
Seventeen samples were subjected to trace element analysis. This was done using
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) on ca. 500-mg samples of bone
tissue. In order to reduce the effect of contamination present on the surface of the
whale bones, an exterior layer of ca. 1 mm of the bone was removed with a drill or
with a scalpel prior to sampling. The samples were irradiated at the now disassembled
heavy water reactor DR3 at the National Laboratory at Risø, Denmark, with a typical
neutron flux of 1013 cm−2 s−1 and an irradiation time of 4 h. Standard samples as
well as flux monitors were included in the irradiation. The activated samples were
subjected to three counts on a high purity GeLi-detector at the Geological Institute,
University of Copenhagen. All samples were analyzed only once. The resulting
concentrations are listed in Table 3. The uncertainties are mostly in the range of
10%–15%.

in Figure 1 and the geographical distribution of the dated whales is shown in
Figure 2.
The dates fall into three well-defined groups. The oldest group (five dates) range
from ca. 33.0–21.0 cal. kyr BP corresponding to a period during the Weichselian
with prevailing interstadial conditions beginning in the late Middle Weichselian
and ending with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Fig. 3a). The next group
(18 dates) covers the deglaciation period between the LGM and the Pleis-
tocene/Holocene boundary, ca. 17.0–11.7 cal. kyr BP (Fig. 3c). Finally, the youngest
group (24 dates) range between ca. 8.0 cal. kyr BP and the present time corresponding
to the time after the Early Atlantic transgression and the formation of the Danish
islands (Fig. 4). In terms of climate and marine environments the three periods

correspond to the arctic-subarctic Older Yoldia Sea, the arctic-subarctic-boreal
Younger Yoldia Sea and the boreal-lucitanian Littorina/Tapes Sea.
A majority of the dated specimens belonging to the two oldest groups, includ-
ing a single nonfinite date of >38 kyr BP (K-7103), were found in northern
Jylland and Bohusl¨an on the Swedish west coast. This is in agreement with the
glacial history and palaeogeography as outlined by recent geological studies (see e.g.,
266 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 26, NO. 2, 2010
Figure 3. (Continued)
Houmark-Nielsen and Kjær 2003, Houmark-Nielsen et al. 2005), which implies
a geographical distribution of the Older and Younger Yoldia Sea corresponding to
the present Skagerrak and Northern Kattegat (Fig. 3a, c) and occasionally reaching
as far south as Northern Sjælland (Bahnson et al. 1974, Petersen and Buch 1974).
In accordance with this the members of the youngest group have been found much
more dispersed and further south following the later emerging coast lines along the
inner Danish waters (Fig. 4).
The geologically and archaeologically dated specimens listed in Table 1
support the results obtained through the radiocarbon dating. The re-
mains of Delphinus delphis, Stenella sp., and P. phocoena have, however, been
solely archaeologically dated which place the two dolphins within the Late

Atlantic–Early Subboreal (Late Ertebølle–Early Neolithic Cultures) and the har-
bor porpoise between the Early Atlantic (Kongemose Culture) and the present time.
The latter is in agreement with the conclusion by Sommer et al. (2008) that places
the first immigration of the harbor porpoise into the Baltic Sea at 9.0–7.5 cal. kyr
BP. A much earlier occurrence is, however, known from the Kattegat area where a
specimen found on the Swedish west coast at Kyvik, Halland (Lepiksaar 1966) has
been radiocarbon dated to ca. 12.9–12.0 cal. kyr BP (Fred´en 1984) (Table 3). This
indicates the presence of the harbor porpoise in the Skagerrak/Kattegat area since the
late glacial followed by an expansion into the inner Danish waters and the Baltic Sea
in the wake of the early Atlantic transgression. Table 3 summarizes the chronolog-
ical distribution of the 15 whale species in the Danish/southern Scandinavian area

based primarily on this study, but supplemented with earlier radiocarbon dated and
archaeologically dated specimens available in the ZMUC files and the literature. In
comparison with the recent cetacean fauna the following differences and similarities
should be noted.
The waters around the present Denmark include part of the North Sea, Skagerrak,
Kattegat, the Belt Sea, and the Øresund as well as the westernmost Baltic proper
and span in depth from 0 to several hundred meters.
Twenty-two whale species have been documented from the recent Danish waters
alone, and two additional species are known from adjacent Swedish waters, that is,
AARIS-SØRENSEN ET AL.: SUBFOSSIL WHALE BONES 269
Cuvier’s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) and narwhale (Monodon monoceros), see
Table 3. Among these there are two native species, the harbor porpoise (P. pho-
coena) and the white-beaked dolphin (L.albirostris); four common species, the Atlantic
white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), the long-finned pilot whale (Globicehala
melas), the killer whale (O. orca), and the common minke whale (Balaenoptera acu-
torostrata); and 18 more or less frequently occurring stragglers from waters either
differing in temperature, in water depth, or both. Their occurrence is linked to
hydrographical phenomena such as saltwater intrusions and fluctuations in surface
water temperature (Kinze et al. 2001).
The two native species and two of the common species (killer whale and minke
whale) are also among the most frequently found subfossil species documenting their
long presence in southern Scandinavia (Table 1). The two other common species, the
Atlantic white-sided dolphin and the long-finned pilot whale are, however, totally
absent in the subfossil record. This is probably due to the fact that they are both
offshore species normally found in deeper waters in the Danish sector of the North Sea
and Skagerrak. A low number of strandings along the coast of the inner Danish waters
in the past should therefore be expected. Only two incidents of mass strandings are
known from the inner Danish waters during the last century, one of the white-sided
dolphin in Roskilde Fjord in 1942 and one of the pilot whale in Vejle Fjord in 1954
(Kinze 1995).
Among the baleen whales the list comprises four species that do possess the capacity
to dwell in coastal waters. These are, besides the already mentioned common minke
whale (B. acutorostrata), the fin whale (B. physalus), the humpback whale (Megaptera
novaeangliae), and the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis). The subfossil record
suggests that the latter has visited the Danish waters ever since the Weichselian
and probably have had a more common occurrence before the severe exploitation
during historical times. The other right whale, the bowhead (B. mysticetus), has also
almost been wiped out by commercial whaling in historical times and has never
been recorded in the local national stranding lists (Kinze 1995, 2006b, Kinze et al.
1998, 2001). On the other hand it is well represented in the subfossil record where
the 16 specimens from Danish collections can be supplemented with 30 finds from
the Swedish west coast (Fred´en 1984) of which four have been included in the
present dating program. The majority of the dates fall within the arctic-subarctic
late Glacial period that is in accordance with the modern biology of this circum-arctic
whale which is seldom sighted south of 45◦N. A few young dates ranging between
ca. 1.5 and 5.0 cal. kyr BP nevertheless indicate that the bowhead was an occasional
visitor to southern Scandinavian waters during post-glacial times prior to modern
exploitation.
Another witness of the full glacial/late glacial environment is the beluga whale
(D. leucas). Today this arctic coastal species occasionally conducts extralimited mi-
grations into more southerly waters including the inner Danish waters (Kinze 2007).
This is in accordance with the subfossil record that only reveals a single Danish find
from the boreal-lucitanian Littorina/Tapes Sea but several Swedish and Danish finds
from the arctic-subarctic Yoldia Sea.
Three warm temperate to tropical dolphin species (D. delphis, Stenella sp., and
T. truncatus) indicate much warmer sea water temperatures during earlier peri-
ods. They have all been found in archaeological contexts and hereby dated to
the Late Atlantic–Early Subboreal period corresponding to the postglacial climatic
optimum.
270 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 26, NO. 2, 2010
Finally it should be noted that the northern bottlenose (Hyperoodon ampullatus)
as well as the sperm whale (P. macrocephalus) both are strictly oceanic species that
get beached accidentally either on shallow tidal flats or in coastal areas of complex
hydrography. This seems to have happened in the past as well.
Trace Element Concentrations
The trace element concentrations determined in this work are listed in Table 4.
The first question to be raised is whether bone diagenesis has occurred on a large
scale. If diagenesis has occurred in a systematic way over a scale of hundreds or
thousands of years it is likely that it would lead to progressive loss of Ca with
increasing age. However, no correlation is seen between Ca and age, the correlation
coefficient is r2 = 0.0013. Another conceivable way diagenesis might be manifested
is by progressive loss of collagen with increasing age. No correlation is seen in this
case either, the correlation coefficient is calculated to be r2 = 0.0216. According
to these two criteria we see no signs of long-term diagenesis. However, it is still
possible that diagenesis has occurred on a shorter time scale not reflected in these
criteria. If this has been the case it is likely that the diagenetic processes encompass
single elements related to the marine environment, for example, as demonstrated for
As in Mesolithic human and animal bones buried in an area later covered by the sea
(Rasmussen et al. 2009). Guided by the findings of Rasmussen et al. (2009) we find
it likely that a variation in the As concentration in the bones could be ascribed to
processes involving decomposition of kelp or other marine plants with a high content
of As, and therefore variations in As is not considered worthwhile to look at in this
connection.
Trueman et al. (2004) showed massive diagenesis in bones deposited on the surface
of the savannah in Africa, but these alterations were ascribed to the osmotic raise of
ground water from the soil, through the bone and followed by evaporation from the
bone, thus leading to an ever increasing concentration of the trace elements in the
bone. Trueman et al. (2004) also showed collagen to disappear within decades after
deposition on the surface. However, our scenario is radically different, as the whale
bones were deposited on the seafloor in the somewhat anoxic, cold conditions of the
inner Danish waters. We observed only four cases out of 43 where complete collagen
removal have taken place. So there is no reason to think that the results of Trueman
et al. (2004) will apply to our samples. We have also shown that Hg is probably not
mobilized in human bones buried in Danish soil (Rasmussen et al. 2008) lending
credence to the assumption that bones are not always subjected to diagenesis.
Even if it could be assumed that diagenesis has not occurred to any large extent, an
invasion of terrigenic clastic material has almost certainly occurred. Small sediment
particles from the surrounding sea bed have undoubtedly invaded the pore spaces
in the porous and less competent parts of the bone. Even though great care has
been taken to decontaminate the surface of the bone during sampling, it is most
likely that soil particles at least to a minor degree are part of the samples analyzed.
Examples of elements that must be considered to originate mainly from invasion of
terrigenic clastic material are the REE (Rare Earth Elements), eight of which are
listed in Table 4, as well as Sc, Ta, and Th. Consequently, we have also eliminated
these elements from use in this study.
Even if diagenesis might occur for some elements, it is, however, also possible
that the dietary habits are reflected in the distribution of some of the trace elements.

In order to investigate this, we have listed the major food preference for the whale
species in this study in Table 5.
The food preferences do indeed show up, particularly in Fe, Cr, and Zn. Based on
Zn vs. Fe plot (Fig. 5) there is a clear distinction between crayfish eaters on one hand
and fish and squid eaters on the other. A similar if not quite so clear division is seen
for Cr vs. Fe (Fig. 6). This rather clear distinction or grouping could be caused by a
difference in the amount of, or the chemistry of, the invasive sedimentary particles,
as described above. If the difference arose this way, it can either be due to a difference
in bone porosity upon degradation of the organic parts of the different species, or it
could be caused by a preference of special types of seabed where one species chooses to
die. As an alternative explanation, it is possible that genetic differences between the
whale species are responsible for both a different dietary preference and a different
ability to incorporate certain trace elements into the skeletal organ.
Finally, it is possible that the trace element composition pattern is transferred in a
uniform way from the food items to the bones of the whales. In this simple scenario the
trace element chemistry of the bones reflects whatever the whales forage on. With the
present data, we are not able to distinguish between these alternatives. In addition,

we have not shown where the trace elements are situated—in the bone carbonate
fraction, in the organic fractions, the nervous tissue or the fat, or in terrigenic clastic
sediment grains.
Irrespective of the mechanism responsible the distribution of the trace elements
Fe, Cr, and Zn seems none the less to be a way to distinguish between crayfish eaters
from fish/squid eaters. It should therefore be possible to use these divisions in the
elemental cross plots as a help in determining species. As an example, it can be seen
from Figures 5 and 6 that specimen number 8 from Poulsker, Bornholm, which by
morphology has been determined and registered in the collection as Balaenoptera sp.,
is likely to have been a fish/squid eater. This challenges the identification and makes
it worth considering whether this fragmented vertebral body in fact belongs to a
sperm whale.
Conclusions
Based on our investigations we draw the following conclusions:
1. The subfossil whale record of southern Scandinavia comprises at least 15
different species. Except for the bowhead whale (B. mysticetus) they are all
documented in the modern fauna as well.
2. The modern fauna counts 24 species of which only two, the harbor porpoise (P.
phocoena) and the white-beaked dolphin (L. albirostris) are native species to the
area. Another four species, the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (L. acutus),
the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas), the killer whale (O. orca) and the
common minke whale (B. acutorostrata) are common in southern Scandin-
avian waters while the rest are more or less frequently occurring stragglers.

red (or horizontal bars) = crayfish; green (or dots) = fish; yellow (or vertical bars) = squid;
blue (or filled black) = mammals. This figure is available in color online.
3. The harbor porpoise, the white-beaked dolphin, the killer whale and the
common minke whale are also among the most frequently found subfossil
species while the two offshore species, the white-sided dolphin and the pilot
whale, are absent from the subfossil record as they probably stranded very
rarely in the inner Danish waters.
4. The two right whales, the bowhead (B. mysticetus) and the North Atlantic
right whale (E. glacialis), seem to have been occasional visitors to the southern
Scandinavian waters prior to the severe exploitation during historical times.
5. The large-scale climatic events during the last glacial-interglacial cycle are
reflected in the whale fauna. Two species, the north Atlantic/arctic-subarctic
beluga whale (D. leucas) and the minke whale (B. acutorostrata), were recorded
from the time prior to the LGM, (>38.0–ca. 21.0 kyr BP), eight species from
the deglaciation period between LGM and the Pleistocene/Holocene bound-
ary (ca. 17.0–11.7 cal. kyr BP) including the circum-arctic bowhead whale
(B. mysticetus) and fifteen species, including warm temperate/tropical dolphins,
during the Holocene from ca. 8.0 cal. kyr BP and onward.
6. The whale remains belonging to the two oldest groups have all been found
in northern Jylland and Bohusl¨an on the Swedish west coast. This is in ac-
cordance with the palaeogeographical settings presented by recent geological
investigations and it seems that a southern Scandinavian whale fauna existed
during the Weichselian glaciation whenever interstadial conditions created a
palaeo-Skagerrak-Kattegat (Older Yoldia Sea and Younger Yoldia Sea). Re-
mains belonging to the youngest group have been found much more dispersed
and further south in accordance with the creation of the inner Danish waters
by the transgressing Littorina/Tapes Sea.
7. Trace element cross plots exhibit distinct differences between certain whale
species. With cross plots of the element concentrations of Fe, Zn, and Cr, it

is possible to distinguish crayfish eaters from fish/squid eaters. This can be
used as a novel and independent method to aid the determination to species
of whale remains.
