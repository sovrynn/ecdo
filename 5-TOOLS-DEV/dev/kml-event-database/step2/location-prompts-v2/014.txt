Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid simply returning a country. Return only the location, including the corresponding country and continent. Here's the information:

Abstract

The Swedish foil piston corer is perfect for taking long oriented sediment cores. The paleomagnetism in three Swedish varved clay cores record the annual changes during periods of about 100–150 years. An 11‐yr sunspot cyclicity is well established in the magnetic records. The amplitude variations are large. In thick varves (proximal varves and drainage varves), the inter‐annual magnetic variations are recorded. The intensity shows a clear annual cyclicity (independent of sedimentological variations). Declination and inclination show an annual cyclicity, too. The amplitudes of the sunspot and annual cyclicities are too large solely to be the effect of ionization changes. Chemical‐physical environmental changes must have played an important role in both cases. The recorded annual and seasonal magnetic (NRM) fluctuations are so large in amplitude that they in unvarved sediments without good dating control might have been classified as “excursions”; or major secular variations.
