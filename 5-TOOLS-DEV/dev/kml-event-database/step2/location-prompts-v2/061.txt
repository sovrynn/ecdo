Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid simply returning a country. Return only the location, including the corresponding country and continent. Here's the information:

Basic description of event: Piora Oscillation

Basic location of event: Switzerland

Specific data/information/context related to event: Piora Oscillation - Wikipedia

The Piora Oscillations are two cold periods in the Alpine climate history of the Holocene Epoch. Its dating differs between authors and no consistent modern approach currently exists. The spatial extent of the change is unclear; moreover, it does not show up as a major, or even identifiable, event in hemispheric temperature reconstructions.

First detection
The phenomenon is named after the Val Piora or Piora Valley in Switzerland, where it was first detected; some of the most dramatic evidence of the Piora Oscillation comes from the region of the Alps.
