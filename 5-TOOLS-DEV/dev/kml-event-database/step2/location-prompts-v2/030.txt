Ancient Celtic traditions and Arthurian romances abound with tales of “glass castles” and “glass cities.” Ancient vitrified (that is, turned to glass) remains of stonework, buildings, and cities have been reported from around the globe. Admittedly some of these reports are more reliable than others. Among the best-documented examples of ancient vitrification are various hill forts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Having studied ancient hill forts in Scotland and Wales, I can testify to the authenticity of vitrification. But what is its origin and significance? Drawing from decades of fieldwork that has taken me from Egypt to Easter Island, the answer I propose entails a new way of thinking about our ancient past. Relatively few people are aware of vitrified stone forts, one of the great mysteries of antiquity. To the untrained eye, vitrified forts are not particularly impressive. They generally appear to be walls of stone rubble, lacking any true masonry work, built on the tops of hills. The majority of known vitrified forts are found in Scotland, with others reported from England, Ireland, Wales, and also France, Germany, and as far afield as Turkey and Iran. A typical example of a vitrified fort, one that I have examined firsthand, is the Mote of Mark in Scotland. What distinguishes a vitrified fort? The stone walls and structures have been subject to intense heat, to the point where some of the rocks have melted and fused, forming masses of material that can resemble the slag produced when smelting and refining metals, similar to materials produced during some types of volcanic eruptions. It is referred to as “vitrification” (vitrum = glass) because the melted rock can solidify as a crude, generally dark, glass which hundreds or thousands of years later may not look much like glass at all to the untrained eye. In order to melt and vitrify the rock, incredibly high temperatures are required – on the order of 1,000 degrees Centigrade. The vitrification typically occurs on the tops and outer surfaces of the rock walls, and not in their interiors. The big questions are how could this occur? And why? Before we address these questions, we need to consider another thorny issue: the timeframe of the vitrified forts, which in turn bears on the issue of how the forts may have been vitrified. How far back does vitrification go? It is generally agreed among conventional historians and archaeologists that vitrified forts date back to at least the Iron Age (in the UK, about 800 BCE to the early centuries CE), and were used up through the early Dark Ages, circa 700 CE and later. The latter portion of this span, the late 5th and 6th centuries CE, corresponds to the time when the famous King Arthur supposedly lived and died. King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table may have gathered at a vitrified hill fort known as Camelot. A Welsh manuscript records a poem, titled PREIDDEU ANNWN (“The Spoils of Annwn” – Annwn refers to the “otherworld” or the world of the gods), attributed to the British bard Taliesin of the middle and late 6th century CE. The poem tells of Arthur and a Glass Fortress or Castle. Who would think of making a fort of glass? Traditionally the reference to glass has been seen as a fanciful metaphoric analogy to the realm of the gods and other beings. But, could it have been rooted in reality? Could genuine vitrified forts have been the basis for the concept of a glass fortress or castle? I believe the answer is yes. Glass Castles & Fire from the Sky A new Theory of Ancient vitrification Relatively few people are aware of vitrified stone forts, one of the great mysteries of antiquity. However, this is not to say the vitrified forts necessarily originated at the time of the legendary chieftain. Vitrified forts may have been an inheritance from a much more remote period. Arthur and his contemporaries may have reused already very ancient forts, structures that had undergone vitrification centuries or millennia earlier. Indeed, the vitrified forts and other megalithic stonework might very well have been considered the “spoils of Annwn,” that is, the remnants of the world of the ancient gods. The Mote of Mark (the Scottish vitrified fort, also known as Rockcliffe) illustrates this possibility. During excavations, artefacts from the Roman and early Christian periods were found along with an abundance of material from the 6th and 7th centuries CE and even a piece of Mediterranean glass that could date to the 9th century CE. But, more remarkably, over a hundred worked flints possibly dating to the Mesolithic – that is, the period of circa 8000 BCE to 4000 BCE – were found. Thus, the Mote of Mark may trace its origins to 10,000 years ago, and was intermittently used and reused over the course of nine millennia! How did the Mote of Mark and other forts come to be vitrified? A number of explanations have been proposed. Some believe the builders of the forts did it purposefully, or alternatively that it was the result of attackers attempting to destroy the forts. If purposeful, perhaps vitrification was a way to bond and strengthen the rock walls in lieu of mortar. Huge amounts of wood and other flammable substances were presumably piled against the walls and set ablaze, creating intense heat and melting the surface rocks. The problem is that virtually all studies conclude that vitrified walls are actually weaker and more brittle than non-vitrified walls. The vitrification occurs only on the upper surfaces and tops of walls, which are otherwise built on foundations of rubble, and thus could easily collapse. Another popular theory suggests the vitrification resulted from enemy attacks. The forts were originally built of stone and wood, with wooden superstructures and in some cases wooden logs inside the stone and rubble walls. The assaulting enemy might have purposefully set the fort on fire, and the ensuing conflagration may have caused the vitrification. But could setting fire to a fort really generate the extremely intense heat necessary to melt rock? And why would the defenders continue to build structures containing so much wood that they were vulnerable to such attacks when there was certainly plenty of stone available? Or, did the attackers possess a fire-based weapon that we no longer understand? Did they have something similar to modern napalm? Had they discovered a toxic mixture of flammable chemicals (the recipe a closely guarded secret that has since been lost) that could generate enormous temperatures and could not be extinguished? The classical ancients mention “Greek fire” that could be hurled and catapulted at the enemy, and would even burn under water. But whatever “Greek fire” may have been, even if the accounts are not exaggerated, it is difficult to see how it could be used extensively enough to cause the amount and degree of vitrification seen in the forts. Some researchers have suggested that vitrification along the tops of fort walls was the result of lighting beacon fires. But it is odd that beacon fires would be intense and hot enough to vitrify the rock. And those forts that are vitrified continuously around the perimeters, does that mean beacon fires were built in continuous lines along the tops of the walls? This too seems odd; it would perhaps make more sense to build beacon fires at designated spots best observed by those who were intended to see the fires. Or were the tops of the forts purposefully vitrified to make a sort of walking path? At a loss to explain the reasons behind vitrification of the forts, one researcher suggested vitrification was a purposeful ceremonial or religious rite, despite the fact that the vitrification weakens the structure! Perhaps, according to this theory, vitrification was used to dedicate or “christen” a fort, or was an act of supplication to a deity, served to commemorate a victory or other significant event, or to simply inspire the masses. I cannot say that I find this theory particularly compelling. More exotic theories have been proposed to explain the vitrification. One early idea suggested that the structures were built near ancient volcanoes, and the builders used naturally molten rock to construct their forts. In actuality the forts are not near active volcanoes, and how the builders would have transported and manipulated molten rock is a difficult question to answer. Another theory, popular to this day in some circles, is that the vitrification was the result of ancient atomic warfare. The vitrification occurs predominantly on the tops and outer edges of the walls, as if blasted by an incredibly intense heat from above. Furthermore, vitrified forts tend to be found on the tops of hills and other promontories. It certainly sounds like melted rock could have been produced by an atomic bomb exploding in the sky above, but did the ancients have nuclear weapons in the remote past? As appealing as ancient nuclear weapons may be to some sensibilities, I have my doubts and as a geologist I tend to look for other, more naturalistic, explanations first. However, the evidence does suggest that the causative factor originated from the skies above. A possible explanation, which I have heard more than a few times from various people over the years, is that perhaps the mid-air explosion of a meteor, comet, or asteroid, was responsible. Such an incoming space object (bolide) could create a tremendous blast in the atmosphere, generating intense heat and massive destruction over a widespread area, as was the case in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. The Tunguska object exploded with an estimated force of between 500 and 2,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs, scorching and levelling trees over a vast area, yet no major crater formed, perhaps because the explosion took place about 5 to 8 kilometres above Earth’s surface. As I have documented in my book Voyages of the Pyramid Builders, Earth has had close encounters with comet-like objects a number of times in the last six thousand years, and certainly many times prior to recorded history. Indeed, there is good documentation for a comet intersecting with Earth’s orbit in the middle of the 6th century CE, the traditional period of King Arthur. Might a comet have been responsible, at least in part, for initiating the beginning of the Dark Ages, a time of calamity and loss? I find the comet explanation for the vitrified forts plausible, but there are other phenomena that originate in the sky as well. Even if it can be demonstrated that some vitrification dates to the sixth century and correlates with a cometary impact, it may be an incorrect oversimplification to conclude that all episodes of vitrification were due to close encounters with comets. Major lightning strikes can cause intense heat discharges resulting in the melting, fusing, and vitrification of sand and rock. But is simple lightning, as we know it today, intense enough and extensive enough to explain the amount and degree of vitrification observed on the ancient forts? I believe something more is needed. Lightning is actually a type of plasma phenomenon. Plasmas essentially consist of ionized gases or charged particles, and together with magnetic and electric fields, they ubiquitously pervade interplanetary to intergalactic space. The aurorae borealis and australis (northern and southern lights) are plasma related phenomena, as are large-scale upper atmospheric phenomena known as sprites. There is evidence that in the ancient past the surface of our planet was occasionally subjected to major plasma events. These may have taken the form of huge electrical outbursts with electric “sparks” or “lightning” that hit the surface, incinerating any flammable materials and melting and vitrifying the underlying rocks. The cause may have been plasma outbursts from our own Sun, or the close flyby of an electrically charged space object. We just do not know; but the forts sitting at high elevations could have served as lightning rods, attracting intense electrical currents that resulted in their vitrification. In 1962 astrophysicist Thomas Gold (1920-2004) speculated on the possibility of intense plasma outbursts affecting the surface of Earth. Four decades later plasma physicist Anthony L. Peratt followed up on Gold’s suggestion, finding evidence of powerful ancient plasma phenomena in the form of petroglyphs – records engraved by the ancients on rocks of the figures and patterns they apparently observed in the skies. Building on the work of Gold and Peratt, I suggested that the enigmatic Easter Island rongorongo texts record plasma phenomena millennia ago, and in fact there may have been a major plasma event that struck Earth in circa 9700 BCE which initiated the final melting that brought the last ice age to an end. A series of strong plasma events may have wreaked havoc on Earth during the millennia immediately following the end of the last ice age. The incredibly sophisticated, and incredibly early, site of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey dates to around 10,000 to 9000 BCE and was intentionally buried by 8000 BCE. Was it buried in response to, perhaps as a way to try to protect it from, a major plasma event? If major plasma phenomena impacted Earth in ancient times, where did the plasma come from? Although plasma events could conceivably be generated by a number of different types of astronomical phenomena, perhaps a close flyby of a comet or other object, or by plasma or cosmic ray particles originating from outside of our solar system, Gold and Peratt look to our Sun. Indeed even in historical times the Sun has shown major instabilities, known as solar storms, and has occasionally thrown off chunks of plasma, referred to as coronal mass ejections. The most severe occurrence in modern times is the 1859 Carrington Event when, over several days in late August and early September, intense solar flares and magnetic storms took place and two coronal mass ejections released by the Sun collided with Earth. The Carrington Event was certainly not an isolated phenomenon, and probably not particularly large by astrophysical standards; I firmly believe similar but more powerful and destructive events happened in the past, and will happen again in the future. Solar activity over the last 11,450 years has been reconstructed in various manners, particularly using 10Be and 14C data from ice cores. Among other factors, solar activity can be gauged based on sunspot numbers (higher numbers of sunspots correlate with higher solar activity) which in turn can be reconstructed for the past using the isotope data (primarily 14C and 10Be). Such studies show a number of minima and maxima in solar activity. Maxima occur, for instance (looking at the two millennia just after the end of the last ice age) at circa 9375 BCE (as far back as the data goes in the particular study), 8915 BCE, 8350 BCE, 8030 BCE, 7850 BCE, 7780 BCE, and 7660 BCE while minima occur at various points.
