Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid simply returning a country. Return only the location, including the corresponding country and continent. Here's the information:

Introduction
→ Southwest of the Iberian peninsula: key territory of major geoarchaeological interest, as well as
a reservoir of biodiversity and a wildlife refuge area during the Holocene.
→ Unstable bioclimatic conditions in the Western Mediterranean: further studies are still
required to understand how climate events and natural hazards impacted societies and environment.
→ The RV Meteor cruise M-152 retrieved 19 vibracores and 4 gravity cores along the Algarve coast.
The core GeoB23519-01 was taken 65 m below present sea level and recovered 365 cm of
sediment. Five potential event layers were identified over the last 11 ka cal BP and, at least two of
them, are related to tsunami deposits (ca. 3700* cal BP and 1779 cal AD).
*There is a mistake in the abstract. It is 3700 cal BP instead of 4370 cal BP.

PALYNOLOGY:
- ca. 160 cm, before the palaeo-tsunami:
· Continentalization (↑ high-mountain pines).
· Dry conditions (↑ xerophytic elements).
· Moisture decrease (↓ mesophilous woodlands; ↓ riparian trees; ↓ Isoetes).
· Evidence of anthropization decrease (↓ anthropogenic-nitrophilous herbs).
- Pollen hiatus during the ca. 3.7 ka cal BP tsunami layer (sterile samples) vs no impact of the AD 1755 tsunami in pollen
preservation.
FORAMINIFERAL STUDY:
- Palaeo-tsunami:
· Less diversity and density.
· Planktonic foraminifera decreasing from the basis to the top of the event layer.
· Transport of shallow water taxa towards deeper areas → tsunami backwash.
· Taphonomic features like scratches due to turbidite-like flow towards deeper waters.
- No input of the AD 1755 tsunami backwash.

- Clear impact of the 4.2 ka cal BP climate event on the vegetation and human groups / land use.
- Impact of EWEs:
· Algarve offshore ~ 3.7-3.6 ka cal BP → unknown → no pollen preservation
· Doñana National Park ~ 4.2-4 ka cal BP → clear impact / also climate event
- Coastal geomorphology determines the EWEs impact on the landscape and coastal settlements.
- Marine cores do not mirror that impact at the same level than continental cores do.
- Currently working on:
· Accurate age-depth model to correlate all the dated cores.
· Palynological analysis of the deepest sections of the core.
