Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid simply returning a country. Return only the location, including the corresponding country and continent. Here's the information:
