Based on the following information related to a certain kind of event or occurrence, I want you to provide me the geographically closest present day location. It could be a city, a beach, an island, etc. But I want you to be as specific as possible based on the information I give you. Avoid simply returning a country. Return only the location, including the corresponding country and continent. Here's the information:

Basic description of event: Disappearance of Sarasvati & Dṛṣadvati Rivers

Basic location of event: India

Specific data/information/context related to event: The Date of the Disappearance of Rigvedic Sarasvati River and Post-Vedic Sarasvati River

Numerous scientific studies have been undertaken for mapping and dating of the palaeochannels of Sarasvati River. Recent studies of Great Ran of Kachch and Nd & Sr isotopic measurements suggest that a distinct source of water (Sarasvati River) may have been present before 10000 years. Later in Holocene, under a drying climate, sediments from the Thar Desert probably choked the signature of an independent Sarasvati like river. The new research undertaken by IIT, Kanpur and Imperial College, London has also concluded that Sarasvati River might have been dried up around 8000-12000 years ago. Based on these scientific findings, IITK's Prof Rajiv Sinha and his team claimed that "Our paper clearly demolishes the age-old river-culture hypothesis that assumed that the disappearance of the river triggered the demise of the Harappan civilization. This has clearly been demonstrated by the large difference in age data between the demise of the river (8000-12000 years ago) and the peak of mature civilization 3000-4000 years ago." 

The study of IITK also suggests that between 15000 and 8000 years ago the Sutlej River avulsed (migrated) to its present day course to the northwest. The abandonment of the former course left a topographic low formed by the former channel in the landscape. The Dating of the sediments in the palaeochannels was done by IITK using a technique known as Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL). It may be noted that the OSL method is not an accurate method and therefore, the date arrived by the OSL method may be an underestimate of ~10%.

The Aryan Invasion Theory: The Final Nail in its Coffin (From a Chapter in "Advancements of Ancient India's Vedic Culture")  
Dwivendra Dubey  
The Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) is the idea that the Vedic people were not indigenous to the area of northern India, but were invaders from the Caucasus Mountain region that descended on India around 1500 BCE, and then wrote the Vedic literature and forced the natives to accept their culture. In writing this chapter I want to emphasize that this book is not about the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT), but we should at least include one chapter on it to show its place in discovering the real history of the development of ancient India and the origins of Vedic culture. In doing so, I acknowledge there have already been volumes written on this controversial topic, and on where the original homeland of the Indo Aryans might be. So anyone can read any of those books until one is nauseated with various viewpoints, but that is not what we are going to do here. Going into a long dissertation about how all the theories were developed and what evidence they found is the last thing I want to do. For all but the specialist researchers and readers, it would make for an extremely tedious book, at least more so than some may feel it is already. So, we are only going to summarize some of the most recent and concluding research that is available today. Let us remember that the idea that the Vedic Aryans came from outside of ancient India and entered the region to start what became the Vedic civilization is a foreign idea. There was never any record, either historical, textual or archeological, that supports this premise for an Aryan invasion. There also is no record of who would have been the invaders. The fact is that it is a theory that came from mere linguistic speculation which happened during the nineteenth century when very little archeological excavation had yet been done around India. There have been many researchers who have tried to study the linguistics of the people to gather an indication of where the original homeland of the Vedic Aryans was actually located. This was done to either try to uphold or refute the idea of the Aryan Invasion Theory. In my book, Proof of Vedic Culture's Global Existence, I dealt with linguistics and word similarities to a degree, but this topic, in spite of all the research, study, and books written on whatever findings were made, has done little to absolutely establish with clarity the original home of the Vedic Aryans. Some scholars have always felt that the linguistic evidence is not sufficient to draw definite conclusions where the homeland of the Vedic Aryans was located. Linguistics amongst some scholars have always been a speculative process, at best arriving at various conjectures about the origins of particular cultures and languages. Others have been even more dismissive of the idea of reconstructing a hypothetical language based on words that remain present in spoken languages thousands of years later. Thus, in trying to understand the Vedic Aryans and where their homeland may have been by analyzing some hypothetical Proto-Indo-European language that still has not been identified seems rather doubtful. At best, it may provide some basic hypothesis, which in reality may be most misleading. This also seems to say that there is little reason to hold the field of linguistics in such a high degree of respect, considering all the books that have been written that seem to use this process to determine so many conclusions, or conjectures, on the homeland of the Vedic Aryans. As a further comment to this issue, G. P. Singh relates, "They (proponents of the Aryan Invasion Theory) are divided in their opinion regarding the exact location of the said common home, the reason for which is not far to discover. The speakers of Aryan languages have been clubbed together as an Aryan race which never existed as such.
