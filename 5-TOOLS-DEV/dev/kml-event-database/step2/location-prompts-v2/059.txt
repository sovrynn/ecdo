Introduction In the British Isles, machair—low-altitude coastal landforms primarily composed of blown, often calcareous sand—is characteristically found in the southwestern Outer Hebrides, along the Atlantic seaboard of mainland Scotland and Ireland and in limited areas of coastal southwest England (Ritchie, 1967, 1979; Evans, 1979; Bassett and Curtis, 1985; Robertson-Rintoul and Ritchie, 1990). Gilbertson et al. (1999) presented a machair chronostratigraphy for the Outer Hebrides and reviewed models of its formation.

latter are considered during the analysis of the sedimentary sequences investigated here. Firstly, Ritchie (1966, 1979) proposed that rising Holocene relative sea levels resulted in the remobilisation inland of a finite volume of off-shore glacigenic and biogenic sand into dune ridges, the erosion of which resulted in the formation of machair. Significant differences in machair morphology encountered in the Uists, Outer Hebrides, were related to whether ground elevation rose or fell inland from the coastline (Ritchie, 1979). Sediment starvation of the coastal system eventually led to dune migration inland over back-dune freshwater marsh and pond habitats, with their associated sediments (marl and peat) ultimately reappearing on the seaward face of the dune in an intertidal position (Ritchie, 1985). Secondly, Mate (1992) believed that continuous production of off-shore biogenic carbonate sand would result in the consistent formation of machair through time. A chronology of machair formation was proposed for the Outer Hebrides by Ritchie (1979) based on morphology, stratigraphy and related horizons of anthropogenic occupation. However, locally variable stratigraphical sequences resulting from non-synchronous sand-blow events were later encountered in the archipelago... Keatinge and Dickson 1979; Hulme and Durno 1980; Birnie 1981; Bunting 1994) and stratigraphic analysis (geomorphology and lithostratigraphy) (e.g. Leinert and Keen 2000; de la Vega Leinert 2007) with some studies using macrofossils, beetles, molluscs, and organic content and even fewer studies using diatoms (e.g. Hulme and Shirriffs 1994; Bunting 1996; Birnie 2000; Leinert and Keen 2000; Whittington et al. 2003; Whittington et al. 2015). Most records are limited to the Bronze Age (from c. 4000 years BP) (Bunting et al., 2001; Downes, 1994; Hedges, 1974; Hedges, 1976; Keatinge and Dickson, 1979) and few in the Neolithic (from c. 6000 years BP) (Bates et al., 2016; Davidson et al., 1976; Keatinge and Dickson, 1979), and are single point reconstructions constrained to the archaeological point of interest. There are limited records that extend into the Mesolithic (Bunting, 1996; Edwards et al., 2005; Hulme and Durno, 1980; Keatinge and Dickson, 1979; Leinert and Keen, 2000; Moar, 1969; Whittington et al., 2003) and fewer that span as far as the Late Upper Palaeolithic (Birnie, 2000; Bunting, 1994; de la Vega Leinert, 2007; Hulme and Shirriffs, 1994; Whittington et al., 2003). There has been more recent published research on the palaeoenvironments of Orkney, however, most are concerned with sea levels (Teasdale et al., 2011), glaciation and isostatic uplift (Clark et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2008), storminess (Tisdall and McCulloch, 2013), and archaeology (Bates et al., 2013; Farrell et al., 2012).

Melanie Kingsbury View Intertidal peats, many of which contain remnants of prehistoric woodland surviving as submerged forest deposits, have long been known in sheltered bays across Orkney (e.g., Traill 1868; Traill Dennison 1893; Watt 1820; Wilson et al. 1935). The palaeoenvironmental and archaeological value of these coastal deposits has been well demonstrated across the UK (e.g., Bell 2007; Bicket and Tizzard 2015; Sidell and Haughey 2007; Timpany 2005), yet despite these early recordings in Orkney, only a handful of these sites have been the subject of palaeoenvironmental (de la Vega-Leinert et al. 2000; Keatinge and Dickson 1979) and archaeological (Buckland et al. 1998) investigation. More recent studies (e.g., Bates et al. 2013) have utilized these peats as relative sea-level (RSL) index points as part of a study into Holocene sea-level change on Orkney. The archaeological potential, and to a lesser degree, palaeoenvironmental potential of these deposits is still largely unknown, so when a substantial oak 'plank' was discovered stratified within intertidal peats in 2013 at the Bay of Ireland, Stenness, it raised many possibilities about what else may be held in such deposits. Previous radiocarbon dates taken from intertidal peats and submerged forests across Orkney indicate a probable Mesolithic to Neolithic date for this timber of between 4800 and 3000 cal BC (Buckland et al. 1998; de la Vega-Leinert et al. 2000; Rennie 2006). This unique discovery is the first prehistoric oak timber to be found in Orkney, with the discovery and recovery of organic (including wooden) artifacts from the Mesolithic period in Scotland and the UK as a whole still extremely rare (Brunning 2007). The oak timber was stratified within a bed of Phragmites peat, that also contained previously unrecorded submerged forest deposits (Figure 1). Due to the eroding nature of these coastal peats, a problem not unique to Orkney (e.g., Dawson 2006), it was decided that the timber should be recorded in situ in order to understand its stratigraphic relationship before being excavated and analyzed to establish a robust chronology. This also provided an opportunity to undertake a detailed investigation into the surrounding peat deposits to look for any evidence of human-environmental interactions that took place during the period of the timber's deposition, as well as to investigate the character of the submerged forest.

View Today, both Skara Brae and the Skaill Bay butchery site occupy an exposed coastal location on the south side of the bay. However, during the Late Neolithic, the opening to the current bay was closed, resulting in the presence of a substantial loch (Vega-Leinert et al 2000). Skara Brae and the butchery site would at this time have been positioned adjacent to the south-eastern lochside. A series of environmental changes during the Mid Holocene in the Bay of Skaill have been identified (Vega-Leinert et al 2000) and are summarised here together with the accompanying dates. Freshwater marsh was formed by streams flowing into a natural depression on the glacial sediments from 6550 ± 80 bp (5590-5305 cal bc). Containment, closure and red deer Article Full-text available

View Relative sea level has risen some 10m since the early Holocene to reach its present position around 4000 cal BP (Bates et al. 2012; Bates et al. 2016). Although the local impact varies with individual conditions, such as the occasional presence (and breaching) of coastal barriers (De la Vega-Leinert et al. 2000), the overall impact has been to reduce the amount of land and increase the number of islands and sea-crossings. Work by Farrell and others on pollen cores from around the West Mainland of Orkney has recorded a complex history of woodland cover in Orkney including periods of arboreal decline both before and after the arrival of farming (summed up in Farrell et al. 2012 related to environmental change such as changes in rainfall. This is documented at several sites including the Bay of Skaill (de la Vega-Leinert et al. 2000) and People and Landscape at the Heart of Neolithic Orkney Article Full-text available

View Periods of sand drift in the Outer Hebrides are dated to 6900-6400, 5800-4200 and 3800-3300 cal. a BP (Fig. 7G; Gilbertson et al. 1999). A more broadly defined period of sand movement from ~7000 to 4800 years ago has also been suggested for the Outer Hebrides (de la Vega Leinert et al. 2000). On the northern tip of Scotland, intervals of sand movement were dated to between 6310 and 4340 cal. a BP and 4000 to 2690 cal. a BP (Fig. 7H; McIlvenny et al. 2013).

View Studies since 1993 of storm impacts. Many local studies since 1993 have focused on dunes (Gilbertson et al. 1999; De la Vega-Leinert et al. 2000; Dawson et al. 2002; Dawson et al. 2004; Wilson 2002; Sommerville 2003; Sommerville et al. 2003; Sommerville et al., 2007) or on documentary evidence for historic storms (e.g., Hickey 1997; Dawson et al. 2007; Hansom et al. 2008).

Jan 2018 David Smith Natasha L.M. Barlow Sarah L. Bradley David Long View Observational records tend to span the past few hundred years and are based on air temperature (Dawson et al., 2003), sea surface temperature (Hurrell, 1995) and wind speed (Clarke and Rendell, 2009; Dawson et al., 2010). In Europe and the North East Atlantic, proxy measures for increased wind strength include aeolian sand influx (de la Vega-Leinert et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 2002; Sommerville et al., 2003; de Jong et al., 2006; Clarke and Rendell, 2009; Tisdall et al., 2013), over-wash deposits in coastal lagoons (Sabatier et al., 2012), cliff-top storm deposits left by extreme waves (Hansom and Hall, 2009), marine records reflecting windblown current strength and storm deposits (Hass, 1996; and Na + from the Greenland ice cores (Dawson et al., 2003). Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of North Atlantic storminess tend to span from the mid-Holocene to the present, so high-resolution records on a millennial timescale (10^3 a) are an important goal to gauge longer-term trends and better understand Holocene climate variability. 8000 years of North Atlantic storminess reconstructed from a Scottish peat record: Implications for Holocene atmospheric circulation patterns in Western Europe Article Full-text available
