Okay okay.

So what I can do is.

Use ChatGPT to process these.

Step 0: Clean the data

Step 1: Scrape the data from the links and save it to txt files

Step 2: Ask ChatGPT to come up with the most accurate present day location possible.

Step 3: Then I can use Google Earth API to get a lat/lon.

Step 4: Then I can include the title and the link in the marker description and generate a KML.

# Step 0

Removed:
- all global locations
- all recent events that were before 1200 BC

Add links

# Step 1

How do I not get blocked?
