The First Dark Age in Egypt 7 Bibliography 24
INTRODUCTION
In the history of the ancient Near East two strik-
ing Dark Ages have occurred. They occurred more
or less simultaneously (within the limits of current
dating accuracy) over a wide area extending at least
from Greece to Mesopotamia and Elam, from Ana-
tolia to Egypt, and probably beyond. In Egypt,
where the chronology is best established, the first
Dark Age began around 2200 B.C., when at the end
of Dynasty VI Egypt, until then a very stable so-
ciety, with seeming suddenness fell into anarchy.
About the same time the Akkadian Empire disin-
tegrated. Byblos and a number of other sites in Syr-
ia and Palestine were destroyed by fire and some
were abandoned for a time. Troy II, the wealthy
citadel of Schliemann's gold treasure, was destroyed
by fire and rebuilt on only a very shabby scale.
Lerna and other prosperous Argolid centers were
burned and their destruction was followed by
greatly lessened prosperity. In western and south-
ern Anatolia "the end of the E.B. [Early Bronze]
2 period is marked . . . by a catastrophe of such
magnitude as to remain unparalleled until the very
end of the Bronze Age" (Mellaart, 1962); wide-
spread destruction is followed by a general decline
in material culture and a decrease by about 75 per-
cent in the number of known settlements. We
1 I wish to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Nicholas B.
Millet (Harvard University) for his interest, encouragement, and
numerous helpful discussions throughout the course of this
study; his critical reading of the semi-final draft and advice
on the various translations was an aid of particular value be-
cause I do not myself have a reading knowledge of ancient
Egyptian. The various theories set forth herein are, however,
solely my responsibility.
I wish to thank also Professors Sterling Dow (Harvard Uni-
may probably include also the decline of the Indus
Valley civilization. The radiocarbon dates of Phase
F (mature Harappan) lie between 2100 and 1900
B.C. (Dales 1965; half-life 5730), with an average
of 1975 B.C. from 12 measurements. But when these
dates are corrected for the systematic error in C- 14
dates of this period, as determined by Suess (1967)
and by Ralph and Michael (1969), the dates fall
between about 2500 and 2250 B.C.
The second Dark Age began around 1200 B.C.
It was marked by the disappearance of the Hittite
Empire of Anatolia and the collapse of the My-
cenaean civilization of Greece. About the same
time, or a little later, Egypt went into a prolonged
decline, while Babylonia and Assyria were also
weak for most of the 1100'S and 1000'S.
When we turn to the revised Cambridge An-
cient History (CAH) or other modern studies for
explanation, we find numerous references to evi-
dence of destruction by fire. The destruction is
often attributed to invasions by barbarians about
whom little is known, however, and for whose
activities the archaeological evidence is often mea-
ger or nonexistent. Moreover Adams (1968) has
pointed out that the interpretation of seemingly
violent destruction and discontinuous layering in a
habitation site is more complex and ambiguous
versity), Karl W. Butzer (University of Chicago), and Rhys
Carpenter, each of whom kindly read the semi-final draft and
made suggestions and comments which enabled me to improve
the manuscript.
The chronology followed in this paper is that of the revised
Cambridge Ancient History, particularly Smith (1962) and
H~yes ( 1961). References (with a few exceptions in the text)

and by date.

than previously recognized, and cannot be con-
sidered clear evidence of either intermittent occu-
pation or enemy attack. He thus urges more cau-
tion in inferring invasions when there is no clear
positive evidence for the presence of invaders. But
even where it is clear that barbarian invasions
did occur, we are left with the question of whether
they are a sufficient cause or explanation for the
destruction of a number of apparently powerful
and prosperous states, and why so many different
barbarian tribes were stirred to attack centers of
civilization at about the same time. Anyone or two
of the above disasters, standing alone, might be
sufficiently explained by political factors. But the
concentration in time of so many disasters and the
universal absence of prosperity throughout the area
strongly suggest a common underlying cause.
Of "historical truth," Frankfort (1951) wrote
that a concept whereby "many seemingly unre-
lated facts are seen to acquire meaning and coher-
ence is likely to represent a historical reality." It is
the thesis of this study that the two Dark Ages,
and the numerous disasters in the periods c. 2200-
2000 and c. 1200-900 B.C., can be given coherence
and can all be explained at once by a single primary
cause. The cause I postulate as "historical reality"
is drought-widespread, severe, and prolonged-
lasting for several decades and occurring more or
less simultaneously over the entire eastern Medi-
terranean and adjacent lands. This is not to deny
the significance of contemporary political and so-
cial factors; it is, however, to assert that a climatic-
economic deterioration of sufficient magnitude can
set in motion forces beyond the strength of any
society to withstand.
Such an hypothesis has indeed already been ad-
vanced by Rhys Carpenter (1966) for the Second
Dark Age, c. 1200-900 B.C.; his argument is based
primarily on study of the decline of Mycenaean
Greece and the Hittite Empire. And in a subse-
quent paper I plan to discuss this period with
primary reference to Egypt.
The present paper will examine the evidence for
the hypothesis that the First Dark Age of Egypt,
the so-called First Intermediate Period, was brought
on by a similar prolonged and intense drought.
Later papers will examine the evidence from other
lands, but there are several advantages in beginning
with Egypt:
First, Egypt was in ancient times a relatively
isolated civilization, generally unified and free of
civil war and, because of its formidable and well-
defined natural frontiers, of foreign invasions. Thus
we have here the best chance of tracing the inter-
action of man and his natural environment, and
making plausible inferences from the level of eco-
nomic prosperity about fluctuations in the resources
provided by the natural environment.
Second, the chronology of Egypt, in the historical
period from c. 3100 B.C. onward, is known with
greater precision than that of any other ancient
land. Thus whatever climatic fluctuations we de-
duce from Egyptian history will be relatively well
dated. Moreover we can test them by looking for
contemporaneous patterns, that is for fluctuations
in the direction of greater aridity or of greater mois-
ture, in other lands; and if similar sequences can
be found, there is a possibility of improving the
chronology of other lands.
Third, Egypt was a literate society, so that we
may hope to find texts bearing on the conditions
of the tin1es, and it is in fact the discussion of such
texts which forms the main section of this paper.
Mesopotamia also offers the advantage of literacy,
but its chronology is less certain; more importantly,
the picture there is obscured by frequent warfare
between the cities, the lack of natural frontiers,
recurrent invasions on a large scale, and a greater
complexity in climatic factors. In Egypt we have to
do essentially with the volume of the Nile, and
particularly of its annual flood; that is, we have a
single climatic factor to consider, rather than the
combination of river-floods and rainfall characteris-
tic of Mesopotamia.
It may appear a bizarre hypothesis, even to those
sympathetic to the concept of climate fluctuations
as a factor in history, to link drought in the lands
of the eastern Mediterranean, which derive their
moisture mainly from winter rainfall, with Egypt
which depends for its water on the Nile River-
that is on the rainfall over central Africa (vVhite
Nile) and on the summer monsoon rains over the
East African highlands (Blue Nile). Nevertheless
there is a growing body of evidence that such a
correlation does at times occur, and indeed that it
has occurred over the past century. Studies by
Kraus (1954; 1955 a,b; 195 6) and by Butzer (1961)
indicate that the average rainfall was less in many
regions in the first four decades of this century
than in the late decades of the nineteenth century.
This decline occurred over a wide area of the Near
East and North Africa, including both the northern
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 3
and southern fringes of the Sahara, northwest
India (Jaipur) and Pakistan (Quetta), and the
drainage basin of the Nile. The decrease in average
rainfall occurred also in a number of other lands
far beyond our present interest, such as parts of
Australia (Kraus 1954) and the Dust Bowl of the
United States (Butzer 1961). The change over
from the moister to the drier climate regime
occurred quite abruptly in many places between
1893 and 19Â°8, with the exact date depending upon
the region concerned. For the Nile, the annual
average volume of water passing Aswan was about
25 percent less for the years 1899-1957 than for the
years 1871-1898, with a clear and abrupt shift to
the drier regime in 1899 (see Kraus 1956). "With-
out the tempering effect of dams and barrages,
agriculture in the Nile Valley would have suffered
badly" (Butzer 1961 :50); and as a consequence
of the widespread decline in rainfall, "Droughts
of economic importance plagued the Levantine area
in the 1920S and the entire Near East in the 1930S.
Lake Aksehir in Central Anatolia dried out en-
tirely in 1933. Similar conditions can be noted for
the peripheries of the Sahara." And similarly in the
Red Sea Hills of eastern Egypt, "vegetation was
. . . more common prior to the desiccation that
has taken place during the present century" (Trig-
ger 1965:11).
This evidence from the past century makes it
more plausible that most of the Near East and the
Nile catchment basin were afflicted more or less
simultaneously by some decades of severe drought
at certain times in the past.
It is the prime thesis of my investigation, indeed,
that a widespread drought, considerably more
severe than the present one, occurred at intervals
in the past and that it was precisely these droughts
which precipitated the Dark Ages of Ancient His-
tory. Even a moderate drought can bring famine to
the marginally productive lands on the edges of
the deserts and can thereby motivate tribal migra-
tions and invasions of the better-watered river val-
leys, a phenomenon discussed by numerous scholars
(e.g. Brooks 1949). But a severe drought, such as
postulated in this paper, and by Carpenter (1966),
will bring crop failures and famine and varying
degrees of civil disorder even to the richer lands.
If sufficiently severe, a drought may not only incite
invasions from marginal lands but may weaken the
power of the major states to resist invasion, and in
2 But unfortunately in some respects obsolete.
some cases may even plunge them into a Dark
Age without any serious foreign threat. In the case
of Egypt the evidence' which we shall consider
presently favors the latter condition.
The first of the postulated Great Droughts in
the Ancient Near East occurred from about 2200
to 2000 B.C. More precisely, as we shall see from a
detailed consideration of the historical evidence,
it occurred in two parts, at least in Egypt-and
almost certainly in Iraq-the first around 2180 to
2150, and the second for a few years around 2000
B.C. In Egypt the crisis was not a failure of local
rainfall, which was already at a very low level, but
a severe failure of the annual floods of the Nile. It
is as if Nature set two great exclamation points to
emphasize the end of the Neolithic Wet Phase
(NWP); or, to reverse Eliot, the NWP ended not
with a whimper but with a bang.
Prehistoric Climate. A brief review of the earlier
climate fluctuations may be useful before we take
up the Dark Age itself, to put our central event in
its paleoclimatic setting. It is now a fact beyond
dispute that climate has been subject to change
since the earliest times known to geologists. Be-
cause geology is a relatively young science, how-
ever, this fact has been recognized for only about
a century; and at first only the larger fluctuations,
the extremes of Ice Age' and Interglacial, were
recognized. But soon geologists found evidence
that ice sheets, both in their expansion and their
recession, were subject to interruption-that is,
neither advances nor recessions proceeded smoothly
and linearly, but each was from time to time in-
terrupted by a reversal of the primary trend, a
reversal lasting some hundreds to thousands of
years. The Pleistocene Ice Age, now thought to
cover some two to three million years, has been
studied extensively in northern and central Europe
and in North America, and much attention in
Europe particularly has been given to the larger
fluctuations that accompanied the retreat of the
latest (Wiirm) ice sheet. We obtain an impression
of damped oscillations, of gradually diminishing
amplitude and duration, over the past ten to fifteen
thousand years.
Although many details and dates remain to be
fixed, it has been established beyond any reasonable
doubt that significant fluctuations in climate have
occurred in post-glacial times in northern and cen-
tral Europe (see Brooks 1949, for a convenient 2

semi-popular summary; for more recent, and more
technical, reviews, see Starkel 1966 and Frenzel
1966). It is, to me at least, a priori incredible that
the climate should not also have fluctuated over all
other areas of the earth. This, of course, is not to
claim that there is anything a priori obvious about
the direction and amplitude, or even the timing,
of such fluctuations, which cannot be inferred by
analogy, but must be determined from paleo-eco-
logical, geological, and archaeological evidence.
The Mediterranean Basin, the Near East, and
northern and central Africa, which are the regions
of concern to us here, have received much less
attention from natural scientists, primarily, it
would seem, because the evidence is more subtle
and difficult to detect. A number of isolated studies
of particular areas were made, but only within
the past decade have the relatively meager available
facts been synthesized into a coherent picture for
the area as a whole. This synthesis was made by
Karl W. Butzer (1958, etc.), on whose work most
of the following summary of climate variation is
based. One of Butzer's most important and inter-
esting contributions is his clarification of the rela-
tion in time between the larger subtropical and
European climate changes.
For some time it has been recognized that cen-
tral Africa and the margins of the deserts had a
number of pluvial periods, but the relation in time
of these tropical and subtropical wet periods to the
northern ice sheets was much disputed. The prob-
ably most popular view held the two to be con-
temporaneous, and considered that the increased
wetness in lower latitudes, particularly in Africa,
was a simple and direct consequence of mid-lati-
tude storm tracks being deflected southward by the
presence of the ice sheets. Thus the maximum
subtropical wetness would coincide with the maxi-
mal extent of the ice sheets. And indeed a number
of scholars, beginning with Childe (19 29 :42, 46)
and Toynbee (1934:304f), have linked the develop-
ment of the great river-valley civilizations to the
challenge of a gradually increasing desiccation fol-
lowing upon the recession of the ice sheets.
However this view is no longer tenable. After the
work of Blidel and of Schaefer, it now appears
that only the expansion phase had heavy rainfall,
while the full and late glacial phases were relatively
dry in middle-latitude Eurasia. Recent work also
indicates that the last major pluvial in Africa is to
be dated to the early Wlirm period, and that this
was a period of advance and growth for the cen-
tral-east African mountain glaciers (Butzer 1963),
although the most recent work (Butzer and Han-
sen 1968) indicates that the actual situation has
many complexities. And finally, Butzer (1963)
found that the period of glacial advance was the
pluvial period in the Mediterranean Basin as well,
whereas the terminal phases of the Pleistocene were
quite dry. Thus he concluded (ibid. p. 212) that
"subtropical pluvials cannot be genetically inter-
preted as secondary effects of the presence of con-
tinental ice sheets in higher latitudes . . . [but] ...
must be attributed to a primary change of the gen-
eral circulation, presumably in immediate associa-
tion with glacial advance in higher latitudes."
Contrary to the views of Childe (1929), Toynbee
(1934), and most subsequent scholars who have
mentioned prehistoric climate, including Carpenter
(19 66 )-but excluding Hayes (1964), Trigger
(1965), and the revised CAH (Butzer 1965)-the
lands of the Near East and northern Africa were
already as dry or drier 15,000 years ago than they
are today. Recent evidence from Lake Zeribar in
Iran, from the lowlands of Macedonia, and from
the mountains of northwestern Greece, indicates
that much of this region was then apparently a tree-
less landscape, perhaps resembling the semi-arid
steppe of modern Anatolia (Wright 1968).
Since that time numerous fluctuations have
occurred between relatively wetter and drier con-
ditions, on a time scale of hundreds to thousands
of years. In amplitude, and hence in terms of geo-
logical effects, these fluctuations are small and
difficult to detect in the arid and semi-arid lands
of interest to us here. However fluctuations that
are too small to leave clear geological evidence can
still be large enough to produce highly significant
ecological effects, which may be reflected in archae-
ological evidence.
Early in his studies Butzer (1958) noted a curi-
ous parallelism between moisture trends in Europe
and in the Near East. Every fluctuation to greater
or lesser precipitation, the duration of which is
measured in millennia, has been more or less paral-
lel in Europe and in lower latitudes. In addition to
the parallelism between Europe and the Near East,
Butzer (1961) emphasizes that the major paleo-
climatic shifts north and south of the Sahara have
been, insofar as evidence is available, synchronous
and not alternative. That is, the evidence (see also
Kraus 19ssa:202-204) supports an expanding and
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 5
contracting Sahara Desert. Thus the ultimate me-
teorological explanation, Butzer points out, must
be sought in terms of a mechanism that will en-
large or shrink the extension of the dry trade-wind
circulation zone, which is responsible for the sub-
tropical deserts, in both latitudinal directions at
once.
The existence of a Neolithic Wet Phase, and a
preceding very dry period, has been suspected in
Egypt for several decades by various scholars, in-
cluding Caton-Thompson and Gardner, Huzayyin,
and Murray (1951), but in the absence of any
systematic study of the overall evidence, there was
little agreement on the duration, extent, and char-
acter of the NWP (Butzer 1958). It is outside the
scope of the present study to review in any detail
the evidence for the NWP in the Near East (see
Butzer 1958; 1959b,c; 1965), a period which cor-
responds approximately to the relatively warm and
wet Climatic Optimum or Atlantic Period (see
Brooks 1949; Starkel 1966) in northern Europe.
For northern Africa much of the evidence is ar-
chaeological, such as neolithic artifacts found in
desert areas where man cannot now live, rock
drawings of animal species that require at least a
savanna type of vegetation, and fossil roots and
tree stumps in wadi bottoms and the low desert
where no trees grow today.
Decline of the Neolithic Wet Phase. "Overall,
the Nubian and Egyptian evidence indicates a
complex moist interval beginning before c. 7000
B.C., interrupted by some drier spells and terminat-
ing in stages between 2900 and 2350 B.C." (Butzer
1966:75). These stages have been documented
(Butzer 1959c) by indirect archaeological evidence,
including a study of the relative frequencies of
various species of animals appearing in rock draw-
ings, tomb and temple wall reliefs, and other art
forms. At this time in northern Europe we have
a transition to the Sub-Boreal period, which "may
be characterized as warm but rather dry, with con-
siderable variations in humidity ...." The study
of lake levels gives evidence for "the occurrence of
great oscillations in precipitation," as does also the
periodic desiccation of peat bogs (Starkel 19 66 :27).
An interesting point for the present study is the
extent to which the time-synchronism of wet and
dry periods holds, or held in earlier times, over
shorter time periods-periods of decades to cen-
turies. The data on these smaller fluctuations are
obscure and will remain so at least until the sys-
tematic errors (Suess 1967; Ralph and Michael
1969) have been fully determined and corrected
for, or other more accurate methods of dating can
be developed. We should nonetheless regard it as
encouraging if a severe dry spell were found to
occur in Europe in the same century as that for
which we are postulating one in the Near East.
Such may well be the case, for Brooks (1949:296f)
cites evidence, from lake levels and peat bogs, for
unusually dry conditions in central Europe around
2300-2000 and 1200-1000 B.C., although modern pol-
len studies (Frenzel 1966) cast doubt upon this
picture. However this may eventually be resolved,
conditions in Europe have no necessary bearing on
the validity of our conclusions about conditions in
Egypt.
Butzer considers that the NWP rains over Egypt
had pretty well declined to their modern low level
by the beginning of Dynasty VI, c. 2350 B.C. This
conclusion is based in part on a change at this
time in the character of hunting and desert scenes
depicted on tomb and temple reliefs, a change both
in the game hunted and in the background land-
scape. There appears also to have been a general
exodus from the Libyan Desert in Dynasty VI
times, evidenced by the cessation of rock paintings
and the abandonment of Neolithic sites, together
with the appearance, according to O. H. Myers, of
Tehenu Libyans in the Nile Valley (Butzer 1958).
The specter of famine first clearly appears to-
wards the end of Dynasty V, when a well-known
relief from the causeway of the Pyramid of Unis
depicts a group of severely emaciated people, evi-
dently dying of hunger (Drioton 1942; Smith
1965 :pl. 48B) . Unfortunately no inscriptions have
survived to reveal the circumstances of this scene,
and nothing is known of either the nationality of
the starving people or the cause of their plight-
whether a failure of the Nile floods (an unlikely
event for the King to wish to commemorate) or
the ending of the NWP rains, which drove starving
desert-dwellers to seek refuge in the Nile Valley.
It is not unlikely that the decline of the Early
Bronze 2 culture in Greece and in Anatolia set in
with the ending of the NWP, particularly in
regions where many settlements were permanently
abandoned, as in western and southern Anatolia
(Mellaart 1962). To support more than speculation,
of course, much additional study is needed. We
may note, however, that four pieces of charcoal
from the House of Tiles at Lerna (late EH II)
6 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
give an average radiocarbon date of 2126 B.C. (from
Weinberg 1965; half-life 5730); but this becomes
c. 2500 B.C. when corrected for systematic error (see
Suess 1967; and Ralph and Michael 1969). Also
possibly relevant is the evidence (Wright 1968) for
a reduction in percentage of pine pollen around
Pylos shortly after 2000 B.C., and evidence for a
reduction in the beech-fir forest of northwestern
Turkey, dated to around 2000 B.C., changes which
might "reflect either a change to a drier climate or
deforestation." The dates here are a little late, but
they are also quite uncertain (VIright, personal
communication), so that the changes could well
reflect the ending of the NWP.
But in Egypt the Old Kingdom civilization con-
tinued, under Dynasty VI, to flourish for some ISO
years after the ending of the NWP. Most Egyptolo-
gists agree that the Pyramid complex of King
Neferkare Pepi II, the last major monument of the
Old Kingdom, exhibits the same high quality of
craftsmanship as its predecessors and gives no hint
of the Dark Age soon to engulf all aspects of
Egyptian civilization. Moreover it appears that the
climate of northeastern Africa remained severely
arid, probably averaging slightly less rainfall than
today, for at least some fifteen centuries, during
which time Egypt had two periods of high civiliza-
tion and three ages of decline.
This serves only to emphasize once again the
well-known dependence of Egypt upon the Nile.
Without a failure of the floods, it seems unlikely
that the ending of the NWP would have caused
Egypt more than some inconvenience and local
disturbances, when desert nomads of necessity
sought to settle in the Valley. Inscriptions indicate
that many of them did settle in the Valley, find-
ing employment with the army as mercenaries
(Breasted 1906 :311; Borchardt 1905), increasing
the population and adding to the potential for
trouble in any famine that might occur.
The Nile. A few words on the annual Nile
floods may be useful here. Because rainfall over all
but the northern Delta has long been rare and
irregular, Egyptian farmers have depended for at
least some 5000 years upon the annual flood of the
Nile River to water their fields and prepare the
soil for cultivation. The amount of any particular
inundation-at least before the building of the
modern system of dams and barrages-determined
whether that year would bring plenty or famine
or something intermediate. These annual floods are
the direct consequence of the summer monsoon
rainfall over the catchment basin of the Blue Nile
and the Atbara in the highlands of Ethiopia. The
maximum level of the flood waters in Egypt thus
provides a measure of the amount of this rainfall.
According to Hayes (1964), in Middle Egypt the
average difference between high and low water is
22' (6.7 m.), with a yearly variation that depends
on the volume of the equatorial rains; 4-5' ( 1.2-
1.5 m.) below average is a "bad Nile" and in
antiquity a succession of these usually resulted in
crop failures and famine, while a flood of 30'
(9 m.) or more would cause widespread destruc-
tion.
Deposits south of Wadi HaIfa suggest that flood
levels in early predynastic times were about 10 m.
higher than today, that they declined in an oscilla-
tory way to about 5 m. above today in early dynas-
tic times, and to the present level by the time of
the New Kingdom (Trigger 1965:31). It is hoped
that the present study, in this and subsequent
papers (now including Bell 1970), will provide
additional details on the flood levels in historical
times.
Fluctuations in climate during the past 4000
years have generally been either too small in ampli-
tude or too short in duration to leave behind much
geological evidence, as Butzer (1958, 1961) points
out, so that it becomes increasingly necessary to
resort to archaeological and literary sources, as we
shall do in the main section of this paper. But on
the fringelands of deserts the drifting of sand is a
particularly sensitive indicator of changes in aridity
and in aeolian activity. In Middle Egypt, Butzer
(1959a,c) found evidence that a chain of dunes
from the western desert invaded the valley and
covered the alluvium with several meters of sand
over a stretch about 175 km. in length and o.s to
3.5 km. in width. These fossil dunes are now cov-
ered by a few meters of mud, deposited mainly
between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 300. The dune in-
vasion was facilitated by weaker Nile floods and
consequent shrinkage of the floodplain, as well as
by increased aeolian activity and by an eastward
retreat of the Bahr Yusef, a secondary branch of
the Nile in Middle Egypt which drains into the
Fayum lake. The dunes cannot be dated precisely,
but a number of passages in the literary evidence
to be examined presently, indicate that they were
actively invading during the First Intermediate
Period. A knowledge of their existence clarifies the
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 7
meaning of a number of otherwise rather enig-
matic passages.
Although the adequacy of the Nile flood is the
main determinant of Egypt's prosperity, there are
also phrases in the ancient texts, as we shall see,
which seem to indicate that the low-water level was
at times abnormally low, which in turn implies a
deficiency of rainfall over sources of the White
Nile in east-central Africa. This is not unlikely, for
Brooks (1949) points out that in the records of the
Nile floods available from A.D. 641 to 1800 there is
a fair correlation between low-water level and flood
height, although the low-water levels show the
more violent fluctuations. Brooks' conclusion de-
rives from his analysis of the tables of low- and
high-water levels published by Toussoun (1925).
Toussoun's volume also contains a chronological
list of quotations on the level of the Nile and re-
lated events, compiled from Arab authors. Several
times in years of abnormally low floods there is
mention also of a remarkably low level of the
"old waters" or pre-flood Nile. And conversely
there is a tendency for the old waters to be high
before a very large flood. More important, one
obtains from these quotations also an impression
that the total volume of flood water fluctuates more
than the height of the flood. One frequently reads
that the flood attained a normal height, then de-
clined at once and there was famine, or at least
scarcity, in Egypt.
THE FIRST DARK AGE IN EGYPT
It is now widely believed (Hayes 1961, 1962b;
Wilson 1956; Gardiner 1961) that the real Dark
Age lasted only some 20-25 years, from the end of
Dynasty VI to the start of Dynasty IX, or from
about 2180 to 2160. Although the details remain
obscure and the primary cause open to dispute,
some aspects of the trouble which occurred at the
end of Dynasty VI seem clear: texts from the
period indicate that hardly any form of civil dis-
order was absent, ranging from strife between
districts, to looting and killing by infiltrating
Asiatics in the Delta, to individual crime run riot,
to revolution and social anarchy. Reference to
famine occurs in several texts. This fact has of
course been noted by a number of Egyptologists,
including those cited immediately above, and the
texts themselves have been intensively studied by
Vandier (1936). But none of these scholars gives
to famine the importance which I hope to show it
deserves as an explanation of the collapse of the
Old Kingdom. Butzer (1959c:68; 1965) points out
that a number of these documents refer to "famine
resulting from low Niles rather than from human
negligence," but analysis of the historical implica-
tions lay outside the scope of his investigation.
Although the real Dark Age was short, it had a
severely traumatic effect on the psyche of the Egyp-
tian educated classes; it produced a radical change
in values and outlook that can only reflect severe
shock and disillusionment. In the words of W. S.
Smith (1965 :87), "The earlier complacent sense of
stability had been rudely shaken, and Egypt never
regained that simple confidence in an enduring
continuity." The collapse of the Old Kingdom was
reflected in a new pessimistic literature "foreign to
the spirit and thought of earlier times" (Smith
1962 :55). This pessimistic literature, Cerny (195 2:
79) emphasizes, "was not the result of philosophical
meditation but a reflection of historical events . . .
and is in direct contradiction to the habitual opti-
mistic attitude of the Egyptians to life."
In the absence of unambiguous evidence, various
nonclimatic causes have been suggested for this
time of trouble; none of them however seem suffi-
cient to explain the magnitude of the effect.
The evidence for famine in ancient Egypt, given
by written texts, has been studied by Vandier
(1936), who points out that such evidence is scarce
because the Egyptians had not the habit of record-
ing their misfortunes for posterity. The principal
data for his study are the autobiographical inscrip-
tions of nomarchs (rulers of nomes or districts)
who, their personal vanity having overcome na-
tional pride, boasted of having fed their towns and
districts during the years of famine. Vandier found
very few documents on famine during the Old
Kingdom, and he attributed this to the strength
of the central government-which made it rela-
tively easy to store up large surpluses in years of
good Niles and dispense them in years of poor
Niles. I do not question the essential soundness of
this point, but would add two qualifications. First,
in these earlier times the provincial officials were
neither as independent in the content of their in-
scriptions nor as firmly attached to a particular
district. And second, as we have seen above, the
Neolithic Wet Phase was ending gradually during
the time of Dynasties V and VI. Thus while
famine probably did threaten from time to time in
the earlier years, the danger was unlikely to have
8 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
been as prolonged or severe, and was less likely
to have exhausted the stores of surplus grain.
Vandier lays great stress on the correlation be-
tween weakening of the authority of the central
government and the disastrous consequences of
insufficient floods. His study shows clearly that
such a correlation exists. The problem then is to
distinguish the symptoms of the disease from its
cause. Because of the meager evidence from these
troubled times, the question cannot be answered
with absolute certainty, but I hope to show that a
more consistent picture of "historical truth" results
from the hypothesis that prolonged insufficiency
of the floods destroyed a somewhat weakened cen-
tral government than vice versa. The claim can
indeed be made that there is no other adequate
explanation for the complete and seemingly sudden
disintegration of both the government and Egyp-
tian society that occurred at the end of the reign
of Pepi II of Dynasty VI, about 2180 B.C. In con-
sidering the ancient texts, I follow the viewpoint
of Gardiner (lEA I :36) that one should avoid
undue skepticism about ancient documents, and
should rather "use their statements, in the absence
of conflicting testimony, as the best available evi-
dence with regard to the periods of history to which
they relate."
Texts relating to the first great famine, c. 2180-
2130 B.C. Turning now to the written evidence
itself, we may first consider ANKHTIFI, who is
known from the inscriptions in his tomb at Mo'alla,
some 20 miles south of Luxor. This tomb has been
thoroughly studied by Vandier (1950) who is the
source for the quotations 3 which follow. Ankhtifi's
claim to his position is obscure-whether he held
it by birth or simply by his effective leadership in
troubled times-but he was nomarch of Hierakon-
polis and of Edfu, two of the southernmost nomes
of Upper Egypt. It is generally agreed that he lived
early in the First Intermediate Period (First Dark
Age), before Inyotef I of Thebes unified the South
and proclaimed himself King of Upper Egypt
about 2134 B.C. Inyotef would surely not have toler-
ated a hostile prince so near at hand, and Ankhtifi's
inscriptions describe a war he initiated against the
Theban nome, although the outcome is obscure.
Beckerath (1962, ,NES 21 :140) points out that
Ankhtifi must have lived at the virtual start of the
3 All quotations attributed to Vandier are my translations
from his French.
4 The correct printing of this term, I understand, is tzUJ
first Intermediate Period, because his inscriptions
give evidence that when he was young Abydos
was still the residence of an "Overseer of Upper
Egypt" who was recognized by the nomarchs.
Toward the end of Dynasty VIII that office had
lost all importance. Thus we may consider that
Ankhtifi's inscriptions provide a picture-probably
the best available-of conditions in the darkest part
of the Dark Age.
Most significant for our purpose is his vivid de-
scription of the famine that afHicted Upper Egypt:
... I fed/kept alive Hefat (Motalla), Hormer, and
(?) ... at a time when the sky was (in) clouds/
storm (igp) (was a tumult?) and the land was in
the wind (probably the clouds of a memorably se-
vere season or seasons of dust storms), (and when
everyone was dying) of hunger (bkr, the common
word for hunger) on this sandbank of Hell (tzw
of Apophis, a place in the underworld where the
dragon-serpent, Apophis, nightly threatened to de-
vour the sun god, Re).
As supporting evidence for the dust-storm inter-
pretation, we note Butzer's (1959b :66) finding that
at Hierakonpolis, nearby, a predynastic cemetery
was denuded by wind action, which removed up
to 2 m. of fairly resistant silt and exposed the buri-
als, probably some time after the end of Dynasty
VI. At Abydos, some 100 km. to the north, the
"funerary palace" of Queen Merneith of Dynasty I
suffered such intense denudation (and perhaps also
deliberate destruction) that its walls were reduced
to only a few courses of bricks, partly buried be-
neath a layer of sand by the time of Dynasty XII,
when a few small mastabas were constructed over
the ruins (B. J. Kemp 19 66, lEA 52).
Vandier considers the above-quoted sentence of
Ankhtifi's to be a particularly inspired masterpiece
of erudition, made up essentially of phrases from
the Pyramid Texts, aptly selected to describe the
current local troubles. The reference to the tzw of
Apophis is useful in helping to give us a clearer
idea of a key word, tzw,4 which occurs in several of
the famine texts of this period and merits some dis-
cussion. The word tzw is generally translated sand-
banks by Egyptologists. For the famine texts, Van-
dier (1936 :75) considers two hypotheses: either the
tzw are the sandbanks of the Nile that men culti-
vate at low waters and that are submerged through
with the t underlined. The line under the t, however, would
have to be set by hand and because the word occurs so fre-
quently it proved impractical to include the hand-set underline.
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 9
most of the inundation; or they are the higher
lands on each bank of the Nile susceptible to being
flooded for some weeks at the time of the inunda-
tion. If the flood is weak, the tzw in the first hy-
pothesis (lower sandbanks) do not remain long
covered by water, and in the second (upper sand-
banks) they are not covered at all. Although pre-
ferring the "upper" hypothesis, Vandier translates
tzw as year(s) 0/ low Nile, and thus of famine by
metonymy. However, the texts in which tzw ap-
pears seem to describe quite dire conditions of
famine, so that I find the first of V andier's hypothe-
ses, the lower sandbanks, the one more probably
correct. Also for this reason, I do not accept Van-
dier's suggestion that tzw was already at this time
a stale over-used image meaning simply famine
from whatever cause, but consider it highly proba-
ble that tzw was an image meaning poor Nile by
metonymy, and famine by consequence.
Moreover it is not clear, either from the exam-
ples we shall encounter belovv or from those cited
by Vandier without a context of famine, that the
tzw have to do with any sort of cultivated land.
They may be simply sandbars in the river, which
are exposed in the season of low water, and remain
exposed, more or less, according to the degree of
deficiency in the flood. This interpretation would
still leave tzw as an appropriate figure of speech
to mean famine due to insufficient flood, but not
for famine from other causes. This view is sup-
ported also by the phrase from the Book of the
Dead from whose prototype Vandier (1950) be-
lieves that Ankhtifi's scribe derived the terms of
the tomb inscription: 0 master of the stormclouds
(igp) ... 0 thou who sailest the bark (0/ Re) by
this sandbar (tzw) of Apophis . ... Thus the ap-
pearance of tzw in a context of famine may, and
indeed should be taken as evidence of a very low
flood, quite sufficient in itself to cause severe famine
without any political complications.
Returning now to the inscription of Ankhtifi,
we find a very severe famine indeed: . . . All of
Upper Egypt was dying of hunger (/:zkr), to such a
degree that everyone had come to eating his chil-
dren, but I managed that no one died of hunger
in this nome. I made a loan of grain to Upper
Egypt . ... I kept alive the house of Elephantine
during these years, after the towns of He/at and
Hormer had been satisfied. ... The entire country
had become like a starved (?) grasshopper, with
people goin g to the north an d to the south (in
search of grain), but I never permitted it to happen
that anyone had to embark from this to another
nome . ...
Vandier (1936 :8) points out that this is one of
only two known references to cannibalism in An-
cient Egypt, an act of desperation that also oc-
curred during famines in mediaeval Arab Egypt
(see Toussoun 1925 :458-474, for details). Vandier,
and Gardiner too (1961:1 I I), are inclined to doubt
that we should take this part literally, in spite of
the numerous other contemporary references to a
lack of grain. I suggest that while the "everyone"
is surely an exaggeration, instances of cannibalism
did occur, else why should it even occur to Ankhti-
fi's scribe to record such an atrocity? The rarity of
the practice, and the probability that it occurred at
all, only serve to make more vivid the desperation
of the people in these years of low Niles (tzw).
It is noteworthy that virtually none of the famine
inscriptions from the Dark Age mention the name
of any king, a drastic change from the style of Old
Kingdom inscriptions. Ankhtifi, indeed, does make
passing Â·mention of a king in the isolated inscrip-
tion: Horus brings/brought (or, May Horus bring)
a (good) inundation for his son Ka-nefer-Re. The
identity of this king (Nefer-ka-Re?) is quite uncer-
tain and useless for dating the tomb more precisely.
But I suggest that Ankhtifi probably had no faith
in any king for whom Horus sent no good inunda-
tion; but when a good flood did finally come he may
have thought it prudent preparation for the afterlife
to offer a phrase of recognition. Or, if we translate
the verb in the past tense, the king could be N efer-
kare Pepi II of Dynasty VI, who ruled in Ankhtifi's
youth, before the bad times, and the phrase intended
as a criticism of present kings. Or it may be simply
a magic wish.
F or vividness of phrasing and interest in natural
conditions (sandstorms), no one equals the author
of the tomb inscriptions of Ankhtifi. Another fam-
ine text, however, that Vandier ( 1950) considers
to be contemporary with it or only slightly later is
the stele of IT! (Cairo 20.001) of Gebelein: ... I
made Gebelein live during the years of misery
(ksnt), at a time when 400 men found themselves
in . . (?) .. I gave wheat from Upper Egypt to
luni and to He/at (Ankhtifi's town) after Gebelein
had been sustained; at a time when Thebes de-
scended and ascended the stream to search for grain
... I never let men of Gebelein go up and down
10 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
the stream to another nome to look for grain ...
(Vandier 1936).
Also probably from this period is the stele of
MERER (Cerny 1961) in the Cracow Museum and
of unknown provenance. Merer calls himself . . .
overseer of the slaughterers of the House of Khuu
(probably nomarchs of Edfu, according to Fischer
1962, Kush 10:333) and recounts how he took care
of his family during the famine, and offered for
thirteen rulers: ... I was a pure one to slaughter
and to offer in two temples on behalf of the ruler;
I offered for thirteen rulers . .. I acquired (proper-
ty) ... I fed my brothers and sisters, I buried him
who was dead and fed him who was alive wher-
ever I alighted in this famine (on this sandbar,
tzw) which occurred. I shut off all their fields and
their mounds in town and in the country, I did not
allow their water to inundate for someone else . ..
I caused Upper Egyptian barley to be given to the
town and I transported for it a great number of
times. ... Here we have one of the clearer linkings
of tzw, a shortage of irrigation water, and famine.
The stelae of Iti and of Merer contain clues that
may explain much of the fighting which occurred
early in this Dark Age, in the references to Thebes
searching upstream and downstream for grain, and
to Merer's efforts to increase his family's supply of
the meager floods at the expense of others. Raids
on the granaries of neighboring districts probably
occurred, as well as violent disputes over water
rights.
Another interesting text comes from Middle
Egypt, where the nomarch of Assiut, I(HETY, re-
fers to building new irrigation works and to pro-
viding for his people in a time of famine (tzw)
in his tomb inscriptions. His date has not been
fixed with certainty, but he evidently grew up at
the royal court in a time of relative calm, if we may
judge from the inscription stating that he learned
swimming with the royal children. There is no
mention of war with Thebes, and Breasted (19Â°6:
405) accordingly suggests that he lived before the
nomarch Tefibi and the latter's son Khety, each of
whom mention war with the south in which they
played an active role on behalf of the Herakleopoli-
tan king of Lower Egypt. Vandier (1936) and
Hayes (1961) also agree in placing this Khety
before Tefibi. Thus we may tentatively consider
that he grew up in the late years of Pepi II, spent
his adult life in the Dark Age, and was able to
maintain a degree of order in his nome and pre-
serve his people from the worst suffering of the
famine. The relevant passages, as kindly translated
for me by N. B. Millet, read:
... I made a monument (probably, a canal) in
-- a substitute for the river, of 10 cubits,. I ex-
cavated for it upon the ploughlands; I provided a
gate . .. in brick . .. in one (act of) building, with-
out dispossessing anyone of any house/property. ...
I nourished my town, I acted as (my own) ac-
countant in regard to food (? ) and as giver of water
in the middle of the day, in order to be very wary
of ??? .. in the island(?) I made a dam for this
town, when Upper Egypt was a desert (?), when
no water could be seen. I closed my (?) frontiers
... (to outsiders) ... I made (agricultural) high-
lands out of swamp and caused the inundation to
flood over old ruined sites. I made ploughlands
out of - - ? - - all people who were in thirst drank.
... I was rich in grain when the land was as a
sandbank (tzw), and nourished my town by meas-
. .
urtng gratn . ...
We have in this inscription two of the clearer
references to a low Nile: ... when no water could
be seen . . . suggesting that the White Nile too
was very low at times; and ... when the land was
as a sandbank (tzw) ... which suggests that Khety
was a contemporary of those others above who
lived in the time of the tzw. Khety's dam was most
probably a barrier on the alluvial flats designed to
retain on his fields as much water as possible in the
event of a too-brief flood, a not uncommon cause
of scarcity or semi-famine in the Islamic era (see
Toussoun 1925:4SSff; and above, under Ankhtifi).
The word tzw appears in four additional texts
collected by Vandier (1936), three of which are
graffiti from Hat-Nub, a quarry in the Hare Nome
in Middle Egypt. (The fourth is Turin 1310, dis-
cussed in the following section.) Graffito 20,
from the 6th year of the nomarch NEHERI, reads
in its relevant part: (I was a man) who ... kept
alive (nourished) his town during the years of low
Niles (tzw), who supplied it when there was noth-
ing, who gave aid to it without making any distinc-
tion between the great and the small. ... Graffiti
23 and 24, by two different sons of Neheri, and
within a year or two of 20 in date, state in almost
identical words: ... I nourished my town, so that
it was supplied wholly during the low Niles (tzw)
of the country, when there was nothing. ...
References to warfare form another major topic
of these same graffiti from Hat-Nub. Egyptologists

and W); in the absence of any initial, the com-
ments are my own.
But first, to stimulate imaginations that have
never witnessed severe famine, we requote from
Carpenter (1966 :69) part of a description of an
actual famine that occurred not so long ago in
northeast Brazil: "In 1953, following three preced-
ing years of unremitting drought, the people of
the burnt-out countryside descended en masse,
armed with every available weapon, to sack and
pillage the settlements where any food had been
stored. Always ... there comes a time, a homicidal
moment, when the famished cannot longer endure
the sight of the well-nourished. Kinsman and
friend alike must succumb to their desperation."
We turn now to Ipuwer and his lament over the
state of Egypt in this Dark Age: ... The inhabi-
tants of the Delta carry shields . .. the tribes of the
desert have become Egyptians everywhere. ... In-
deed, the plunderer is everywhere and the servant
takes what he finds . ...
Indeed, the Nile overflows, yet none plough for
it. Everyone says: uWe do not know what will hap-
pen throughout the land." (E: No one has enough
confidence in these times of uncertainty to till the
fields.) Perhaps this was the year that Ankhtifi
took over Edfu, and found certain areas flooded
due to the incompetence of his predecessor. Even
in a period of prolonged drought a more or less
adequate flood will surely occur from time to time,
as an occasional deficient flood will occur in a pe-
riod of generally liberal ones. A general comment
by Frankfort (1951 :105) may be illuminating here:
"Agriculturalists are inevitably the prey of occa-
sional calamities because they are dependent on
weather and water. But if disasters follow one an-
other frequently without relief ... there is no in-
ducement for the peasant to continue his labours
at all."
Indeed, women are barren and none conceive. 6
Khnum fashions (men) no more because of the
condition of the land . .. hearts are violent, plague
is throughout the land, blood is everywhere ...
many dead are buried in the river; the stream is a
sepulchre and the place of embalmment has become
a stream (E: the corpses are too numerous to be

cattle) .... Squalor is throughout the land, and

Indeed, the land turns round as does a potter's

ing the second sentence, the first would seem to
refer to the social order; but I wonder whether it
might not refer also to the land itself, keeping in
mind Ankhtifi's sandstorms, and Butzer's invading
dunes, and possible shiftings in the course of the
Nile.)
Indeed, the river is blood, yet men drink of it.
Men shrink from human beings and thirst after

is deposed and the dead one is disinterred). (The
ingenuity expended by the kings of Dynasty XII
to build robber-proof burial chambers lends further
support to the idea that the royal tombs of the
Old Kingdom were vandalized during this Dark
Age [Edwards 1961]) .... The land has been de-
prived of the kingship by a few lawless men . ...
The Residence is afraid because of want, and (men
go about?) unopposed to stir up strife. The
possessor of wealth now spends the night thirsty
... he who had no shade is now the possessor of
shade, while the erstwhile possessors of shade are
now in the full blast (?) of the storm . ... The
statues are burnt and their tombs destroyed (a fur-
ther reference to vandalism in the cemeteries).
... Authority, Knowledge, and Truth are with
you (the King), yet confusion is what you set
throughout the land, also the noise of tumult . ...
You have acted so as to bring those things to pass.
... You have told lies (E: lies are told thee), and
the land is brushwood (E: kaka, elsewhere a plant
that easily catches fire). (Thus the vegetation is so
dry it easily catches fire.) All these years are strife,
and a man is murdered on his house-top even
though he was vigilant in his gate-house. ... The
King is here blamed for the condition of the coun-
try, presumably before he was deposed, but in such
general terms that his sins of omission or commis-
sion remain altogether obscure. However, see be-
low, Discussion.
. .. The troops whom we marshalled for our-
selves have turned into foreigners and have taken
to ravaging. (The native recruits, or the merce-
naries [Decline of the Neolithic Wet Phase, above]
are quite out of control.) ... What has come to pass
through it is informing the Asiatics of the state of
the land (that they can invade it with impunity).
(This suggests that the collapse or revolt of the
Egyptian army preceded any invasion or infiltra-
tion by Asiatics that added to the woes of the
Egyptians.)
The basic cause of all the troubles lamented by
Ipuwer is singularly obscure if we consider this
text alone. There are several references to famine,
to the land becoming as desert, and one to plague,
but we look in vain for a direct lament about the
level of the floods or even a reference to tzw. In
the light of other inscriptions, indeed, we wonder
if the Egyptians had some religious taboo, or at
least a superstitious disinclination, about speaking
critically of the Nile. Or one might agree with Van-
dier (1936) that civil disorder was the primary
cause of the famine, but then one is left with no
adequate explanation for the civil disorder. Ipuwer's
reproaches to the King are in the most general
terms; he gives no clue to the grievances which
may have transformed the normally peaceful and
docile Egyptian peasants into a violently rebellious
rabble. Nor does he reproach any nomarch in par-
14 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
ticular (or nomarchs in general) with carrying on
civil war, for destroying the state with his selfish
ambitions. The traditionally unwarlike, unmilitary
character of the Egyptian peasant (Kees 1961 :141)
provides an additional plausibility-argument that
famine was originally the cause of civil disorder
rather than the result of it, although then civil dis-
order may well have delayed recovery from the fam-
ine. Spontaneous combustion into civil war of such
extreme destructiveness as must be assumed if we
are to account for so major a famine, seems to me
decidedly un-Egyptian, and not to be accepted with-
out more clear and compelling evidence. On the
other hand, some of the other texts, especially those
designating famine as the time of the tzw, seem
to indicate clearly a link between very low floods
(tzw) and severe famine.
Although I have emphasized the word tzw be-
cause of its clear implication of "low Nile" and its
appearance in texts describing the most severe con-
ditions of famine, tzw is not the only word that has
been interpreted to mean famine in ancient Egypt.
Vandier (1936 :59-93) identifies and discusses a
number of other words, some of which are even
more indirect. One of the more interesting (kindly
called to my attention by Dr. Millet) which is
found in famine contexts of this period is snb-ib,
literally the heart is healthy. The use of this eu-
phemism or "antiphrase" translated by Vandier
(1936 :90) as years of courage-and which could
well be imagined, although we have no evidence,
as a condensed reference to some currently popular
phrase such as "The heart is healthy, though the
body is weak"-may be taken as further evidence
of the reluctance of the ancient Egyptians to speak
plainly of a failure of the Nile floods.
It is noteworthy that not only do our texts fail
to speak directly of the Nile, but also they never
indicate that any deity is in any way concerned
with the disaster. In Egyptian disaster-literature,
the gods are neither held responsible for the dis-
aster nor prayed to for relief. Their absence may
easily pass unnoticed by the modern western mind.
Yet it is quite otherwise in Mesopotamian disaster-
literature, where the disaster may be explicitly de-
scribed as an affliction sent by a god, particularly
by the chief god, Enlil-for no evident reason as in
the Lament over the Destruction of Dr, or to
reduce the human population which had become
so numerous and noisy that they interfered with the
sleep of the gods as in Atrahasis (ANET, pp. 455-
463 and 104, respectively).
There are a few additional texts which may
throw an indirect light on the condition of the
Nile and on related social conditions. One of these
is a Hymn to the Nile (Wilson 1955 :372) which
was originally composed, most probably, in the
Middle Kingdom. Although not strictly an histori-
cal document, it is worth quoting for an impression
of the conditions which the Egyptians, not long
after the Dark Age, associated with a low Nile:
... If he is sluggish, the nostrils are stopped up
(because it is so dry and dusty?), and everybody
is poor. If there be (thus) a cutting down in the
food-offerings of the gods, then a million men
perish among mortals, covetousness is practiced, the
entire land is in a fury, and great and small are
on the execution-block. ... (But) when he rises,
then the land is in jubilation . ...
... If thou are (too) heavy (to rise), the people
are few, and one begs for the water of the year.
(Then) the rich man looks like him who is worried,
and every man is seen (to be) carrying his weapons.
There is no companion backing up a companion.
There are no garments for clothing; there are no
ornaments for the children of nobles. ... He (the
Nile) who establishes truth in the heart of men,
for it is said: "Deceit comes after poverty" (W:
poverty from a low Nile brings lawlessness) ....
Some of the consequences of a low Nile cited
here seem reminiscent of Ipuwer's laments and
quite excessive for one year under a strong govern-
ment, and it is natural to infer that the Hymn
reflects memories of the many years of very low
Niles of the First Intermediate Period.
Texts from the years c. 215Â°-2000 B.C. By 2130
or a little earlier there were signs of improvement
in natural conditions and in political stability. In
the north, Dynasty X came to power, with a King
Neferkare and his two strong and long-lived suc-
cessors, Wahkare Khety and Merikare ruling from
Herakleopolis over Lower Egypt. In the south, the
nomarch of Thebes, Inyotef, established a rival
dynasty (XI), declaring himself King of Upper
Egypt, c. 2133, as the Horus Sehertowy; he was
followed by Inyotef II, Horus Wahankh, who
reigned for some SO years (c. 2117-2069), and by
Inyotef III, Horus Nakhtnebtepnefer for 8 years
( c. 2068-2061) according to the chronology of
Hayes (1961).
Although political stability had clearly improved,
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 15
Vandier (1936 :12) points out nine funerary stelae
which he dates to the period of the Inyotef (Antef)
kings and which contain an assertion that the
owner saved his district or town by distribution of
grain in a time of famine (most commonly, bur-
densome years, or years of misery, ksnt). Hayes
(1961) also discusses a number of these Upper
Egyptian stelae.
The word tzw appears in only one (Turin 1310)
of these inscriptions, in an enigmatic passage which
reads (Vandier 1936): He (the king?) repelled
(?) the years of famine (tzw) from the land. He,
Vandier suggests, is most probably the founder of
the dynasty, Inyotef I. In the light of my general
thesis, this may be interpreted to mean that the
years of very low Niles (tzw) and of severe famines
came to an end under his rule, as it is reasonable
to believe on other grounds, and King Inyotef, as
a true Horus King, is claiming credit for the im-
provement (see Discussion, below).
This group of inscriptions seem to describe con-
ditions less severe than the time of the tzw, and
apparently we should imagine that climate condi-
tions improved in a fluctuating manner, with years
of good inundation becoming more frequent and
deficient years less frequent and less severely de-
ficient. For completeness I include the most rele-
vant passages, translated from Vandier (1936),
although because of uncertainties in dating they
contribute no great amount of additional informa ..
tion. The first seven (following Vandier's number-
ing) come from the time of Inyotef I, or slightly
earlier, that is, to the later years of the first great
drought.
I) Stele of Djari, of Qurneh: ... I was a great
provider for their houses, in the year of famine
(rnpt snb-ib), I gave to those whom I did not know
as well as to those whom I did know . ...
2) The stele of Iti of Gebelein, already quoted
above, is considered by Hayes to be somewhat later
than the inscriptions of Ankhtifi, but not neces-
sarily as late as Inyotef I.
3) Stele of Heka ..ib (BM 1671), also of Gebelein,
and according to Vandier (1936, 1950), contem ..
porary with Iti: . . . I have provided this entire
town with Upper Egyptian grain for several years,
without counting (?) .... I gave oil to Hierakon-
polis after my town had been provided for. ...
4) Stele of Djehouti of Qurneh: ... I supplied
the temple of Amun during the years of misery
(k snt). ...
5) Turin 13 10 : He (the king?) repelled the
years of low Niles (tzw) from the land.
6) Stele of Antefoker (BM 1628): . . . I pos-
sessed barley and wheat; I gave barley and wheat
to the hungry, and I supported everyone in my
vicinity during the famine (/:zkrw), acting in such
a way that no one died. ...
7) Stele of Senni (Cairo 20500): ... I measured
out life-giving grain of Upper Egypt for this entire
town in the palace of the count ... during the
miserable years of famine (ksnt nt snb-ib).
The last two of the nine stelae are several decades
later; one of them is clearly dated by the name of
King Inyotef III. This one (8), the stele of Ideni
of Abydos (Cairo 20502), reads in part: ... I was a
man who gathered his energy in the day of misery
(hrw n ksnt) ... a man of whom the Horus
Nakhtnebtepnefer, King of Upper and Lower
Egypt, son of Re, Inyotef (III), living forever,
(said?) on the subject of the plan to keep alive
( nourish) this town: IIHe has done all that I or-
dered throughout the entire country."
And finally (9) the stele of . . (? ) . . . (Cairo
20503): ... I kept alive (nourished) my town, in
the year of misery (ksnt), so that my name would
be good. ...
These two stelae indicate a year of scarcity, al-
though not necessarily of severe famine, during the
reign of Inyotef III.
Turning now to Lower Egypt, we find that this
period remains a Dark Age in terms of available
information, in spite of the improvement in politi-
cal stability. But around 2080 the father of King
Merikare, probably Wahkare Khety, is able to
say in his Instructions to his son (Wilson 1955):
... There is no enemy within the compass of thy
frontier. ... I pacified the entire west, as far as the
coast of the sea. . . . But the east is rich in bow-
men ... turned about are the islands in the midst
(later, under Dynasties XVIII-XX, this would
mean the islands of the Aegean but whether the
phrase had this meaning already c. 2100 is uncer-
tain) .... Lo, the wretched Asiatic . .. he has been
fighting since the time of Horus, he does not con-
quer nor yet can he be conquered. He does not
announce a day in fighting, like a thief. ... I made
the Northland smite them, I captured their inhab-
itants, and I took their cattle, to the disgust of the
Asiatics against Egypt. Do not trouble thyself about
him: he is only an Asiatic. ... He may rob a
16 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
single person, but he does not lead against a town
of many citizens. ... Somewhat puzzling is his
description of the land of the Asiatics as both
afflicted with water, difficult from many trees,
unless "water" here means "rain," which the Egyp-
tians may have considered an inferior and unrelia-
ble source of water.
Merikare is advised to deal firmly with agitators:
A talker is an exciter of a city ... , and traitors, to
liquidate them before they can stir up trouble
(Wilson 1955; Erman 1927); to be skillful in
speech; and to rule benevolently and justly, ...
but keep thine eyes open, one that is trusting will
become one that is afflicted. ...
More directly relevant to our main theme: Thou
suDerest not from the Nile, that it cometh not, and
thou hast the products (taxes) of the Delta . . .
(Erman 1927). This I take as evidence that some
of his predecessors, within vivid memory, had suf-
fered from the Nile, that its flood had failed to
come.
Another interesting verse seems to refer to the
large number of young people among the popu-
lation: Behold thy commonalty is full of those
newly grown up, of such as are 20 years old. The
young generation is happy in following its heart.
. . . Increase the younger generation of thy fol-
lowers, that it may be provided with property, en-
dowed with fields and rewarded with cattle . . .
(Erman 1927). While the meaning of this passage
is uncertain, it suggests to me that there has been
no serious famine for at least twenty years, and
that since the end of the famine there has been a
great increase in the population.
We should not expect, however, that a return
to normal floods would be followed promptly by
a full political and cultural revival and the build-
ing of fine large monuments. Both the king and
his subjects would be too busy reorganizing the
kingdom, and repairing and restoring the irriga-
tion system of canals and dikes. Even if the king
desired to build a large monument, after a severe
and prolonged famine the population would be so
much reduced that he would be prevented by a
shortage of skilled labor. As for reunification of
the Two Lands, of Upper and Lower Egypt, this
would have to await the appearance on the throne
of a local king who possessed the necessary dynamic
qualities.
Merikare was further advised to deal tactfully
with the South and not to provoke it. Apparently
he disregarded this advice, went to war and re-
covered the nome of Abydos, with substantial help
from another Khety of Assiut. His triumph was
shortlived, however, for by 2Â°40 his kingdom had
been overthrown, and Upper and Lower Egypt
forcibly reunited by King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep
of Thebes, who is traditionally regarded as the
founder of the Middle Kingdom.
The floods were evidently adequate, or better,
during the so-year reign (2060-2010) of King Men-
tuhotep II. The large and original funerary monu-
ment built by this king at Deir el Bahri near
Thebes gives evidence of a high level of prosperity.
And Vandier (1936) finds only one possible refer-
ence to famine, in the stele of a certain Mentuhotep,
son of Hepi: When a little inundation (bcpy) hap-
pened, in the year 25 (probably of Mentuhotep II,
although Griffith favors Senwosret I of Dynasty
XII, and Goedicke [lEA 1962] favors Inyotef II),
I did not allow my nome to suffer hunger; I gave
it wheat and barley and I did not allow a famine
to occur in it before the years of big inundations
returned. Whatever its date, this does not suggest
anything as serious as those we have considered
above, but only a poor year in the midst of a series
of good floods. It is also more forthright in speak-
ing openly of a little inundation .
Texts from the years c. 2002-C. 1950 B.C. With
the death of King Seankhkare Mentuhotep III
about 1998, Dynasty XI came to an end in a second
period of disorder, brought on, I suggest, by an-
other period of low Niles, drought and sandstorms,
a second "exclamation point" emphasizing the end
of the Neolithic Wet Phase. It is generally con-
sidered that the twelve-year reign of Mentuhotep
III was peaceful and prosperous, but there is one
document that, in retrospect, may be considered an
omen of trouble to come. This is a letter written
to his family by a certain Hekanakht when he was
on a business journey during a famine caused by
a low Nile. This document, recently translated by
James (1962) and by Baer (1963), states that . . .
the whole land is perished, but you have not been
hungry. ... When I came hither southwards I
fixed your rations properly. (Now) is the inunda..
tion very high? Now our food is fixed for us in
proportion to the inundation. So be patient, all of
you who are listed here I have managed to
keep you alive until today Take heed lest you
be angry . .. everything is mine. It must be said,
((Being half alive is better than dying altogether."
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 17
Now one should say hunger only in regard to real
hunger. They have begun to eat people here. ...
This last, Vandier ( 1936) and others consider
to be an exaggeration intended to impress those to
whom Hekanakht is writing; in absence of other
evidence for very bad times, and considering the
general tone of Hekanakht's letters, I must agree.
But I would also suggest that the statement de-
rives from a memory of the earlier time of more
terrible famine, when Ankhtifi speaks of canni-
balism.
These terrible times were soon to come again,
although more briefly. Following the death of
Mentuhotep III come five to seven years of dark-
ness, about which very little is known. A King
Nebtowyre Mentuhotep IV apparently occupied
the throne for at least two years of this period, but
he is known only from the inscriptions in Wadi
Hammamat by his Vizier Amenemhet, and seems
subsequently not to have been considered a legiti-
mate ruler. Following Seankhkare, the Turin
Papyrus mentions seven kingless years. During the
period a fresh outbreak of raids by the Libyans of
the western desert and by the Asiatics from the
northeast apparently occurred.
The primary document on the confused and
obscure period between the end of Dynasty XI
and the start of Dynasty XII is the so-called Proph-
ecy of NEFERTY, composed during the reign of
Amenemhet I. In the words of Posener (CAH
fasc. 29, p. 8) this document "combines in one
sinister picture these recent memories with older
memories of the depredations of the Asiatics dur-
ing the First Intermediate Period." And not only of
the Asiatics, but also of the chaotic social and
natural conditions in both periods, for N eferty has
a good deal to say about the natural conditions of
the land, and gives a rather clearer picture than
did Ipuwer. The quotes are mainly from Erman
(1927), with occasional phrases from Wilson
(1955). The invading sand dunes should be kept
in mind while reading the words of Neferty.
. . . That which was made is as if it were never
made, and Re must begin to found anew (E: begin
creation over again). The whole land has perished,
there is none left, not the black of the nail survives
of what should be there (W: Not so much of the
Black Land of Egypt survives as might be under
7 In the modern fluctuation to greater aridity that set in
around 1900, the flow diminished from both the Blue and the
a fingernail). Probably it was buried under blow-
ing sand and invading dunes.
This land is ruined; no one concerns himself
about it any more, no one speaks, and no eye weeps
(E: That is no longer worthwhile) .... The sun is
veiled and will not shine that men may see. None
can live when the storm veils it (the sun), all men
are dulled (?) through want of it. (E: By this
obscuring of the sun, of which he also speaks be-
low, not a single eclipse is intended, but dust- and
sand-storms, suiting, as they do, the following de-
scriptions of the drought.) (Cf. also the dust storms
of Ankhtifi, above.)
The river of Egypt is empty, men cross over the
water on foot. (This implies a failure of the White
Nile, thus of the rains over east-central Africa.) 7
Men search for water upon which the ships may
sail; its road is become a bank, and the bank is
become water. Probably this refers to shiftings in
the location of the river bed, accompanying the
erratic and abnormal fluctuations in the volume
of water, and the drifting sands; it is well estab-
lished (Butzer 1959a, 1960) that shiftings did occur
from time to time.
The south wind drives away the north wind
(E: which brings coolness and humidity), and the
sky has still only the one wind (meaning, the
north wind failed to come at its normal season?).
The birds no longer hatch their eggs in the swamps
of the Delta, but the bird hath made her a nest nigh
unto men (E: The birds migrate from the dried-up
swamps to inhabited regions, where water still
exists) ....
Foes are in the East, Asiatics are come down into
Egypt By night one will suddenly be fallen
upon (?) .
Â· .. This land is taken away and added to (W:
is brought-and-taken) (by the varying course of the
river and the drifting dunes?), and no one knows
what the issue will be. ...
Â· .. Men take up weapons of war, the land lives
in confusion (E: In the prevailing distress all live
on robbery) .... They beg for bread with blood.
Men laugh with a laughter of disease . .. and one
slayeth another. ... Men take the goods of a man
of high estate from him and give them to one from
without. ... The possessor is in deprivation and
him from without is contented.
Â· .. The land is diminished and its governors are

18 BARBARA BELL lAJA 75
many. The field is bare, and its taxes are great;
little is the grain and great the grain measure (of
taxes), and it is measured to overflowing.
The sun separates himself from men (E: by
sandstorms); he arises when it is the hour. No one
knows when it is midday, for his shadow cannot
be distinguished (E: on the sundial) .... He is
in the sky like the moon, and yet he does not deviate
from his accustomed time. ...
But finally, a king shall come from the south,
called Ameni, and he put the country to rights
again, particularly by driving out the Asiatics, and
building the "Wall of the Prince" to keep them
out. Fortunately, Nature cooperated and the Nile
floods returned more or less to normal, and King
Amenemhet I was able to launch his country into
one of the most glorious periods of its long history,
known as the Middle Kingdom.
Since virtually nothing is known of this brief
Dark Age at the end of Dynasty XI, we may
speculate briefly in the light of the climatological
hypothesis. It is generally agreed that the future
King Amenemhet I was the same man as the
Vizier Amenemhet who led an expedition to the
Wadi Hammamat in year two of King Mentu-
hotep IV. Hayes (1961) has noted that the tone of
the inscriptions of Amenemhet suggest a loyal
servant of his king, not a man plotting imminent
revolt. I suggest that Amenemhet may have been
driven to reconsider whether this Mentuhotep was
in truth a proper and legitimate king, approved
by the gods, when the floods failed so severely. Or
perhaps Mentuhotep himself developed such doubts
of his own legitimacy that he abdicated or died
( see Discussion, below), since his claim to the
throne is anyway obscure.
Further support to the idea of a serious failure
of the Nile preceding the reign of Amenemhet I
is provided by the quotation from his Instructions
to his son: ... I was the one who made barley, the
beloved of the grain-god. The Nile honored me
on every broad expanse (the inundations were
good). No one hungered in my years; no one
thirsted therein . ... Everything which I had com-
manded was in the proper place (Wilson 1955).
Regarding the relations between the king and
the feudal nomarchs in the early years of Amenem-
het I, Hayes (1961 :35) states that the new king saw
to it that "the boundaries of the nomes were rigor-
ously established and regulations were enacted
covering each district's share in the supply of Nile
water available for purposes of irrigation" (see also
Gardiner 1961 :128; and Breasted 1906 :628). This
again suggests not only that water was not abun-
dant at the very start of his reign, but also that
much of the fighting in the times of great trouble
may have been over access to the severely limited
water supply. We have already seen that Merer
shut off certain fields and did not allow his family's
water to irrigate for someone else, and that Khety
of Assiut built new irrigation works the better to
utilize the meager water available. And we may
speculate whether Ankhtifi's ability to supply other
towns in the time of worst famine, in spite of
living ina relatively poor part of the country, may
have been related not only to the organizing effi-
ciency and resourcefulness of which he boasts, but
to the fact that his nomes had first access to the
water. In normal times of course this would not
matter, but if the river fell so low that one could
walk across it, there could be some advantage in
first access.
In this context we may note two items from the
"Protestations of Guiltlessness" (Wilson 1955 :34)
by the soul appearing before a posthumous court:
A31: I have not held up the water in its season
(W: denied the inundation waters to others); and
A32: I have not built a dam against running water.
No doubt there were many who did, including
Merer, and Khety of Assiut, as noted above.
With the reign of Amenemhet I, we come to the
end of the First Dark Age in Egypt-an age
bracketed by two particularly troubled and dark
intervals, each associated with a severe drought,
about 2180 to 2130, and 2000 to 1990 B.C. Dynasty
XII, c. 1991-1786 B.C. was a period of strong gov-
ernment, cultural advance and general prosperity.
There was no significant revival of the rains over
the desert (Butzer 1958), no return of the Neolithic
Wet Phase, but the inundations were evidently
adequate. I shall discuss elsewhere what can be
known of their levels. Vandier (1936) was able to
find only one text referring to famine in these
years, an inscription in the tomb of Ameny,
Nomarch of Beni Hasan, during the reign of Sen-
wosret I. The Nomarch Ameny sta~es (Breasted
19 06 :52 3): ... When years of famine came, I
plowed all the fields of the Oryx Nome, as far as
its southern and northern boundaries, preserving its
people alive, and furnishing its food so that there
was none hungry therein . ... Then came great
Niles, producers of grain and of all things, (but)
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 19
I did not collect the arrears of the field (taxes) ....
This inscription no doubt gives a picture of the
normal situation in years of low Nile, which must
have occurred from time to time throughout Egyp-
tian history, though rarely with such severity as in
the Dark Ages at the end of Dynasty VI and
between Dynasties XI and XII. Vandier notes
that Griffith considers that the inscription of Men-
tuhotep, son of Hepi, refers to the same famine
as Ameny's inscription.
DISCUSSION
Most Egyptologists who attempt to explain the
collapse of the Old Kingdom stress the declining
power and wealth of the king and the growing
power and independence of the provincial nobility.
Evidence of this trend through Dynasty VI is too
plentiful to be questioned and need be mentioned
here only briefly: from as early as the end of
Dynasty IV, the royal pyramids decrease in size
while the mastabas of the great nobles gro\v in
size and splendor; in Dynasty VI many a noble
abandoned the earlier custom of a tomb near the
royal pyramid in favor of a tomb in his own prov-
ince; governorships became hereditary, with "only
a perfunctory nod in the direction of Memphis"
(Hayes 1953). This much is beyond dispute. What
is questionable is whether such a trend is sufficient
explanation for a disaster of the magnitude that
overwhelmed Egypt at the end of Dynasty VI.
I have suggested rather that dire famine, due to
prolonged (on the historic, though very brief on
the geologic, time scale) failure of the rains over
the central and eastern African sources of the Nile
-a sort of "exclamation point" emphasizing the
ending of the Neolithic Wet Phase-was the crisis
that shattered a weakened central government
utterly unable to cope with the problem, and deci-
mated the Egyptian people. We have considered a
number of ancient texts that support this point of
view, and the meaning of which becomes clearer
when read in this light. Moreover, the literature
"voicing the bewilderment and despair with which
Egyptians faced the overturn of their once stable
world" (Wilson 1956) is more readily understood
if we conceive of a cause that they were essentially
helpless to remedy.
Let us explore some further political aspects of
this hypothesis. Of the time of Dynasty VI, the
decades before the disaster, Hayes (1953:131)
writes: " ... One cannot help but feel that it was
only through personal loyalty that the great rulers
of Upper Egypt [served] the crown. Once the
king, incapable of controlling his provincial gov-
ernors by force, found himself unable to win their
loyalty through favors and wisely chosen conces-
sions, the whole fabric of the pharaonic govern-
ment fell to pieces."
We consider this situation against the back-
ground of the Egyptian concept of Kingship, par-
ticularly as described by Frankfort, Wilson and
Aldred. In the words of Frankfort (1951 :120) :
"The Egyptian system ... [in which] ... a god
had consented to guide the nation ... gave a sense
of security which the Asiatic contemporaries of the
ancient Egyptians totally lacked ... a pledge that
the forces of nature would be well disposed and
bring prosperity and peace." "That Pharaoh was
of divine essence, a god incarnate" is fundamental
to the Egyptian concept of Kingship, "and this
view can be traced back as far as texts and symbols
take us" (Frankfort 1948:5); the attitude can be
seen most readily in art-in war scenes, hunting
scenes, and scenes involving the other gods-from
the time of N armer.
Introducing a text from Dynasty XII, Wilson
(1955:431) writes: "The king of Egypt ruled the
land as a god, as the Son of Re, or as the Horus,
or as the incorporation of the deities of Upper
and Lower Egypt. He was also a synthesis of other
gods who represented forces of proper rule, a blend
of force and intelligence, of terror and nurture, or
of sustenance and punishment. . . . Some of the
divine elements which went into the composition
of a pharaoh" are set forth in a poem of instruc-
tion addressed to his children by Sehetepibre,
Chief Treasurer under King Ni-maat-Re Amenem-
het III: Worship King Ni-maat-Re, living forever,
within your bodies, and associate with his majesty
in your hearts. He is Perception (W: cognitive in-
telligence, an attribute of good rule), which is in
the hearts, and his eyes search out everybody. He is
Re, by whose beams one sees. He illumines the
Two Lands more than the sun. He makes the Two
Lands more verdant than does a high Nile. For
he has filled the Two Lands with strength and life.
... He giveth vital force to them that serve him
Â· . Â· (Wilson 1955; Erman 1927).
Under Dynasty XVIII this attitude was ex-
pressed in an inscription in the tomb of Rekhmire,
vizier under King Thutmose III (Frankfort
194 8 :47): What is the King of Upper and Lower
20 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
Egypt? He is a god by whose dealings one lives,
the father and the mother of all men, alone by him-
self, without an equal. Moreover the King's power
and his concern for his realm do not cease with his
death, for we read in another inscription (Frank-
fort 1948:195): Thutmose III is in heaven like
the moon. The Nile is at his service. He opens its
cave to give life to Egypt.
Aldred (1963, 1965) particularly stresses the rela-
tion between king and Nile, and writes that the
Egyptian concept of the god-king derived from the
"prehistoric rainmaker who kept his tribe, their
crops, and beasts in good health by exercising a
magic control over the weather ... [who was] ...
transformed into the Pharaoh, able to sustain the
entire nation by having command over the Nile
flood. . . . The Kingship and the Nile are inti-
mately associated .... The earliest kings were asso-
ciated with the control of the flood waters . . ."
(Aldred 1963:157). "The never-failing inundations
of the river were more predictable in their occur-
rences, though not in their volume, and therefore
more amenable to control than the weather" (Al-
dred 1965 :50). Indeed, the climatic conditions of
Egypt were almost uniquely suited to inspire the
confidence of the people in any divine power
claimed by their kings, far more so than in western
Asia; and the predictability of the Nile probably
played no insignificant role in the successful de-
velopment of the dogma of divine kingship.
In the earliest Pyramid Texts, inscribed on the
walls of the tomb chamber of the Pyramid of Unis,
the king is poetically identified with the Nile flood
(Cerny 1952:85): It is Unis who inundates the land
and who has come forth from the lake, it is Unis
who plucks the papyrus plant. Pyre 388; and in
Pyr. 5Â°7-8: Unis came today from the fullness of
the flood, he is Subek, with a green feather, watch-
ful face and uplifted fore-part of the body. ... He
came to his pools which are on the shore inundated
by the Great Fullness, to the place of satisfaction,
with green fields (the place) which is in the realm
of light. Pyre 509 (trans!. N. B. Millet) continues:
Unis causes the plants to become green on the two
banks of the realm of light. Cerny points out that
in later Pyramid Texts the god Osiris is connected
with the flooding of the Nile on several occasions,
and from the Middle Kingdom onward is often
referred to as the god of floods and vegetation.
Since the earliest texts, those of King Unis, refer
thus to the king and not to Osiris, Cerny suggests
that Osiris received his flood-vegetation attributes
from his identification with the dead king.
King Amenemhet I of Dynasty XII includes the
occurrence of good floods among the reasons why
he deserves the loyalty and gratitude of all his
subjects: ... I was the one who made barley, the
beloved of the grain-god. The Nile honored me
on every broad expanse. No one hungered in my
years, no one thirsted therein . ... Everything
which I had commanded was in the proper place
(Wilson 1955 :4 19). Frankfort (194 8 :57) empha-
sizes that the king here asserts that he "partakes
of the essence of these natural phenomena .... The
king 'produced barley,' not merely in an indirect
way, for instance by caring for the farmers or fur-
thering agriculture, but through his own actions-
by maintaining Maat, the right order which al-
lowed nature to function unimpaired for the bene-
fit of man. Hence the Nile rose effectively at the
inundation so that the arable land reached its
maximum extent and the people prospered."
Frankfort instructively compares this Dynasty
XII text with a song written for the accession of
King Merneptah of Dynasty XIX, more than 700
years later, as translated by Erman: Rejoice, thou
entire land, the goodly time has come. A lord is
appointed in all countries great of kingship
like Horus . .. Merneptah Truth has repressed
falsehood (W: The Egyptian concept of malat
"truth, order, right" was of the essential order of
the universe, given by the gods at the beginning
and maintained and reconfirmed by the god-king).
The sinners are fallen on their faces . ... The water
standeth and faileth not, the Nile carrieth a high
flood. The days are long, the nights have hours, the
months come aright (W: Order is found also in
the regularity of times and seasons, restored by the
new king). The gods are content and happy of
heart, and life is spent in laughter and wonder.
Frankfort (1948 :58) points out that "The com-
parison of the two texts enhances their significance.
The song might be thought to contain merely the
hyperboles of a festive mood, were it not that they
recur in the grim context of Amenemhet's teach-
ing. There the beneficial influence of the king is
stressed only to bring out his utter loneliness,
for notwithstanding it he was betrayed. And yet,
though the two texts differ in both mood and age,
we find them describing regal power with the same
attributes, as strong a proof as we are likely to
find that the Egyptians really believed these at-
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 21
tributes to pertain to their king. This power, then,
includes the remarkable capacity to dominate and
further natural processes, especially the inundation
of the Nile on which the prosperity of Egypt de-
pends. Because the king, who has established Maat,
who has defeated falsehood, comes to the throne,
there are abundant inundations; and the seasons-
that is, the months and days and nights-follow
each other in orderly procession. So the song. But
the teaching of Amenemhet says practically the
same thing: none was hungry, for the king made
the corn grow; and the Nile, in obedience, rose
to all accessible places so that they could be tilled.
Even as late an author as Ammianus Marcellinus
knew that the Egyptians ascribed plenty or famine
to the quality of their king-not, in a modern sense,
to his quality as an administrator, but to his effec-
tiveness as an organ of integration, partaking of
the divine and of the human and intrusted with
making the mutual dependence of the two a source
of 'laughter and wonder.' "
The concept of the king's influence over nature
also appears behind the words of flattery addressed
by Sinuhe to King Senwosret I : Whether I am in
the Residence or in this place, it is ever thou that
obscurest this horizon, and the sun ariseth at thy
pleasure; the water in the river is drunk when thou
wiliest, and the air in heaven is breathed when
thou biddest (Erman 1927:25). Probably this is
merely an Egyptian way of saying "I recognize
and accept you as the legitimate god-king of Egypt,
as the true Horus."
Let us now link together the factors described
in the preceding pages of this section: the great
nobles of Upper Egypt waxing in independent
power and bound to the throne by increasingly
fragile ties; the fundamental link between the
divinity of the king and his control over the floods;
and to this combination add the prolonged and
severe failure of the floods, to the extent that people
throughout Egypt were dying of starvation-the
tzw-famines of several ancient texts. Imagine an
average king on the throne, a man with no out-
standing qualities of leadership but adequate to
normal conditions. With these ingredients, I sug-
gest, we have a quite sufficient and entirely plausi-
ble explanation for the troubles that afflicted Egypt
in its First Intermediate Period, or First Dark
Age. The central government, unable to deal effec-
tively with so severe a famine and drought, and
undermined at its ideological core by the very exist-
ence of this revolt by nature, simply collapsed. The
local nobility became as free in spirit as in fact to
cope locally with the famine to whatever extent
their various individual abilities permitted, and
also free to ignore the supposed king in their tomb
inscriptions, a practice general in this period and
utterly contrary to earlier usage.
There remains one major characteristic of Egyp-
tian Dark Ages in need of explanation, the short
reigns and the very large number of kings to be
fitted into relatively few years. Here I shall venture
a step beyond what seems to me the realm of sound
probability, into the realm of speculation, to pro-
pose a hypothesis that I believe makes sense of
these numerous short reigns, in the context of a
Dark Age caused primarily by deficient Nile floods
in a land ruled by god-kings.
When we consult the revised CAR (Smith 1962;
Hayes 1961, 1962) we find at least 31 Kings, and
possibly as many as 40, in the interval from the
death of Pepi II to the end of Dynasty IX, a period
now believed to cover no more than about 60 years,
c. 2190 to c. 2130; and this disregards the descrip-
tion by Manetho of Dynasty VII as composed of
70 Kings who reigned for 70 days. From the death
of Pepi II to the end of Dynasty VIII, c. 2160, we
have at least 18 Kings in some 30 years. Dynasty
VI itself ended with several ephemeral reigns fol-
lowing that of Pepi II; the Turin Papyrus appears
originally to have listed eight Kings (Gardiner
1961) but the names of only three have survived,
and only these three are included in the total of
18. For Dynasty IX, c. 2160-2130, the Turin Papyrus
indicates thirteen Kings. With Dynasty X condi-
tions finally became more stable, with five Kings
in some 90 years.
In addition to the evidence from the various
King Lists, it is of interest to recall the statement
of Merer that he offered for thirteen rulers (bk3w),
in a single adult lifetime, during which tzw-
famines occurred. Unfortunately the word bk3w
does not enable us to distinguish between kings
and nomarchs, nor is it certain that thirteen living
rulers are meant (N. B. Millet, private communi-
cation); Cerny (1961) interprets it, with some un-
ease, as thirteen living nomarchs. But thirteen liv-
ing kings seems the most plausible interpretation
within the historical context.
Almost nothing is known of the genealogy of the
Kings of the First Dark Age. The popularity of
22 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
the praenomen "Neferkare" in Dynasty VII..VIII,
and to a lesser extent in Dynasty IX, is often taken
as evidence that the Kings of Dynasties VII-IX re-
garded themselves as legitimate successors of Nefer-
kare Pepi II (Hayes 1961). Since Pepi II had four
known Queens, and an unknown number of sons,
daughters and grandchildren, and moreover is be-
lieved to have lived to be 100, it is quite likely that
he outlived most of his children, and it is easy to
imagine that the order of the succession became
uncertain and controversial at or shortly after his
death, or at the end of Dynasty VI. Then Manetho's
tradition of 70 Kings who ruled for 70 days might
be imagined as a council of royal princes, descend-
ants of N eferkare Pepi II, ruling collectively while
they tried to resolve the question of which of them
should become king.
The next Dynasty, be it properly called VII or
VIII, evidently began with a King Neferkare "the
Younger," a son or grandson of Pepi II by Ankhes-
en-Pepi, the Queen of his late years; Neferkare
the Younger was credited by the Turin Papyrus
(Hayes 1953) with a reign of just over four years,
leaving only fourteen years for his fourteen succes-
sors of Dynasty VII-VIII. It is clear that there can
be no question of a succession of generations among
these Kings, and it has been suggested (Millet,
1968 lecture) that for some reason in this period the
succession passed from brother to brother. While
resulting in shorter reigns, even this hardly seems
adequate to account for fourteen Kings in fourteen
years, nor even some 31+ Kings in no more than
60 years. (A similar difficulty occurs also in the
Second Intermediate Period with Dynasty XIII,
and in the early part of the Dark Age around 1200
BoC.)
The need to explain these very numerous short
reigns invites a radical hypothesis, which however
fits well into our general picture of the situation.
In brief, I suggest that the reigns of many of the
kings in these periods were terminated rather
promptly by death, either by suicide or by secret
murder, when their performance of all the correct
rites failed to produce any significant alleviation of
the drought.
Although there is no evidence from ancient
Egypt, there is evidence from recent times in various
regions of Africa about what happens to a rain-
maker king in a time of unusual drought. From
c. G. Seligman's Egypt and Negro Africa, a Study
in Divine Kingship, p. 38, Frankfort (1948:34)
quotes that the African "king of Juken is ... able
to control the rain and winds. A succession of
droughts or bad harvests is ascribed to his negli-
gence or to the waning of his strength, and he is
accordingly secretly strangled." And there are other
tribes, "like the Shilluk [who] will destroy their
king when he threatens to become an imperfect
link between man and the gods. . . . It has re-
peatedly been maintained that the Egyptians, too,
killed their king and for the same reason; but of
this there is no proof at all. The Egyptians, how-
ever, did regard their king in the same manner-
a bond between nature and man" (Frankfort
194 8:47)Â·
Childe (1953) points out that the Pharaoh is a
type of divine king, described by Frazer, who
"holds his sovereignty by virtue of his magic pow-
er," and as its price must submit to ritual death
before his body, and hence his magic power, grows
feeble with age. In Egypt he was ritually revitalized
by the sed-festival from the time of Menes onward.
Egyptologists agree that the Egyptians did not as a
regular practice kill their king, and that ritual re-
vitalization played at least some role in the sed-
festival. In spite of the magic..symbolic renewal of
the king's power by the sed-festival, however, Al-
dred (1963 :157) considers it significant that ...
"the tradition that the king should die for his peo-
ple persisted in folk-lore and in the more primitive
spells of The Pyramid Texts; and there are an-
thropologists who believe that the ceremonial kill-
ing of the Pharaoh was sometimes revived in mo-
ments of crisis."
If ever there was a crisis calling for such ex-
treme measures, the First Dark Age, the period of
the tzw-famines, was surely such a time. Frankfort
(194 8) emphasizes that there is no proof that any
such thing ever occurred in Egypt. But then, there
is little proof for anything--except famine, civil
disorder, and too many kings-from the Dark
Ages. Moreover, in addition to influencing the
powers of Nature, "the king was the personification
of ma'at, a word which we translate as 'rightness'
or 'truth' or 'justice,' but which also seems to have
the meaning of 'the natural cosmic order.' The
forces of evil could upset ma'at until restoration
had been effected by some appropriate act-a magic
rite, or the advent of a new king" (Aldred 1963 :161).
A prolonged and severe failure of adequate floods,
the tzw-famines, must have represented to the an-
cient Egyptians a uniquely profound upset of the
1971] THE DARK AGES IN ANCIENT HISTORY 23
natural cosmic order which might well seem to de-
mand a drastic remedy, and might well lead them
to try one new king after another, as each con-
spicuously failed to restore ma(at-particularly if
the drought should occur at a time when there was
an unusual degree of uncertainty about the identity
of the prince chosen for the next incarnation of
Horus.
We noted above that Ipuwer seems to blame the
king for the sorry state of the land, but completely
fails to specify what the king was doing wrong.
In the light of the above discussion it appears proba-
ble that Ipuwer actually had no specific idea what
the king was doing wrong. But since maintaining
ma(at, by some supernatural power, was the pri-
mary duty of the king, the occurrence of disorder,
of famine, and of failure of the floods, would mean
that the god-king had somehow failed in his prime
duty.
Without any particular reference to the Dark
Ages, Anthes (1959, /NES 18 :180) considers that
"the Pyramid Texts indicate conclusively that
there existed a supreme court of sorts who nomi-
nated the king. It is hard to imagine that their ac-
tivity would have been restricted to the mere ac-
clamation of the new king." I am not able to offer
an opinion on the validity of this concept. But if it
has any validity, we may imagine the indecision
and confusion in this council as year after year the
floods failed to rise above famine levels-particu-
larly if there was no one prince who by the usual
standards had a claim much superior to those of his
rivals. Such a condition could easily occur after so
long a reign as that of Pepi II, with at least four
queens. One can imagine the council approving
one prince after another, as to each Horus brought
no good inundation, in an increasingly frantic effort
to discover the true Son of Horus, and persuading or
coercing each prince in turn to kill himself after
he had performed the proper rites and received
no recognition from the god. Now and then there
would be a year or two or three of hope, with at
least meagerly adequate flooding, and then again
failure. In all probability the prince himself would
lose confidence in his right to be king, and only the
most irreligious, or cowardly, would resist the pres-
sure to kill himself.
If this picture corresponds in any way to reality
-and the reality of the hypothetical council is not
essential to the correspondence-we should surmise
that the same situation recurred at the end of Dy-
nasty XI, with the seven-year darkness that fol-
lowed the death of Seankhkare Mentuhotep III.
Hayes (1953 :167) mentions three names in addi-
tion to Nebtowyre Mentuhotep IV who may have
reigned briefly in this interval. The practice in
Dynasty XII, whereby each king appointed his
chosen heir co-regent in his lifetime, may have
been motivated in part by a desire to reduce the
influence of the council in the naming of a new
king. The power of the council would wax and
wane, inversely with the prosperity and stability
of the country.
A problem meriting fuller discussion than would
be appropriate here is the possible influence of
climatic crises on the evolution of religious concepts
in Egypt. There can be little doubt that the climate
of Egypt, with the normally dependable regularity
in the seasonal flooding of the Nile, provided con-
ditions uniquely suitable for the development of
the concept of divine kingship. The predictability
of natural conditions would readily inspire the
people to believe any claims to magic powers and
divinity that a king might make.
Furthermore, there can be little doubt that the
concern expressed by local nomarchs for the ma-
terial wellbeing of their subjects in the First Inter-
mediate Period, and the later Middle Kingdom idea
of the King as a good shepherd watching over his
flock, developed naturally out of the crisis of famine
that impoverished and killed the industrious as well
as the lazy and shiftless, so that poverty could not
be blamed on a deficiency of character.
It is tempting also to link the great increase in
the popularity of Osiris, "a divinity who had him-
self suffered death and resurrection in the process
of transfiguration" (Lloyd 1961 :118) during the
first Dark Age to the nature of the crisis through
which the Egyptians themselves were passing. This
god, "as one of the forces of nature, personified the
growth of plants through the stimulus of the life-
giving water of the Nile" (Smith 1962), both of
which were in critically short supply. Smith fur-
ther notes that Osirian beliefs began to appear in
private tombs about the middle of Dynasty V,
while Gardiner (1961) points out that the Pyramid
Texts of Dynasty VI emphasize Osiris, in contrast
to the Vth Dynasty emphasis on Re. And the Nile
floods, first poetically identified with King Unis,
came in Dynasty VI to be often identified with
Osiris (Cerny 1952). This change coincides with
24 BARBARA BELL [AJA 75
Butzer's dating for the end of the Neolithic Wet
Phase.
Another god whose popularity, or in this case
unpopularity, may have been influenced by the
end of the NWP is Seth. Wainwright (1963, lEA
49) states that Seth is to be considered as originally
a storm god, and of great antiquity (Nagada I),
and thus to have originated well within the NWP,
as "a god of the blessed yet dangerous storm." As
the rains became rare, his rites became only a nui-
sance, and he eventually slipped from his high es-
tate and became the personification of evil. With
the decline of the NWP, everything from the desert
became sinister to the Egyptian peasant. "Out of
the southwestern desert come sandstorms and bad
weather, sent by Seth, Lord of the Libyan Desert.
... The hot south and west winds in summer bring
'the pestilence of the year' which kills people"
(Kees 19 61 :37).
And finally we may note a legend according to
which "Sekhmet, the lioness goddess dwelling in
the desert near Memphis, by order of Re, once de-
stroyed nearly all the first race of men when they
were beginning to make settlements, until the god
saved the remainder by a stratagem" (Kees 1961:
37). It may well be that this legend reflects a dim
and distant memory of an earlier fluctuation to
aridity, or drought, within the NWP.
We conclude with a brief return to the broader
picture of the First Dark Age of Ancient History
outlined in the Introduction. We have considered
in some detail a number of texts from the First In-
termediate Period which clear ly establish that
Egypt was afflicted by severe famine, and that this
famine was caused primarily by failure of the Nile
floods rather than by human negligence. Most of
these texts, and particularly those relating to the
severest drought (tzw-famines), can be dated with-
in a period of no more than SO years, c. 2180 to
c. 2130 B.C. A second drought, less prolonged, and
perhaps less severe, occurred between 2002 and
1991 B.C.
If the more general thesis of a widespread
drought, as set forth in the Introduction, is cor...
rect, it would be the first of these great droughts
which brought an end to EB 2 civilization through-
out the eastern Mediterranean Basin. It would be
the first drought also which in Mesopotamia con-
tributed to the destruction of the Akkadian Em-
pire, and the second drought which contributed to
the downfall of the Third Dynasty of Ur. I plan
to investigate the evidence from Mesopotamia in
detail in a later paper. The conclusions reached in
the present paper should, however, be judged pri-
marily on the internal Egyptian evidence. They do
not depend in any necessary wayan the correctness
of the hypothesis of a Widespread drought.
