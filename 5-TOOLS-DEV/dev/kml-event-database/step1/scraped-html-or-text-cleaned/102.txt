Volcaniclastic tide-modulated tempestite in a coastal tuff ring, Jeju Island, Korea - PubMed

The need for more accurate and extensive records of storm activity is increasing because of growing population and infrastructure in coastal areas. Records of past storm activity have consequently been sought from diverse sedimentary proxies in marginal marine environments, as well as historical documents. In this paper, we introduce a unique record of a 3.7 ka BP storm event preserved in a coastal tuff ring on Jeju Island, Korea. The tuff ring formed mostly above high tide level by primary volcanic processes, but contains three interbeds of horizontally laminated to hummocky/swaly cross-stratified deposits with intervening mud drapes up to an altitude of ~4.6 m above high tide level. These interbeds were formed by wave activity in a swash to surf zone when the sea level rose several meters above normal high-tide level during a storm event, and the triple intercalation of the wave-worked deposits reflects three tidal cycles during a storm event that lasted 1.5 day. Jeju Island contains the most complete record of an ancient storm event ever reported in the tuff ring, and highlights the significance of coastal volcanoes in the study of extreme depositional events in coastal areas, such as storms and tsunamis.

Location of study area. (A) Location of Jeju Island. Tracks of the five largest typhoons that hit the Korean Peninsula in the last half century are indicated. 1 = Sarah, 1959, 2 = Rita, 1972, 3 = Rusa, 2002, 4 = Maemi, 2003, 5 = Chaba, 2016. (B) Geometrically corrected aerial photograph (orthophotograph) of Songaksan, taken by the authors in 2015, consisting of a tuff ring, a nested scoria cone and a ponded lava inside the crater of the tuff ring. The crater rim of the tuff ring is indicated by a dashed line. (C) 3D model of the exposure of the tuff ring along the western coast with the locations of measured localities, which was built by combining hundreds of still images taken with a drone.

Outcrop photographs and thin-section images. (A) An exposure at locality 11 showing a complete sequence of reworked units (R1 to R4) and interbedded primary tuff units (T1 to T5). Unit T3 here is thinly stratified and overlain by a mud drape. It is interpreted to be reworked and is distinguished by a subscript ‘r’ at the end of the unit name. (B) Megaripple-bedded tuff (unit T2) at locality 5, underlain by a mud drape (unit R1) and planar-bedded tuff (unit T1). Unit R2 here is a poorly sorted, crudely stratified, primary tuff, and is distinguished by a subscript ‘p’ at the end of the unit name. (C) The basal 1 cm of the airfall tuff unit T4 at locality 9 is horizontally laminated due to reworking by swash waves, and is distinguished by a subscript ‘r’ at the end of the unit name. (D) Back-scattered electron image of the mud drape of unit R1 at locality 11. (E) Decimeter-deep erosion beneath the low-angle cross-stratified unit R2 at locality 8. Unit T2 is completely removed by erosion. (F) Unit R2 at locality 6 shows a vertical facies change from multiple mud drapes at the base, seaward-migrating ripple formset and high-angle cross-stratification in the middle, well-sorted and horizontally laminated deposits above it, to poorly sorted and crudely stratified primary tuff (R2p). (G) Swaly cross-stratified deposit of unit R2 at locality 15, filling a decimeter-deep scour. Unit T2 is completely removed by erosion probably together with unit R1 and part of unit T1. (H) Back-scattered electron image of a mud drape of unit R4 at locality 9, composed of well-sorted and imbricated silt-size ash. The lower part of the image, also belonging to unit R4, is much coarser-grained and poorer sorted. (I) Hummocky to swaly cross-stratified division of unit R4 at locality 10 sandwiched between horizontally laminated divisions at the base and at the top. The upper division passes laterally into a massive and coarse-grained deposit filling an ebb-related scour hollow. All photo scales are graduated in centimeters.
