Mid-Holocene Falkland Islands bird bones from a peat deposit, including a new species of caracara Mark P. Adams and Robin W. Woods Abstract. The modern avifauna of the Falkland Islands is well documented, but very little is known of the islands before the first recorded human settlement in 1764. Since then, peat was cut and used widely as fuel throughout the Falkland Islands until the late 20th century. From as early as the 1930s bones were noticed in peat deposits on West Point Island and were briefly documented in 1950. This paper provides a more detailed analysis of more recent focused excavations of these subfossil remains. It summarizes their known history and dates them at over 5000 years before present. Eighteen avian species are identified and comparison is made with the extant bird fauna of the Falkland Islands including the description of a new species of caracara (Aves: Falconidae: Phalcoboenus). Additional keywords: birds, peat deposits, Phalcoboenus, subfossil, West Point Island. Received 19 December 2015, accepted 19 February 2016, published online 20 June 2016 Introduction The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) lie in the South Atlantic between latitudes 51°S and 53°S and longitudes 57°30′W and 61°30′W, ~500 km north-east of the nearest point of South America on Tierra del Fuego. They consist of two main islands, East and West Falkland, surrounded by more than 700 smaller islands. West Point Island lies ~500 m off the north-western tip of West Falkland, and it is here that the prehistoric bones described in this paper were excavated. The island covers an area of ~1255 ha, with rugged cliffs up to 370 m high principally on its western and southern coasts, sloping gradually to sea level around much of the eastern coast. Peat formed from low-growing woody shrubs and grasses is widespread throughout the Falklands, with deposits up to 5 m thick, and was cut as fuel at all settlements on the Falkland Islands for at least a century. A large peat bog lies ~1250 m west of the settlement on West Point Island, from which a total depth of 2.7 m has been cut over many years. It is situated on a plateau at an altitude of 67–76 m between Black Bog Hill and Rocky Ridge Hill, both ~150 m high, and appears to be an example of a raised ridge-top mire as described by Clark (1991). It is from this peat bog that large numbers of bird bones have been extracted. Residents of West Point Island have been aware of these bones since discovering them in ~1934 whilst cutting peat for fuel. Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith spent three weeks at West Point Island in early 1950, where he collected a small number of bones from the peat bog; in a resulting publication, Hattersley-Smith and Hamilton stated that the deposit was discovered some 15 or 20 years earlier and that the bones were plentiful. They deduced that as a result of peat cutting the bone deposit was ~2.7 m below the original peat surface, which they hypothesised covered the site of a former large freshwater pond. Today this remains the only known avian bone deposit in the Falkland Islands. In 1962 Roddy Napier, the owner of West Point Island, showed the site to Robin W. Woods, who observed large bones distributed in a depth of at least 30 cm. A selection of these bones was collected, cleaned and sent to the US National Museum, Washington, DC (specimen 557997). Although we have not examined them directly, an image appears to show bone elements from at least seven Striated Caracara (Phalcoboenus australis) individuals that closely resemble bones excavated by Mark P. Adams and RWW between 1996 and 2006. In January 1971 the site was visited by Milton W. Weller whilst investigating ponds of the Falkland Islands, who concurred that the peat bog could have once been a ridge pond and obtained dates for bones sent to him by R.B. Napier and others of 2220 ± 100 years. However, carbon dating samples analysed by Teledyne during the 1970s were measured in ‘gas proportional detectors’, and dating techniques have since greatly improved. The dating of more recently excavated bones using ‘accelerator dating’ methods is discussed in this paper. On 1 January 1996, RWW and RB Napier visited the peat bog specifically to locate the bone deposits; within minutes, several whitened, dry and hard bone elements were found, spread over the weathered and friable dried peat surface. Further elements were located just below the surface in a small layer of vegetable matter. It appeared that the bones in situ were present only in an area a few metres square and any dry bones found over the surrounding surface of the peat had been weathered out and subsequently scattered. In December 1996, ~200 bones were collected in four days by MPA and RWW from this small area of the peat bog for preservation, dating and identification. Another 300 or so bones were collected during further excavations carried out from December 1998 to November 2006. All elements excavated were analysed and are presented here. Caracaras form a subfamily of Falconidae and are found throughout South and Central America and the southern USA. Of the 10 extant species known, only two currently breed in the Falkland Islands: the Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus), the largest extant species, and the slightly smaller Striated Caracara. A further species, the much smaller Chimango Caracara (Phalcoboenus chimango) occurs as a vagrant, recorded six times between the 1950s and 2012. Caracaras are also known from the fossil record, including four or five from the West Indies. These include Caracara creightoni from Cuba and the Bahamas, Caracara latebrosus from cave deposits in Puerto Rico and another possible species, as yet unpublished, from Mona Island. These species were all about the size of the extant Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway). A larger species, similar in size to Caracara plancus, is known from cave deposits on Grand Cayman, and an even larger species, Caracara tellustris from Jamaica. Further species, again all in the genus Caracara, have also been described more recently from mainland South America: Caracara major, a very large species from Uruguay; a possible further, even larger unnamed species from Argentina; and Caracara seymouri, a smaller species from Ecuador and Peru. Among the bones from West Point Island are a few elements that are very similar morphologically to P. australis and C. plancus, but are much larger and not referable to any known species. These are described as a new species in this paper. Methods Excavation procedure The peat bog covers an area of ~1.35 ha. The majority of bones excavated between 1996 and 2006 were in a small area no larger than ~2 m² and at depths no greater than 20 cm below the current surface, but holes dug up to 20 m south of this main site, and at depths of up to 108 cm, have also revealed bones. It is suspected therefore that the bone deposit extends over an area of at least 100 m² at various depths beneath the undulating ground surface of decomposed peat dust, over and through which Marram Grass and Sheep’s Sorrel are spreading northwards at a rate of ~1 m per year. Bone elements were mostly found in isolation from others and the location and position of bones was random, although a few tibiotarsi with femurs, and mandibles with skulls, were still associated. Slowly working across 1 m x 1 m squares, the dense peat was removed carefully by hand, using small trowels, small scrapers and brushes. The top centimetre or two of peat was characteristically hard and dry due to direct exposure to weather, but below this layer, peat was moist, soft and very dense. Bones tended to be associated with a narrow layer of sand and a change in colour and texture of the peat, suggesting some storm-driven sand accumulations and perhaps some temporary change in the vegetation. The bones were relatively abundant here and, having been preserved in this moist substrate, were often soft and fragile. Removal of bones required slow and careful work and the density of the surrounding peat meant that almost the entire element had to be exposed before it could be successfully excavated in one piece. Once exposed to the sun and air, the bones rapidly dried and became extremely brittle. Excess peat was removed from the bones, which were then wrapped in moist tissue paper and sealed in plastic bags, except for four large bones selected as duplicates for radio carbon analysis. In this temporary stable condition, and under licences from the Falkland Islands Government and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, all material was transported to the UK for further cleaning, preservation and examination. Laboratory procedure All specimens were transferred to the bird collections of the Natural History Museum, Tring, UK. The bones were further cleaned of peat and rehydrated where necessary with distilled and deionised water. In order to preserve the still soft elements in a stable condition, a dilute (10%) PVA glue solution was applied by brush and pipette or by soaking. After being left to air-dry at room temperature for 24–48 h, the bones were stable enough to allow handling and detailed examination. Identification of individual skeletal elements was carried out by direct comparison against as many relevant modern specimens as possible. Comparison with specimens held in the extensive avian skeletal collection at the NHMUK yielded in most cases sufficient evidence to permit identification to species level. Where insufficient comparative specimens were available, they were sourced from other museums. Elements were primarily compared against modern specimens of species still extant in the Falkland Islands, in addition to extant continental South American species. Material Preservation of the bones is generally very good; most elements are whole with little or no damage or signs of predation. However, some fragile elements (skulls, sterna or synsacra) were clearly damaged before collection and others during excavation or preservation. Most are stained brown by the peat; those from the surface show evidence of weathering and are paler with usually more worn surfaces. All these bones appear full-grown with little sign of ‘immature’ individuals present. A near-complete set of preserved bone elements of Striated Caracara was returned to the Falkland Islands in 2002 for display in the Stanley Museum. All other material is now held in the bird collection of the NHMUK. Dating of material In order to date the bones accurately, four elements (a tibiotarsus, a carpometacarpus, an ulna and a vertebra) were submitted for dating at the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford University, UK. These elements were collected in 1996 from different parts and depths of the exposed peat, to allow sampling of bones of potentially varying ages. To ensure dating was as accurate as possible, the selected elements were untouched by hand, individually wrapped in aluminium foil immediately after excavation from the peat and not subsequently treated with any preservatives. Bone elements of the new large caracara were compared directly with modern skeletal material from the NHMUK, the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. In order to carry out molecular analysis, a small section of the holotype ulna was removed and analysed; unfortunately DNA amplification proved unsuccessful. Results Radiocarbon dates of bones Radiocarbon accelerator results were successfully obtained for all four elements submitted. The age given is in radiocarbon years Before Present (BP) equivalent to AD 1950: tibiotarsus, 5335 ± 50; carpometacarpus, 5250 ± 50; ulna, 5255 ± 45; vertebra, 5425 ± 55. The average age of the four elements is therefore 5316.25 ± 50 BP, with a maximum range of 280 years between 5200 and 5480 BP. Identification of bone elements Of the bone elements, 495 have been positively identified as avian. These range in size from pipits to geese and include elements from nearly all parts of the avian skeleton. A summary of the species and elements identified is given in Table 1. For nomenclature of anatomical structures, we follow Baumel and Tomek and Bocheński. Unsurprisingly, no mammal bones were found, as there is no evidence that the only native Falkland terrestrial mammal, the Falkland Wolf or Warrah, inhabited West Point Island. New species of large caracara Seven elements from West Point Island are larger and sufficiently different from Striated Caracara to be described as a new species: Systematics Class: Aves. Order: Falconiformes. Family: Falconidae. Subfamily: Falconinae. Genus: Phalcoboenus. Species: napieri, sp. nov. Holotype: Left ulna (distal two-thirds). Collected 3 December 1996 by M.P. Adams and R.W. Woods. Type Locality: Falkland Islands, West Point Island peat bog ~1250 m west of the settlement between Black Bog Hill and Rocky Ridge Hill with a GPS reading of 51° 20.910′S 60° 42.320′W. Bones were excavated from 5–20 cm below the current peat surface. Date: Radiocarbon dates from four Striated Caracara elements excavated from slightly varying depths and within the same excavation site were all from the Holocene, ranging between 5250 ± 50 and 5425 ± 55 BP. Measurements of Holotype: The total length of this damaged ulna (proximal end missing) is 135 mm. Etymology: We have great pleasure in dedicating this new species to Roddy Napier, owner of West Point Island, for his kind permission to excavate this site and for his continued interest, long friendship and generous hospitality. Referred material: Furcula; Mandible; Tarsometatarsus. Diagnosis: All elements resemble those of Phalcoboenus, but are overall larger and more robust. Description and comparison: Larger than any extant caracara species. Morphology of all elements closely resembles those of P. australis and C. plancus though are larger in all proportions. Elements can be attributed to the genus Phalcoboenus by the following characters: Ulna, distal end: posterior margin of condylus dorsalis joins gradually with the shaft which is characteristic of Phalcoboenus, rather than joining abruptly as in Caracara. The crest of the tuberculum carpale is angular and robust, again characteristic of Phalcoboenus, rather than rounded as found in Caracara. The length from the distal end to the ‘nutrient foramen’ shows it to be 36.3% on average greater than P. australis and 38.8% greater than C. plancus. Furcula, none of the three elements is complete. However, the overall large size is evident. Mandible, one left and one right articular end only. In dorsal view, crista transversa fossae flatter and relatively broad as in P. australis rather than more ‘U’-shaped as in C. plancus. Tarsometatarsus, right tarsometatarsus, trochlea metatarsi III and IV present only. Discussion Existence of bone deposit Hattersley-Smith and Hamilton suggested that the peat bog covers the site of a former large freshwater pond. The reasons for the presence of the large bone deposit within the peat remain unclear. Results from the bone assemblage show that the conditions in the Falklands around 5000 years ago were similar to those today. Species composition in deposit The majority of species identified in the deposit are extant as breeding birds in the Falkland Islands. The notable exceptions are Aplomado Falcon, which occurs widely across mainland South America, but is a rare vagrant to the Falkland Islands, with only four records between 1993 and 2010, and the new caracara. Despite the limited material recovered, we are confident in placing this new species in the genus Phalcoboenus.
