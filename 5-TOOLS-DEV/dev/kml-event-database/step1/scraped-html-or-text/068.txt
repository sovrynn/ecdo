Recent studies of Great Ran of Kachch and Nd \u0026amp;amp; Sr isotopic measurements suggest that a distinct source of water (Sarasvati River) may have been present before 10000 years. Later in Holocene, under a drying climate, sediments from the Thar Desert probably chocked the signature of an independent Sarasvati like river. The new research undertaken by IIT, Kanpur and Imperial College, London has also concluded that Sarasvati River might have been dried up around 8000-12000 years ago. Based on these scientific findings, IITK\u0026amp;#39;s Prof Rajiv Sinha and his team claimed that \u0026amp;quot; Our paper clearly demolishes the age-old river-culture hypothesis that assumed that the disappearance of the river triggered the demise of the Harappan civilization. This has clearly been demonstrated by the large difference in age data between the demise of the river (8000-12000 years ago) and the peak of mature civilization 3000-4000 years ago. \u0026amp;quot; The study of IITK also suggests that between 15000 and 8000 years ago the Sutlej River avulsed (migrated) to its present day course to the northwest. The abandonment of the former course left a topographic low formed by the former channel in the landscape. The Dating of the sediments in the palaeochannels was done by IITK using a technique known as Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL). It may be noted that the OSL method is not an accurate method and therefore, the date arrived by the OSL method may be an underestimate of ~10%.","author":[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Person","name":"Vedveer Arya"}],"contributor":[],"dateCreated":"2018-05-06","dateModified":"2018-05-06","headline":"The Date of the Disappearance of Rigvedic Sarasvati River and Post-Vedic Sarasvati River","image":"https://attachments.academia-assets.com/56498712/thumbnails/1.jpg","inLanguage":"en","keywords":["Hinduism","Landscape Archaeology","Hindu Studies"],"publisher":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","name":null},"sourceOrganization":[{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"EducationalOrganization","name":null}],"thumbnailUrl":"https://attachments.academia-assets.com/56498712/thumbnails/1.jpg","url":"https://www.academia.edu/36572454/The_Date_of_the_Disappearance_of_Rigvedic_Sarasvati_River_and_Post_Vedic_Sarasvati_River"}</script><link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="//a.academia-assets.com/assets/single_work_page/loswp-4e3d039261950d4b4b1a4aa831b9fce420f969e92cf016bd1a7151245032ceae.css" /><link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="//a.academia-assets.com/assets/design_system/body-8d679e925718b5e8e4b18e9a4fab37f7eaa99e43386459376559080ac8f2856a.css" /><link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="//a.academia-assets.com/assets/design_system/button-3cea6e0ad4715ed965c49bfb15dedfc632787b32ff6d8c3a474182b231146ab7.css" /><link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="//a.academia-assets.com/assets/design_system/text_button-73590134e40cdb49f9abdc8e796cc00dc362693f3f0f6137d6cf9bb78c318ce7.css" /><link crossorigin="" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" rel="preconnect" /><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:ital,opsz,wght@0,9..40,100..1000;1,9..40,100..1000&amp;family=Gupter:wght@400;500;700&amp;family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@300;400&amp;family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20,400,0,0&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet" /><link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="//a.academia-assets.com/assets/design_system/common-2b6f90dbd75f5941bc38f4ad716615f3ac449e7398313bb3bc225fba451cd9fa.css" />

(Annex A) Archaeological work done during the last two decades calls for a re-look at the present-state of knowledge about the civilization and the relationship between so-called Neolithic cultures and Ironworking regions of Ancient India, in the context of the phases of Sarasvati Civilization (generally restricted to the Sarasvati River basin in NW India, consistent with the names such as Indus Valley or Harappa Civilization). It has been shown that reference to Ganga Basin and Brahmaputra Basin occur in R ̥ gveda. Unfortunately, these have not received adequate attention. I submit that the Copper Hoard Culture normally identified with the Ganga-Yamuna doab relates to these Ganga and Brahmaputra River Basins which were inhabited by people of Sarasvati Civilization, contemporaneous with the 2000+ settlements identified on the Sarasvati River Basin, west of Rakhigarhi. I submit that further researches should focus on iron ore belts of India, considering the fact that over 8000 Indus Script Inscriptions are wealth accounting ledgers, metalwork catalogues. It is clear that iron smelting work was in progress not later than 1800 BCE in Ganga River Basin.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Study of Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Hindu civilization.

Vimal Singh and SK Tandon in a geomorphological evaluation of the Pinjaur dun note that 1) the Himalayan orogenic belt, formed as a result of collision tectonic processes, shows abundant evidence of neotectonic activity, active tectoics, and the occurrence of historical earthquakes; and 2) Himalaya&#39;s frontal formation zone is characterized, in some segments, by intermontane longitudinal valleys (duns). Discussing a particular Pinjaur dun in NW Himalaya, the authors note that the dun is developed and marked by three mountain fronts: MF1A and MF1B associated with the southermost Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), MF2 associated with the Sirsa fault, and MF3 associated with the Barsar thrust along the southern margin of the relatively higher main part of the sub-Himalaya. The authors underscore the important drainage divide separating the Sirsa and Jhajara drainage networks. Remarkable river deflections are aligned linearly over tens of kilometers in a zone about 10 km. south of the HFT. In a fascinating analytical framework using structural and geomorphological approaches, the authors postulate &quot;the formation of an incipient mountain front that is evolving ahead of the HFT and the outermost Siwalik hills.&quot; I suggest that this formation of the incipient mountain front is exemplified by the deflection, by a virtual U-turn of Sutlej River at Ropar (Rupnagar) during the historical periods. The crux of the geomorpholocal challenge is to date this deflection of Sutlej. The study notes that the ongoing collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate has resulted in the southward migration of the Himalayan front and associated landforms with time.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Matching geomorphological study of Pinjaur dun with the archaeological reality of 90-degree deflection of Sutlej River at Ropar&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:37670196,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/12446522/Matching_geomorphological_study_of_Pinjaur_dun_with_the_archaeological_reality_of_90_degree_deflection_of_Sutlej_River_at_Ropar&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/12446522/Matching_geomorphological_study_of_Pinjaur_dun_with_the_archaeological_reality_of_90_degree_deflection_of_Sutlej_River_at_Ropar"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div><div class="ds-related-work--container js-wsj-grid-card" data-collection-position="2" data-entity-id="37817119" data-sort-order="default"><a class="ds-related-work--title js-wsj-grid-card-title ds2-5-body-md ds2-5-body-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/37817119/%E0%A4%87%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8_History_of_Hindu_Civilization_7th_to_4th_millennium_BCE">इतिहास History of Hindu Civilization 7th to 4th millennium BCE</a><div class="ds-related-work--metadata"><a class="js-wsj-grid-card-author ds2-5-body-sm ds2-5-body-link" data-author-id="66817162" href="https://dcpune.academia.edu/SrinivasanKalyanaraman">Srinivasan Kalyanaraman</a></div><p class="ds-related-work--abstract ds2-5-body-sm">इतिहास --Tin-Bronze Revolution, 4th millennium BCE. Sarasvatī navigable Himalayan glacial waterway linked seafaring metal merchants on the Ancient MaritimeTin Route between Hanoi (Vietnam) and Haifa (Israel) -- Rakhigarhi, Hariyūpiyā Principal paṭṭaṇa, riverine port cities; तृत्सु Tr̥tsu of Sarasvatī Civilization are Yamunā dwellers -- Sarasvatī Himalayan glacial river, in Rgveda, identity of locality हरि-यूपीया as Harappa and Rakhigarhi as principal paṭṭaṇa, riverine ports -- Yamunā-dwellers Tr̥tsus glorified Indra; Tr̥tsu, white-robed, with braided hair, skilled in song Bon Chiang (Thailand) artifacts using the thermoluminescence technique resulted in a range from 4420 BCE to 3400 BCE, which make the site the earliest Bronze Age culture in the world. A hypothesis is posited that this fifth millennium BCE site evidences that a Maritimje Tin Route which linked Hanoi (Vietnam) and Haifa (Israel) existed in 4th millennium BCE, supplying the resources of tin from the largest tin belt of the globe (in the basins of navigable waterways of Himalayan rivers Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween) gave the impetus to the Tin-Bronze Revolution. This monograph provides evidences for the role played by guilds of artisans/seafaring merchants of Sarasvati Civilization using Brahmaputra and Ganga as transit navigable waterways documenting (using Indus Script hypertexts) the wealth-production activities for the newly found metalwork products, sustaining and promoting this Ancient Maritime Tin Route which predated the Silk Road by two millennia. Astronomy has dated Mahabharata events with astonishing precision (Narahari Achar&#39;s work). Dwaraka submergence is REAL and mentioned in the epic, Krishna tells yadava to move out. Sangam text attests to 42 generations of Velir from Dwaraka. Images of Balarama and Krishna are on ancient coins. That the region of Sarasvati-Sindhu river basins was subject to frequent earthquakes caused by plate tectonics of the Indian plate moving northwards jutting into European plate at the pace of 6 cms. per year (lifting up the Himalayan ranges by 1 cm per year), is also attested in the Mahabharata epic which documents the enormity of the earthquakes and records the engulfing of Dwaraka by seawaves and submergence of Dwaraka. The migration of River Yamuna carrying the waters of Glacial Sarasvati from Paonta Saheb to join the Ganga creating Triveni Sangamam and themigration of River Sutlej by a 90-degree turn at Ropar, to join the Sindhu river, cut off the glacial perennial waters to Vedic River Sarasvati. Thus, the Sarasvati River become a monsoon-based river with stretches of breaks in the navigable channel and the creation of saras, &#39;lakes&#39; in the regions of Haryana and Rajasthan. The snapping of the navigability of the River Sarasvati impacted the seafaring merchants of Meluhha who had crossed the Persian Gulf beyond Dholavira-Surkotada in Rann of Kutch to conduct maritime trade. The snapping of trade connections led to migrations of people eastwards and southwards as evidenced by the settlements of Rakhigarhi (near Delhi) and Daimabad on Pravara River, a tributary of River Godavari. That the migrations occurred southwards is attested in Purananuru, a Sangam text in Tamil. Recurrent earthquakes caused by plate tectonics are also indicated in ancient texts. For example, after Krishna’s atman departs the mortal body--- विवृद्ध मूशिकारथ्या विभिन्नमणिकास्तथा केशानखाश्च सुप्तानामद्यन्ते मूशिकैर्निशी (MBh., Mausala, 2.5) चीचीकूचीति वाशन्ति सारिका वृष्णिवेश्मसु नोपशाम्यति शब्दश्च स दिवारात्रमेव हि (MBh., Mausala, 2.6) अन्वकुर्वन्नुलूकानाम् सारसा विरुतं तथा अजाः शिवानाम् विरुतमन्वकुर्वत भारत (MBh., Mausala, 2.7) Streets swarmed with rats and mice, earthen pots showed cracks or were broken from no apparent cause, sarika_s chirped ceaselessly day and night, sa_ras hooted like owls, goats cried like jackals, pigeons departed from their homes, and asses brayed aloud in disconsonant and awful voices (Ganguly, 1998). निर्याते तु जने तस्मिन् सागरो मकरालयः द्वारकां रत्नसंपूर्णं जलेन प्लावयत् तदा (MBh., Mausala, 7.41) तदद्भुतमभिप्रेक्ष्य द्वारकावासिनो जनाः तूर्णात् तूर्णतरम् जग्मुरहो दैवकितिब्रुवन् (MBh., Mausala, 7.43) The sea, the abode of monsters, engulfed the gem-filled Dwraka with waves soon after the people departed the place. Seeing this astounding incident, the citizens of Dwaraka ran away, exclaiming, ‘O, our fate’. (Ganguly, 1998). Reference to Dwaraka as Thuvarai in an ancient Sangam text Ayasipur is a Vedic expression. अयस् n. iron , metal RV. &amp;c अयस्मय (अयोमय) a. (-यी f.) Ved. Made of iron or of any metal. -यी N. of one of the three habita- tions of Asuras. pur पुर् f. (Nom. sing. पूः; instr. du. पूर्भ्याम्) 1 A town, fortified town; thus ayasipur refers to a fortification made of stone or metal. (पूरण्यभिव्यक्तमुखप्रसादा R.16.23) துவரை² tuvarai, n. See துவாரகை. உவரா வீகைத் துவரை யாண்டு (புறநா. 201). துவாரகை tuvārakai, n. &lt; dvārakā. The capital of Kṛṣṇa on the western side of Gujarat, supposed to have been submerged by the sea, one of catta-puri, q. v.; சத்தபுரியுளொன் றாயதும் கடலாற்கொள்ளப்பட்ட தென்று கருதப்படுவதும் கண்ணபிரான் அரசுபுரிந்ததுமான நகரம். This Vedic expression ayasipur is consistent with the description of Dwaraka in Purananuru as a fortification with walls made of copper (metal). இவர் யார் என்குவை ஆயின் இவரே ஊருடன் இரவலர்க்கு அருளித் தேருடன் முல்லைக்கு ஈத்த செல்லா நல்லிசை படுமணி யானைப் பறம்பின் கோமான் நெடுமாப் பாரி மகளிர் யானே தந்தை தோழன் இவர் என் மகளிர் அந்தணன் புலவன் கொண்டு வந்தனனே நீயே வட பால் முனிவன் தடவினுள் தோன்றிச் செம்பு புனைந்து இயற்றிய சேண் நெடும் புரிசை உவரா ஈகைத் துவரை யாண்டு நாற்பத்து ஒன்பது வழி முறை வந்த வேளிருள் வேள விறல் போர் அண்ணல் தார் அணி யானைச் சேட்டு இருங்கோவே ஆண் கடன் உடைமையின் பாண் கடன் ஆற்றிய ஒலியற் கண்ணிப் புலிகடிமாஅல் யான் தர இவரைக் கொண்மதி வான் கவித்து இரும் கடல் உடுத்த இவ் வையகத்து அரும் திறல் பொன்படு மால் வரைக் கிழவ வென் வேல் உடலுநர் உட்கும் தானைக் கெடல்அரும் குரைய நாடு கிழவோயே ! If you ask who they are, they are his daughters, he who granted cities to those who came in need and earned great fame for gifting a chariot to the jasmine vine to climb, he who owned elephants with jingling bells, the lord of Parampu, the great king Pāri. They are my daughters now. As for me, I am their father’s friend, a Brahmin, a poet who has brought them here. You are the best Vēlir of the Vēlir clan, with a heritage of forty nine generations of Vēlirs who gave without limits, who ruled Thuvarai with its long walls that seemed to be made of copper, the city that appeared in the sacrificial pit of a northern sage (Yaja). King who is victorious in battles! Great king with garlanded elephants! Pulikatimāl with a bright garland who knows what a man’s responsibility is, and what you can do for bards! I am offering them. Please accept them. Lord of the sky high mountain that yields gold! You whose strength cannot be equaled on the earth that is covered by an arched sky and surrounded by the ocean, you whose army puts fear into enemies with victorious spears! O ruler of a land that can never be ruined! Irunkovel is supposed to be 49th generation of a king from (Thuvarai) Dwaraka. It can mean two things. Assuming about 30 years per generation, 1500 years earlier Dwaraka which had walls made of copper. Dating the early phase of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization to ca. 3500 BCE, and the submergence of Dwaraka to ca. 1900 BCE (a date indicative of the drying up of Vedic River Sarasvati due to migrations of Sutlej and Yamuna rivers which were tributaries bringing in glacier waters), which necessitated the movements of Sarasvati&#39;s children down the coastline to Kerala, this text places Sangam literature text of Purananuru to ca. 400 BCE. (Source: http://historum.com/asian-history/76340-satyaputras-earliest-indo-aryanizers-south-india-3.html Migration from Tuvarai (Dwaraka) is attested in a 12th century inscription (Pudukottai State inscriptions, No. 120) cited by Avvai S.

As e-book on Pothi.com as ebook7538 at Rs.300/- **** This book is a sequel to the book ‘Chitpavan Konkanastha Brahmins’ History [Pre- And Proto-]’. Like the previous book, it further takes the story to its final logical conclusion. It shows categorically that the Original Home of the Chitpavan Brahmins’ ancestors was right on the banks of the ancient Vedic River Sarasvati, near its origin in the Himalayas in the region now known as Uttarakhanda of India. This book was possible owing to impromptu feedback by Dr. Ambujkishore Jha, MBBS, from Mumbai. He came across my Chitpavan Origins Book on academia.edu. After reading it, he said that he was very much impressed and wrote to me a mail. These details are furnished in this book at appropriate places. As informed by him, the historic narration is due Mr. Ramakrishna Jha, his grandfather, a scholar of Vedic History. He had passed on the history to Dr. Jha. This would not be an isolated piece of history related to their own ancestors who were domiciled on the Sarasvati River banks, at its origin in the Vedic times. The Chitpavan Brahmins ancestors were called ‘Agnihotri Brahmins’ then and were the neighbours of the Maithili Brahmins’ ancestors in the region to their north-east as narrated. In the book on Chitpavan Brahmins Origins of this author, it was seen that the historic connection to Ahichhatra, with due evidence, was provided by the Kannada Shashtik Brahmins who shared common ancestry with Chitpavan Brahmins. In this case, it is the Maithili Brahmins, one time old neighbours of the Chitpavan Brahmins’ ancestors for long since ancient Vedic times, who have come forward to provide the missing link to their ancestral history by emphatically providing the necessary evidence and connection of their ancestral home on the banks of the Vedic Sarasvati River in the Himalayas. This author finds the hand of providence in this discovery of the roots of the Chitpavan Brahmins and their ancestry. Had it not been the chance of meeting a longtime friend Mr. K. R. Kodiyal from Dombivli, this author may not have known the Pre-history of Chitpavan Brahmins’ ancestors from the Kannada sources.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link

metrological terms,names of vedic ornaments,names of people, places and gods etc. My perception is that only a comprehensive study of ancient vedic metrology can decipher the script symbols satisfactorily. A significant find herein is the existence of the Kalinga malla mana system during Harappan times challenging the common perception of its origin from the later Kalinga kingdom(Orissa).The unicorn is identified as the pala/nishka/soma/agni.Signs of intersecting circles, fish , crab,bud,tower etc. also indicate pala.The six locks of hair indicate the paNameTa weight of six barley grains.Roots and nuts indicate viira bhadra/ Drupada/ varaha/pala.We have located Lord Krishna’s Mathura and Dvaraka in the Indus valley scripts. We have confirmed Mohenjodaro as the first Dvaraka on the basis of the inscription on the copperplate B7C2 from there and textual evidences from the Rgveda, Mahabharata etc.We have located PadmakuuTa,one of the palaces of Krishna there.Also we have identified the Sindhu(Indus) as the Vedic Sarasvati river.We have gone through the symbols identifying the Bharadvajas,the clan of composers of the earliest vedic texts.In Krishna’s Dvaraka we gathered more details from the script on Lord Krishna’s Dvaraka and Sindhu/Sarasvati. We have looked into the indications of the Harappan jar symbol with three forks on each edge.We have located the Kasyapas in Hastinapura trading with Sumeria.We have decoded the Mari Standard,went deeper into the meanings of several Sumerian images and confirmed Meluhha as Vedic Harappa/Indus valley. We have located Janaka,the king of Mithila,father-in-law of Rama, in the Indus script.We have identified the names of copper in the Indus script and located the Asvins,Yama and Skanda in the Indus script.In A Model For Indus Script Decipherment we have identified the deity in the seal M-1181 and built a model for complete decipherment of the Indus script. We have seen how Brahmi and Kharoshthi evolved from the Indus Script and how the Indus script was in use along with Brahmi/Kharoshthi even into the first centuries CE.We have seen how the coins of the ancient world,including the Roman coins evolved from the Indus valley money. We have looked for and located a Rosetta Stone for the Indus script, in the varaha/gadyanaka coin form. We have gone into the relation of the Druids to the Indus valley civilisation and the role of their Gundestrup cauldron in the evolution of Christianity. We have explored the relation of the Anau seal to the Indus Valley Civilisation. We have gone into the relationship of the Egyptian and Harappan deities. We have looked into a beautiful story from the New Testament invoving the vedic soma sacrifice in A Veiled Visvamitra Soma Sacrifice In The New Testament. We have studied the indications of some of the Indus script symbols with particular reference to their use on ancient coins of India . We have looked into symbolism of the overflowing vase on the Sumerian statue of Gudea and through it we identified the indications of several Indus symbols including the Harischandra vaajapeya sacrifice. We have seen how the Harappan glyphs served as goodluck symbols . The identification of the right vedic soma has two important aspects:First, it ends the long quest for the mysterious soma. Second,it confirms the Indus valley civilisation as vedic ,beyond any doubt. We have studied the vedic Daksha Yaaga and its relation to the soma yaaga.Also we have located Dāśarājñá and Dasaratha in the Indus seals. We have explored the application of the palm seals as further rosetta stones of the Indus script . We have looked into the claim of mlecca as the language of the Indus valley civilation and concluded that Bharata,not mlecca, was the language of the Indus valley civilisation. We have gone into the shift of the vedic Yadava clans from the Ghaggar-Hakra to the Sarasvati(Sindhu) basin. In this article we are confirming the river Sindhu as the vedic river Sarasvati.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;The Script Of Indus Valley Civilisation-16 Vedic Sarasvati-Ganga Civilisation&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:50933664,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;docx&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/30494516/The_Script_Of_Indus_Valley_Civilisation_16_Vedic_Sarasvati_Ganga_Civilisation&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/30494516/The_Script_Of_Indus_Valley_Civilisation_16_Vedic_Sarasvati_Ganga_Civilisation"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div><div class="ds-related-work--container js-wsj-grid-card" data-collection-position="6" data-entity-id="36704803" data-sort-order="default"><a class="ds-related-work--title js-wsj-grid-card-title ds2-5-body-md ds2-5-body-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/36704803/The_Date_of_the_Lost_Cities_of_Dvaravati_Dwarka_and_Atlantis">The Date of the Lost Cities of Dvaravati (Dwarka) and Atlantis</a><div class="ds-related-work--metadata"><a class="js-wsj-grid-card-author ds2-5-body-sm ds2-5-body-link" data-author-id="3214667" href="https://independent.academia.edu/VedveerArya">Vedveer Arya</a></div><p class="ds-related-work--abstract ds2-5-body-sm">Modern historians had already concluded that the references of the lost city of Dvaravati or Dwarka in Indian literature and the references of the lost city of Atlantis in Greek literature are mythical. But the new researches in Indian and world chronology clearly indicate that the civilizational history of ancient nations has arguably commenced in the beginnings of Holocene. I have established based on the archaeo-astronomical evidence in my article titled &quot; From Manu to Mahabharata &quot; that the early Rigvedic period had commenced around 14500 BCE. According to the genealogy of the Yadu dynasty given in Puranas and the chronological information available in various historical legends and the reference of Ghora Angirasa in Chandogya Upanishad, Devakiputra Krishna flourished around 11100-11020 BCE. Interestingly, Rishi Vasishtha relates the story of Devakiputra Krishna to Ikshvaku King Dilipa, an ancestor of Sri Rama as recorded in Padma Purana (4.13.8 ff). Valmiki Ramayana refers to the legend of Narakāsura Vadha. Nammalvar, the 5 th Tamil Vaishnava saint (born in 3173 BCE) and Andal (born in 3075 BCE) wrote poems dedicated to Lord Sri Krishna. Andal composed two poems in which she expressed her love for Sri Krishna. She imagined herself as Gopi of Sri Krishna. Evidently, Lord Sri Krishna was well established as Vishnu&#39;s incarnation before Mahabharata era. There are numerous references of Krishna as incarnation of Vishnu in Mahabharata. Udyoga Parva (48) refers to Krishna as Narayana.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;The Date of the Lost Cities of Dvaravati (Dwarka) and Atlantis&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:56644645,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/36704803/The_Date_of_the_Lost_Cities_of_Dvaravati_Dwarka_and_Atlantis&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/36704803/The_Date_of_the_Lost_Cities_of_Dvaravati_Dwarka_and_Atlantis"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div><div class="ds-related-work--container js-wsj-grid-card" data-collection-position="7" data-entity-id="12073968" data-sort-order="default"><a class="ds-related-work--title js-wsj-grid-card-title ds2-5-body-md ds2-5-body-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/12073968/Search_for_Sarasvati_based_on_mistranslations_and_misrepresentations_to_buttress_Marxist_ideology_to_distort_Hindu_traditions">Search for Sarasvati based on mistranslations and misrepresentations to buttress Marxist ideology to distort Hindu traditions</a><div class="ds-related-work--metadata"><a class="js-wsj-grid-card-author ds2-5-body-sm ds2-5-body-link" data-author-id="662769" href="https://independent.academia.edu/SriniKalyanaraman">Srini Kalyanaraman</a></div><p class="ds-related-work--abstract ds2-5-body-sm">Historians and scientists have to contend with the reality substantiated by the presence of 80% (of 2600 archaeological sites) of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization sites on Sarasvati River Basin which had maritime contacts with Mesopotamia, another doab civilization of Tigris-Euphrates river basins. Presence of cylinder seal in Kalibangan attests to this contact between ancient India and Mesopotamia. Celebration of Triveni sangam every 12 years in Kumbha mela is an abiding Hindu tradition -- NOT mythology -- and it is for historians and scientists to find the factual basis for this tradition which is founded on knowledge systems. Witzel had mistranslated Baudhayana Srautasutra of Taittiriya Shakha school of the Krishna Yajurveda (ca. 6th century BCE) to buttress his false theory of Aryan invasion/migration. The sutra simply stated two migrations from Sarasvati river basin 1) towards Ganga basin and 2) towards Iran. pran Ayuh pravavraja. Tasyaite Kuru-Pancalah Kasi-Videha ity. Etad Ayavam pravrajam. Pratyan amavasus. Tasyaite Gandharvarayas Parsavo ‘ratta ity. Etad Amavasavam. (BSS18.44:397.9 sqq) Translation: Ayu migrated eastwards. His (people) are the Kuru-Pancalas and the Kasi-Videhas. This is the Ayava (migration). Amavasu migrated westwards. His (people) are the Ghandhari, Parsu and Aratta. This is the Amavasu (migration). Similarly, Irfan Habib misquotes geologist Marie-Agnes Courty to buttress his false theory of mythical Sarsuti river to paint the pariyatra along River Sarasvati, of Balarama described in Salyaparva of Mahabharata as a myth. It has been proved that this pariyatra was a historical event of ca. 3000 BCE) by 1) reconstructing (using planetaria software of NASA) the 150+ astronomical details provided in the epic; and 2) identifying about 2000 archaeological sites on Sarasvati river basin of what is called Harappan culture.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Search for Sarasvati based on mistranslations and misrepresentations to buttress Marxist ideology to distort Hindu traditions&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:37396320,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/12073968/Search_for_Sarasvati_based_on_mistranslations_and_misrepresentations_to_buttress_Marxist_ideology_to_distort_Hindu_traditions&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/12073968/Search_for_Sarasvati_based_on_mistranslations_and_misrepresentations_to_buttress_Marxist_ideology_to_distort_Hindu_traditions"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div><div class="ds-related-work--container js-wsj-grid-card" data-collection-position="8" data-entity-id="12113168" data-sort-order="default"><a class="ds-related-work--title js-wsj-grid-card-title ds2-5-body-md ds2-5-body-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/12113168/Drishadvati_Ghaggar_Hakra_River_archaeological_evidence_points_to_ca_2500_BCE_as_the_start_date_for_the_desiccation_of_Vedic_River_Sarasvati">Drishadvati-Ghaggar-Hakra River: archaeological evidence points to ca. 2500 BCE as the start date for the desiccation of Vedic River Sarasvati</a><div class="ds-related-work--metadata"><a class="js-wsj-grid-card-author ds2-5-body-sm ds2-5-body-link" data-author-id="662769" href="https://independent.academia.edu/SriniKalyanaraman">Srini Kalyanaraman</a></div><p class="ds-related-work--abstract ds2-5-body-sm">The density of settlements along the Vedic River Sarasvati Basin is exemplified by the fact that 80% (of 2600 archaeological sites, including 414 sites mapped along Hakra River Basin and over 300 sites of Gujarat) of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) aka Indian Valley Civilization. While geological time is measured in long time periods starting Pleistocene geological epoch from 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, archaeological time allows for more shorter time spans to recognize culural phases with various classifications such as chalco-lithic, neolithic, bronze age cultures etc. Thus, to pin down the date of the desiccation or drying up of Vedic River Sarasvati (which seems to be a recent proto-historic event from ca. 5000 years ago) in vast stretches of North-west India can be reconstructed historically using both geological and archaeological markers of settlement clusters or artifact indicators such as architectural features of fortifications, water reservoirs, irrigation canals, resources and products traded, metals, alloys, tools, implements, weights, seals indicating a developed writing system to communicate messages. Sarasvati River system is sequenced as Sutlej-Markanda-Drishadvati-Ghaggar-Hakra river channels which constituted the hydrological flows of Vedic Sarasvati River system traceable upstream: from 1. Sarasvati creek starting from Ad Badri at the foothills of the Siwalik ranges and 2. extending into the Bata Valley in upper reaches of the Himalayas, traceable into the Rupin-Supin glaciers close to Yamunotri glaciers. Another glacier source from Manasarovar yielded the Riverf Sutlej which was a tributary of Vedic Sarasvati River System joining the latter southwards from Ropar at Shatrana (50 km. south of Patiala). At Shatrana, the width of the discernible river bed is about 20 kms and the average width of he palaeo-channels is about 6 km across the whole length from the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;Drishadvati-Ghaggar-Hakra River: archaeological evidence points to ca. 2500 BCE as the start date for the desiccation of Vedic River Sarasvati&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:37426587,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/12113168/Drishadvati_Ghaggar_Hakra_River_archaeological_evidence_points_to_ca_2500_BCE_as_the_start_date_for_the_desiccation_of_Vedic_River_Sarasvati&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/12113168/Drishadvati_Ghaggar_Hakra_River_archaeological_evidence_points_to_ca_2500_BCE_as_the_start_date_for_the_desiccation_of_Vedic_River_Sarasvati"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div><div class="ds-related-work--container js-wsj-grid-card" data-collection-position="9" data-entity-id="33410440" data-sort-order="default"><a class="ds-related-work--title js-wsj-grid-card-title ds2-5-body-md ds2-5-body-link" href="https://www.academia.edu/33410440/The_Aryan_Invasion_Theory_The_Final_Nail_in_its_Coffin_From_a_Chapter_in_Advancements_of_Ancient_Indias_Vedic_Culture">The Aryan Invasion Theory: The Final Nail in its Coffin (From a Chapter in &quot;Advancements of Ancient India&#39;s Vedic Culture&#39;</a><div class="ds-related-work--metadata"><a class="js-wsj-grid-card-author ds2-5-body-sm ds2-5-body-link" data-author-id="65391677" href="https://independent.academia.edu/DwivendraDubey">Dwivendra Dubey</a></div><p class="ds-related-work--abstract ds2-5-body-sm">The Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) is the idea that the Vedic people were not indigenous to the area of northern India, but were invaders from the Caucasus Mountain region that descended on India around 1500 BCE, and then wrote the Vedic literature and forced the natives to accept their culture. In writing this chapter I want to emphasize that this book is not about the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT), but we should at least include one chapter on it to show its place in discovering the real history of the development of ancient India and the origins of Vedic culture. In doing so, I acknowledge there have already been volumes written on this controversial topic, and on where the original homeland of the Indo Aryans might be. So anyone can read any of those books until one is nauseated with various viewpoints, but that is not what we are going to do here. Going into a long dissertation about how all the theories were developed and what evidence they found is the last thing I want to do. For all but the specialist researchers and readers, it would make for an extremely tedious book, at least more so than some may feel it is already. So, we are only going to summarize some of the most recent and concluding research that is available today. Let us remember that the idea that the Vedic Aryans came from outside of ancient India and entered the region to start what became the Vedic civilization is a foreign idea. There was never any record, either historical, textual or archeological, that supports this premise for an Aryan invasion. There also is no record of who would have been the invaders. The fact is that it is a theory that came from mere linguistic speculation which happened during the nineteenth century when very little archeological excavation had yet been done around India. There have been many researchers who have tried to study the linguistics of the people to gather an indication of where the original homeland of the Vedic Aryans was actually located. This was done to either try to uphold or refute the idea of the Aryan Invasion Theory. In my book, Proof of Vedic Culture&#39;s Global Existence, I dealt with linguistics and word similarities to a degree, but this topic, in spite of all the research, study, and books written on whatever findings were made, has done little to absolutely establish with clarity the original home of the Vedic Aryans. Some scholars have always felt that the linguistic evidence is not sufficient to draw definite conclusions where the homeland of the Vedic Aryans was located. Linguistics amongst some scholars have always been a speculative process, at best arriving at various conjectures about the origins of particular cultures and languages. Others have been even more dismissive of the idea of reconstructing a 1 hypothetical language based on words that remain present in spoken languages thousands of years later. Thus, in trying to understand the Vedic Aryans and where their homeland may have been by analyzing some hypothetical Proto-Indo-European language that still has not been identified seems rather doubtful. At best, it may provide some basic hypothesis, which in reality may be most misleading. This also seems to say that there is little reason to hold the field of linguistics in such a high degree of respect, considering all the books that have been written that seem to use this process to determine so many conclusions, or conjectures, on the homeland of the Vedic Aryans. As a further comment to this issue, G. P. Singh relates, &quot;They (proponents of the Aryan Invasion Theory) are divided in their opinion regarding the exact location of the said common home, the reason for which is not far to discover. The speakers of Aryan languages have been clubbed together as an Aryan race which never existed as such.</p><div class="ds-related-work--ctas"><button class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;wsj-grid-card-download-pdf-modal&quot;,&quot;work_title&quot;:&quot;The Aryan Invasion Theory: The Final Nail in its Coffin (From a Chapter in \&quot;Advancements of Ancient India&#39;s Vedic Culture&#39;&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:53464063,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;docx&quot;,&quot;work_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.academia.edu/33410440/The_Aryan_Invasion_Theory_The_Final_Nail_in_its_Coffin_From_a_Chapter_in_Advancements_of_Ancient_Indias_Vedic_Culture&quot;,&quot;alternativeTracking&quot;:true}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">download</span><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">Download free PDF</span></button><a class="ds2-5-text-link ds2-5-text-link--inline js-wsj-grid-card-view-pdf" href="https://www.academia.edu/33410440/The_Aryan_Invasion_Theory_The_Final_Nail_in_its_Coffin_From_a_Chapter_in_Advancements_of_Ancient_Indias_Vedic_Culture"><span class="ds2-5-text-link__content">View PDF</span><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 18px" translate="no">chevron_right</span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="ds-sticky-ctas--wrapper js-loswp-sticky-ctas hidden"><div class="ds-sticky-ctas--grid-container"><div class="ds-sticky-ctas--container"><button class="ds2-5-button js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;continue-reading-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:56498712,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}">See full PDF</button><button class="ds2-5-button ds2-5-button--secondary js-swp-download-button" data-signup-modal="{&quot;location&quot;:&quot;download-pdf-button--sticky-ctas&quot;,&quot;attachmentId&quot;:56498712,&quot;attachmentType&quot;:&quot;pdf&quot;,&quot;workUrl&quot;:null}"><span class="material-symbols-outlined" style="font-size: 20px" translate="no">download</span>Download PDF</button></div></div></div><div class="ds-below-fold--grid-container"><div class="ds-work--container js-loswp-embedded-document"><div class="attachment_preview" data-attachment="Attachment_56498712" style="display: none"><div class="js-scribd-document-container"><div class="scribd--document-loading js-scribd-document-loader" style="display: block;"><img alt="Loading..." src="//a.academia-assets.com/images/loaders/paper-load.gif" /><p>Loading Preview</p></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="scribd--no-preview-alert js-preview-unavailable"><p>Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
