Abstract and Figures
Based on archaeological excavations, 217 samples were collected from the Luotuodun Site. Of them 63 samples from the section plane of the site layer were used for identification analysis of foraminifera, plant debris and seed fossils, and four samples were used for 14C dating and relevant analysis. Through many kinds of experiments, we have drawn some conclusions. Firstly, benthic foraminifera, such as Ammonia compressiuscula and Ammonia cff. sobrina, are found in the 10th layer, indicating that between 7500 and 5400 BC, i.e. before the emergence of the Majiabang Culture, Luotuodun Site and its nearby regions had ever experienced a marine transgression event. Secondly, we have found 450 plant fossils in this site, such as Polygonum sp., Scripus sp., Najas sp., Physalis sp., which indicated lacustrine or swamp environment.

Abstract:  Based on archaeological excavations, 217 samples were collected from the Luo-
tuodun Site. Of them 63 samples from the section plane of the site layer were used for iden-
tification analysis of foraminifera, plant debris and seed fossils, and four samples were used 
for  14C dating and relevant analysis. Through many kinds of experiments, we have drawn 
some conclusions. Firstly, benthic foraminifera, such as Ammonia compressiuscula and 
Ammonia cff. sobrina, are found in the 10th layer, indicating that between 7500 and 5400 BC, 
i.e. before the emergence of the Majiabang Culture, Luotuodun Site and its nearby regions 
had ever experienced a marine transgression event. Secondly, we have found 450 plant fos-
sils in this site, such as Polygonum sp., Scripus sp., Najas sp., Physalis sp., which indicated 
lacustrine or swamp environment.

The relationship between man and environment is one of the most important research fields 
of the past global changes. But without any written records, it is difficult to evaluate the in-
fluences of environmental change on human societies in the prehistoric times. Cultural sites 
are the perfect research materials for the interactions between environmental change and 
human civilization. Therefore, environmental archaeology on the cultural sites during the 
Neolithic Age is important to address this issue. 
The area surrounding Taihu Lake is one of the important cradles of ancient culture in 
China, as revealed by accumulated lines of archaeological data. In this region, the distribu-
tion of Neolithic cultural sites is excessive and concentrated. Cultural layers, cultural inter-
... Excavations revealed a large central settlement of the Majiabang Culture, as well as cultural relics of the Songze, Liangzhu and Guangfulin Culture in the Luotuodun site (Nanjing Museum Archaeological Research Institute, 2003;Nanjing Museum and Yixing Cultural Heritage Administration Committee, 2009). Previous studies have found that there is a 50-centimetre-thick peat layer with pottery pieces under the Majiabang cultural layer (Supplementary Figure S1) (Li et al., 2009;Li, 2011). ...
... Polygonum is also an important taxon in marshland environments (Ge et al., 2019). Li et al. (2009) identified a total of 413 plant fossils in the peat layer at the Luotuodun site, which contains a large number of Polygonum seeds. Additionally, the high C/ N ratios of peat sediments, which have a fibric or hemic appearance and substantial plant-derived contributions, are significantly higher than ...
... This is because Sr typically substitutes for Ca in carbonate minerals and is more geochemically reactive than Rb . Complementary evidence from profile T5033 within the Luotuodun site corroborates the human-marsh interaction: The peat layer beneath the cultural layer (9th layers) is interspersed with pottery pieces, which began at 7212 ± 55 cal yr BP (2σ) (Supplementary Figure S1) (Nanjing Museum Archaeological Research Institute, 2003;Li et al., 2009;Li, 2011). Therefore, we attribute the changes in Mz and Rb/Sr ratio to anthropogenic disturbance in the marshland, which led to the degradation of marshlands and the intensification of soil erosion. ...

... Therefore, it was only during the Liangzhu Cultural period that domestic animals became the main meat source for the Neolithic people. The NTAXA of edible wild plants changed slightly from the Majiabang Cultural period (15) to the Songze Cultural period (8) and the Liangzhu Cultural period (14). In contrast, the NTAXA of wild animals drastically declined from the Majiabang Culture (49) to the Songze Culture (9) and to the Liangzhu Cultural period (25), which was especially highlighted by the NTAXA of freshwater animals and land mammals ( Table 2). ...

... Ten composite 14 C dates (Table 2) were used to construct an age-depth model for core LTD-12 ( Supplementary Fig. S2). Four samples of core LTD-12 were directly dated by using the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14 C technique, while the other six dates were cited from a parallel profile T5033 (Li et al. 2009). Rubidium contents of these two Fig. 1 Rainfall patterns within the EASM domain during the Holocene synthesized by our study. ...
... The dating samples of core LTD-12 were prepared in the laboratory of Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and 14 C was measured by the State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Technology, Peking University. The cited ages were dated using either conventional or AMS methods (CASS 1992;Li et al. 2009;Song et al. 1997). All 14 C dates were calibrated to calendar years according to the software CALIB version 7.0.4 using the IntCal13 curve (Reimer et al. 2013). ...
... The ages of fossil pollen samples were calculated by linear interpolation or extrapolation. Although some of the dates were based on total organic carbon (TOC) which may suffer from old-carbon effects (Grimm et al. 2009), previous comparison with optically stimulated luminescence dating has confirmed their reliability (Li 2011). ...

... These ridges have formed at intervals during the mid-and late Holocene (Liu and Walker, 1989;Yan et al., 1989) as a result of major storm events (Xu, 1997) and have formed barriers against sea-level rise and marine inundation since the early mid-Holocene. The delta began forming about 7000 years ago as a result of postglacial sea-level readjustment (Hori and Saito, 2007;Hori et al., 2002;Song et al., 2013), before which marine conditions had penetrated well to the west of the area, including west of current Lake Tai at Luotuodun (Li et al., 2009). Since its formation the deltaic lowland has been prograding eastwards (Chen, 1996;Hori et al., 2001) and the delta east of the chenier ridges has only formed in recent millennia (Chen and Zong, 1998). ...

... Previous studies have attributed the saltwater sediments of this period to direct transgression due to high sea level (Liu et al., 2015;Shu et al., 2010;Xiong et al., 2020;Zong et al., 2007), which spread to areas not affected by seawater before 7500 cal yr BP, such as the Luotuodun site in Yixing, northwest of the Taihu Plain (Li et al., 2009). Recent global observations published by Lambeck et al.

... The climate was then warm and humid during the Liangzhu cultural period, while the climate in the Guangfulin cultural period was increasingly cool and dry, with a relatively harsh en-vironment, although the temperatures between the Warring States Period and the Han Dynasty were relatively high. Based on the archaeological excavations of the Luotuo-dun Site in Yixing, Jiangsu, Li et al. [136] combined the 14C dating data of samples from four related strata and made foraminifera, plant clast, and seed fossil identifications for 63 samples in the stratigraphic profile of the site, finding one genus and two species of benthic foraminifera in the 10th peat layer, namely, Ammonia compressiuscula and a sim-ilar type that is a close relative of Ammonia. Ammonia is euryhalic and is a common species in brackish water near the intertidal zones of modern coasts. ...
