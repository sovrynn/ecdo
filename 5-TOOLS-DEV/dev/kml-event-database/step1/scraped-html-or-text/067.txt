Abstract
Twenty-eight 14C dates were obtained from 90 cores drilled through the tidal flats of western Andros Island, a large area (2000 km2), mostly covered by mangroves and stromatolitic deposits. These dates are correlated with location of the samples, sedimentological description, position of the samples at the time of deposition and their present-day sedimentological position. Measurements were made on bulk algal sediments and location of the relative paleo-sea-level is inferred from paleobathymetric reconstructions.
On the basis of 14C dates, I conclude that the whole area was flooded about 5000 years BP and then was covered by the subtidal greyish mud facies, rich in Peneroplids, in the area of Deep Creek (north of the study area), Pelican Creek and Wide Opening (southeast of the study area). The level of this paleo-Great Bahama Bank Sea continued to rise until 3500 years BP and then slowly fell asymptotically toward the present-day level.
Thick hurricane marks (aragonitic lime mud with Didemnids spicules, several cm thick), previously defined as hurricane trails, can be observed throughout the cores, from 2000 years BP onwards. From 2000 years BP onwards it seems that the modern physiography was already established, including tidal estuaries, channels and stromatolite-bearing swamps.
Paleogeographic maps and sections have been drawn, and accumulation rates calculated in the various sedimentological zones of the tidal flats of western Andros. These vary between 0.5 to 0.04 mm/yr.
The modern topography of the tidal flats was established by 2000 years BP; similarly, the modern geological features, controlled by a tropical climate strictly dependent on hurricanes, were already established by 2000 years BP and seem to have been initiated between 2500 and 2000 years BP.
Introduction
In this paper I will describe additional features of the Bahama Bank area that can be attributed to the influence of tropical cyclones and hurricanes (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1998). This influence has been most intense during the last 2000 years. Building on that, I will also present a model for the middle to late Holocene (ca. 5000 years) sedimentary deposition on western Andros Island of the Great Bahama Bank. This envisions a higher stand of sea-level at about 3000 years BP followed by a slow fall to present sea-level. This higher sea-level has been documented in other parts of the world (Flood and Frankel, 1989, Beaman et al., 1994, Baker and Haworth, 1997, in Australia, Fletcher and Jones, 1996, Grossman and Fletcher, 1998, on Hawaiian Islands, Jedoui et al., 1998 in Tunisia, Blum et al., 2001 in Texas), despite the generally accepted curve for North American Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico (Curray, 1960, Shepard, 1963, Scholl et al., 1969, Frazier, 1974, Belknap and Kraft, 1977, Parkinson, 1989, Thomas, 1990, Toscano and Lundberg, 1998, Rodriguez, 1999) and for Australia (Thom and Roy, 1983, Woodroffe et al., 1990).
The results of radiocarbon dating of a set of cores collected from carbonates deposited in the mangroves of western Andros Island adds to a series of studies carried out in the same region on sedimentology and diagenesis (dolomitization) of the mangroves, and, of the hydrology and diagenesis related to hurricanes (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1973, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1990, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1998).
The questions to be raised are the following: (1) has the dolomitized supratidal mud been deposited by slow Holocene sea-level rise, as Bahamian tidal flat histories are usually presented (Hardie, 1977), under the control of a sea-level that began lower than the present (Scholl et al., 1969, Pardi and Newmann, 1987, Gornitz and Seeber, 1990); or, (2) have they been deposited under the control of a sea-level higher than the present followed by a fall to present level and affected by stronger hydrodynamic agents as a result of intensification of hurricanes?
Another objective of my paper is to alert workers in the Bahamian area to the possibility of alternative scenarios for relative sea-level effects over the Late Holocene.
As shown by Blum et al. (2001), a Mid-Holocene highstand around many tropical, i. e. low latitude sites outside North America can have many causes: glacio- and hydro-isostatic crustal deformation (Clark et al., 1978, Clark and Ligle, 1979, Nakada and Lambeck, 1988, Tushingham and Peltier, 1991; Lambeck, 1993, Fleming et al., 1998, Peltier, 1998). In addition, changes of sea-level during Middle to late Holocene could also be related with paleoclimate changes during the same period between 5.7 to 3.2 ka (Denniston et al., 1999), or as recorded in ice core and other records (Dechamps et al., 1988, Stuiver et al., 1995, Bond et al., 1997, Zhang et al., 2000, Moustafa et al., 2000), specially changes in Antarctic ice volume (Sowers et al., 1993, Goodwin, 1998, Ingolfsson et al., 1998, Leuschner and Sirocko, 2000), with thermal expansion of the ocean waters as revealed by satellite altimetry (Chen et al., 1998, Minster et al., 1999, Cazenave, 1999). This higher stand of Mid-Holocene sea-level could explain peculiar sedimentological observation such as the disappearance of branching corals (Acropora) between 3030 and 3005 Cal BP in the Caribbean province) demonstrated by Hubbard et al. (2005) or the bank-top transition from non-skeletal- to skeletal-dominated deposition around 3.8 ka and a contemporaneous change in the abundance of transported allochems as observed by Dix and Kyser (2000). A middle Holocene relative sea-level highstand, estimated at 2 m above present mean sea-level, has been also pointed out in Mississippi Delta (Curray, 1961, Nelson and Bray, 1970, Penland et al., 1991, Törnqvist et al., 2004).
Detailed sedimentological studies of the Andros Island area were carried out by Ginsburg and Hardie (1975), and then by Hardie (1977). Lowenstam and Epstein (1957), Neumann and Land (1975), Steinen et al. (1988), Macintyre and Reid (1992), Milliman et al. (1993), Friedman (1994), Milliman (1994), Robbins et al. (1997), concentrated their discussions on Bahamian aragonite mud origins. Gebelein and Hoffman (1973), and Gebelein, 1974, Gebelein, 1975, Gebelein, 1977, Gebelein, 1978, Gebelein et al. (1980) and Rankey (2002) focused on the tidal flat of western Andros.
In other studies of the Bahamas, Newell and Rigby (1957), Newell et al. (1959), Cloud (1962), Shinn et al. (1965), Traverse and Ginsburg (1966) and Boardman et al. (1989) used bulk material for radiocarbon dating with success. Their work tabulated sedimentation rates on the Great Bahama Bank, and also recorded a number of ancient Holocene dates for the supratidal and intertidal sediments of the tidal flats.
The author has studied Bahamian carbonate environments and deposits for a number of years (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1974a, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1974b, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1976, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1990, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1998), and that work forms part of the basis for the present paper. Some terms used below are detailed in her previous work as noted in the discussion.
Located between 24°20 N and 24°50 N, and 78° W and 78°30 W, the tidal flat covers an area of approximately 50 km × 40 km (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Rainfall can exceed 50 mm per day during eight months of the year and up to 160 mm per day during four months. It causes important dilution in the surficial water bodies of the tidal flat (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1979, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1981).
Around Andros Island, several broad sedimentary zones have been recognized, and are described in Table 1 after Bourrouilh-Le Jan (1990). Six present-day sedimentary facies can be identified in the area. These and their characteristics are tabulated in Table 2. Identification of these various zones and facies in sediment cores (Fig. 2) provides the data upon which this paper is based.
The deposits of the various zones are altered by the chemistry of the water saturating or adjacent to them. The character of these fluids can induce early dissolution of aragonite (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1998). The deposits are also altered by marine currents and cyclonic overflow that erodes earlier deposits of the north-northwest zone, which themselves are no longer built-up by hurricanes because of their position in the lee of the typical hurricane's path.
The tidal flat acts as a sediment filter during high-energy sedimentary events, such as hurricanes and tropical cyclones (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1998). These are common features of the Bahamian climatic regime.
The Bahama archipelago is in the pathway of hurricanes and tropical cyclones of the North Atlantic. Hurricanes differ in scale from tropical cyclones and are defined as tropical depressions with winds higher than 118 km/h (74 mph) acting on a 1600 km diameter, and with heavy rainfall. Tropical cyclones and hurricanes are initiated in the equatorial zone, near the west coast of Africa (Cry, 1965, Neumann et al., 1978). Fig. 2 includes a wind rose for hurricane tracks which have been listed and drawn from the meteorological Bureau of Great Britain and the U. S. Weather Bureau, Washington D.C., in previous papers (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982). In addition, this wind rose for hurricane tracks on the western part of Andros island explains the distribution of Pine pollens (Traverse and Ginsburg, 1966) and of whitings (Robbins et al., 1997) on the Great Bahama Bank, which are both localized north and northwest of Andros Island.
Detailed analysis of the western Andros Island tidal flats permitted identification of hummocks as hurricane-generated features, or “hurricane trails” (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1976, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1980, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982, location of sections and samples in Fig. 2). The hurricane tracks wind rose (Fig. 2) coincides with statistical directions of morphologic axes of low hills colonized by Sabal palm trees (palm hummocks) of the tidal flats (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1978, Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982; Fig. 3), and covered by continental fauna and flora. Viewed from space, these weak topographic undulations appear as “V”-shaped sedimentary bodies, opening towards the northwest and northeast quadrant, and correspond statistically to hurricane paths that pass over Andros (see Fig. 11 later in text). Such features have been recently observed in the Pleistocene Bahamian interglacial substage 5e in different locations of the banks or in Bermuda (Hearty et al., 1998, Kindler and Strasser, 2000). These V-shaped sedimentary bodies are made by the pile-up of centimetric layers of cryptocrystalline aragonitic mud which become dolomitized with time (Fig. 4). So, the hurricane sedimentary action is scattered, scarce, discontinuous, with patches of few centimetric white mud layer on few square meters across the tidal flats and in relation with reworking of scattered ponds and tidal basins where cyanobacterial mats cannot develop and protect the mud from a hurricane disturbance. These supratidal muddy patches are visible in field (Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 1982, Figs. 3 and 4, and 1990) but cannot be seen through remote-sensing data (Rankey et al., 2004).

General statement
Geomorphic features of the Andros Island tidal flat which are controlled by high-energy climatic events, include “tidal estuaries", according to local English vocabulary, (Wide Opening, Pelican Creek, Deep Creek, etc.), tidal channels and basins, beach levees, lakes and ponds, swamps and hurricane trails (Fig. 4). The tidal flat is covered by two main types of vegetation: continental Sabal palm forest and mangrove forests (Rhizophora and Avicenia) cover more than 80% of the tidal flat. The term
Methods
Sedimentological analyses include core x-radiographs, thin sections (cores were sectioned and resin-impregnated), mineralogy (XRD) and geochemistry (UV emission spectrography, for 23 elements). Twenty-eight 14C dates (Table 3) were obtained on inter- to supratidal facies of the tidal flat of western Andros Island. In order to compare the results with those of a more unequivocal marine environment, a date was obtained from a core located in one of the large tidal straits (Middle Bight) that cuts
Mid-Holocene sea-level highstand
Radiocarbon-dated sediments (Table 3) from the tidal flat of western Andros Island were correlated with sample location, sedimentological description, position at the time of deposition and present-day sedimentologic position. The facies have changed little vertically and the dominant estuarine facies consists of grey mud with numerous subtidal Peneroplids (Androsina lucasi, Lévy, 1977), e.g. deposits in the estuaries of Deep Creek, Pelican Creek and Wide Opening. The physiography has changed
Lateral variations in intertidal to supratidal facies
Shinn et al. (1965) dated nine samples: – a Cerion, gastropod shell, and – eight sediment samples (dolomite and a mixture of carbonates). But the date obtained on the gastropod shell (1690 years BP) that occurs below one of the sediment samples, was not taken into account by these authors. The following new interpretation (Fig. 6) is that: (a) there is a continuity between the sediments and the dolomitic crust, and (b) — there are lateral variations of facies that are repeated vertically, the
Conclusions
The climatic consequences show that the sedimentary processes (accretion and diagenesis) controlled by high-energy phenomena (tropical cyclones and hurricanes), seem to have followed a Mid-Holocene transgression culminating about 3000 years BP and have become established in the Bahama archipelago beginning between 2500 and 2000 years BP.
Contrary to the generally accepted ideas, the Mid-Holocene sea-level on the Great Bahama Bank was higher than the present-day and situated at about + 1.5 m. The

    Citation Excerpt :

    Small disparities in the timing (on the scale of a few hundreds of years) and amplitude (by up to + 2 m) of the highstand between these areas are inferred to result from hydro-isostatic effects and mantle rheology (Woodroffe and Horton, 2005; Milne et al., 2009; Stattegger et al., 2013). These new limits as to the timing of the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand in the Persian Gulf also compares favourably with previously proposed, though, often, less well-constrained, ages for the transgressive and regressive phases from SE Asia (Geyh et al., 1979; Woodroffe and McLean, 1990; Chappell and Polach, 1991; Tjia, 1996; Scoffin and Le Tissier, 1998; Yim and Huang, 2002; Stattegger et al., 2013), Australia (Flood and Frankel, 1989; Beaman et al., 1994; Baker and Haworth, 2000; Baker et al., 2001; Collins et al., 2006), the Pacific (Grossman et al., 1998; Nunn and Peltier, 2001) and the Atlantic (Gayes et al., 1992; Compton, 2001; Angulo et al., 2006; Bourrouilh-Le Jan, 2007; van Soelen et al., 2010) regions (Table 5). Many of these previous studies have been unable to decouple proposed eustatic sea-level changes from the signature of local and far field tectonic adjustments (Milne et al., 2009).
