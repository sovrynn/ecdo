Although extreme-wave events are frequent along the northwestern coast of Western Australia and tsunamis in
1994 and 2006 induced considerable coastal flooding locally, robust stratigraphical evidence of prehistoric trop-
ical cyclones and tsunamis from this area is lacking. Based on the analyses of X-ray computed microtomography
(μCT) of oriented sediment cores, multi-proxy sediment and microfaunal analyses, optically stimulated lumines-
cence (OSL) and 14
C-AMS dating, this study presents detailed investigations on an allochthonous sand layer of
marine origin found in a back-barrier depression on the NW Cape Range peninsula. The event layer consists of
material from the adjacent beach and dune, fines and thins inland, and was traced up to ~ 400 m onshore.
Although a cyclone-induced origin cannot entirely be ruled out, the particular architecture and fabric of the
sediment, rip-up clasts and three subunits point to deposition by a tsunami. As such, it represents the first
stratigraphical evidence of a prehistoric, mid-Holocene tsunami in NW Western Australia. It was OSL-dated to
5400–4300 years ago, thus postdating the regional mid-Holocene sea-level highstand.

1. Introduction
The NW coast of Western Australia is impacted by 1–2 tropical
cyclones per year, and ten tsunamis have been recorded since 1858,
including those following the 1883 Krakatoa eruption and the earth-
quakes off the coast of Indonesia in 1977, 1994 and 2006 (Goff and
Chagué-Goff, 2014). Although observations during these tsunamis are
rather sporadic, wave heights of ~6 m (Cape Leveque) and a run-up of
~8 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) (Shelter Bay, Shark Bay) locally
occurred during the 1977 Sumba and 2006 Java tsunamis, respectively
(Prendergast and Brown, 2012; Goff and Chagué-Goff, 2014). At the
North West Cape, the 1994 Java tsunami overwashed the dune barrier
at Baudin (Fig. 1), 3.6 km S of the study area. Inundation extended up
to 300 m inland, and a run-up of ~ 7 m AHD was inferred (Gregson
and van Reeken, 1998). In addition, tropical cyclones cause extensive
coastal flooding. As one of the most powerful cyclones in Australia's
historical record, category 5 tropical cylone Vance (March 18th–22nd,
1999) resulted in water levels of ~7 m above event tide in the Exmouth
Gulf (Nott and Hubbert, 2005). However, little is known about the
geological imprint of historical (Prendergast and Brown, 2012; May
et al., 2015a) and prehistorical extreme-wave events in northwestern
Western Australia. So far, prehistorical tsunamis or storms were
inferred from corals or large molluscs in washover deposits and dunes
up to 1 km inland, or from marine organisms attached to wave-
emplaced boulders (Scheffers et al., 2008, and references therein).
These findings lack stratigraphic contexts, and uncertainties related to
radiocarbon dating of reworked marine organisms (May et al., 2015a)
or the marine palaeo-reservoir effect may bias the inferred
chronologies.
This paper provides, for the first time, detailed stratigraphic
evidence of a prehistoric extreme-wave event from northwestern
Western Australia. Based on multi-proxy sediment and microfaunal
analyses, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and 14
C-dating, an al-
lochthonous sand layer of marine origin was identified in a mud-filled
back-barrier depression at the NW coast of the Cape Range peninsula.
As a novel approach in the context of tsunami deposits, X-ray computed
microtomography (μCT) scans of oriented cores reveal characteristic
sediment fabrics, which have been described from modern (Wassmer
et al., 2010) and historical (Cuven et al., 2013) tsunami deposits but
are rarely preserved in palaeotsunami deposits. We discuss the origin
of the event layer against the background of its sedimentary character-
istics and the local sedimentary environment.

2. Physical setting
Investigations were carried out in the low-lying back-barrier zone at
Ninety Mile Beach access (21°50′28.03″S, 114°2′54.06″E), located in the
northwestern part of the NW Cape (Western Australia). The site com-
prises a circular mudflat some 200 m from the sea, and slightly elevated
low and open shrublands (Fig. 1). A dune belt of ~ 5 m AHD separates
the site from the Ningaloo Reef, the local producer of bioclastic skeletal
fragments. Heavy winds, sustained rainfall and severe flooding are
mainly related to tropical cyclones during summer. The post-glacial
marine transgression approached its maximum at ~ 7000–6000 years
BP, when the formation of the Ningaloo Reef off the NW Cape had just
started (Collins et al., 2003). A relative sea-level (RSL) highstand of
1–2 m above present level followed by a marine regression is docu-
mented for several coastal sections of Western Australia (Lewis et al.,
2013; Engel et al., 2015) and is also assumed for the NW Cape.
The continuously falling RSL resulted in low sedimentation rates in
coastal settings since c. 5000 years, impeding the accumulation of
sediment archives suitable for storing palaeo-wave events (Nott,
2004). However, although its deposits have not yet been presented,
the 1994 Java tsunami explicitly showed that considerable flooding of
near-coast sediment archives may occur (Gregson and van Reeken,
1998), and palaeotsunami and palaeocyclone deposits may be stored
in topographical lows.
3. Methods
3.1. Sedimentary analyses
Samples were taken from cores and trenches at 16 locations along a
shore-perpendicular transect crossing a circular mudflat (Fig. 1) at
Ninety Mile Beach access, starting at c. 200 m from the coast. The strat-
igraphical transect comprises trenches T7, T20 and T35, T36 and 38, per-
cussion cores VC31–34 and push cores C3 (master core; Fig. 2), 22–25,
27 and 37. Percussion cores were taken using an Atlas Copco Cobra
Pro percussion corer and probes of 6 cm in diameter. Push cores were
taken by pushing plastic tubes also with a diameter of 6 cm into the sed-
iment by hand. Cores and trenches reached depths between 50 and
150 cm below surface (b.s.), and sediment recovery amounted to a min-
imum of 90% during coring. The distance between sampling sites was
between 5 and 50 m. Percussion cores and trenches were photographi-
cally documented and significant facies were sampled. Push cores were
opened and sampled in the lab in steps of 0.5–1 cm. Elevation of the
cores and profiles were measured using a Topcon HiPer Pro differential
global positioning system (DGPS) with an altimetric accuracy of ~2 cm.
Elevations given in AHD (Australian Height Datum) are based on DGPS
measurements using the static mode and AUSPOS post-processing.
Modern samples were taken from the present beach (EXM B), the
dune (EXM D) and the lagoon some 450 m off the beach (i.e., the
Holocene reef platform, TTB).
The coarse- and fine-grained fractions (N2 mm and b 2 mm) were
separated using a 2 mm sieve and weighed; percentage of the gravel
fraction (N 2 mm) is separately illustrated for master core C3. The air-
dried fine-grained fraction was carefully hand-pestled for particle
disaggregation. Grain size distribution of the fine-grained fraction was
measured using a Beckman Coulter LS 13320 laser particle analyser
(b2 mm). Samples were pre-treated with H2O2 (30%) to remove organic
carbon and 0.5 N Na4P2O7 (55.7 g/l) for aggregate dispersion. Statistical
measures were calculated after Folk and Ward (1957) using the
GRADISTAT software (Blott and Pye, 2001). In order to determine
sedimentary environments and sediment source areas, microfaunal
analyses (foraminifers, ostracods) were carried out for samples of
master core C3 and for the modern samples. Samples (10 cm3 ) were
pre-treated with H2O2 (30%) for dispersion and sieved to isolate fractions
of N100 and b100 μm. The microfaunal content was investigated under a
binocular microscope and quantitatively recorded. A minimum of ~300
(foraminifers) and ~100 (ostracods) specimens per sample were count-
ed where possible. We distinguished reworked and non-reworked

foraminifers based on the degree of fragmentation and abrasion/
rounding. For determination taxa and ecological preferences, Yassini
and Jones (1995), Hayward et al. (1999), De Deckker and Yokoyama
(2009), and Karanovic (2012) were used.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using the
PAST software (Hammer et al., 2001) for samples of master core C3
(Fig. 3). For PCA, the grain size parameters mean, sorting, skewness
and kurtosis as well as the percentage of microfaunal contents were
included. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to avoid
autocorrelations.
We interpreted μCT scans of an oriented push core (C37) in order to
infer information about sediment fabric as well as flow directions and
characteristics. Scans were performed at HECTOR, a custom-built CT
scanner setup at UGCT (Centre For X-ray Tomography, Ghent University,
Belgium) (cf., Masschaele et al., 2013). The CT scanner was specifically
designed for multidisciplinary CT applications and is built around a
240 kV X-RAY WorX microfocus source (XWT 240-SE) and a Perkin-
Elmer flat panel detector (1620 CN3 CS). Based on the sample size and
composition, optimal scanner settings were determined to be 220 kV
tube voltage, 50 W beam power and 1 mm of aluminium filtration to
reduce beam hardening while preserving a sufficiently high signal-to-
noise ratio. A total of 2000 projections was recorded, with a 1-second
exposure per projection. The isotropic voxel pitch of the reconstructed
volume was 50 μm. The tomographic datasets were reconstructed
using the Octopus software package, and the reconstructed 3D volumes
were rendered using the visualisation software package VGStudio MAX.
Visual interpretation was performed using myVGL 2.1 software.
In addition, quantification of sediment fabrics such as the orientation
and dip of the longest axes of particles and particle shape measurements
(Figs. 4, 5) was performed using ImageJ, Blob3D (Ketcham, 2005) and
Stereo32 (Röler and Trepmann, 2013) software. Three sections of the
reconstructed core (lower parts of subunits I and II) were chosen for
subsampling and sediment fabric analyses. The original scans (images)
were cropped and oriented towards the north using ImageJ software.
Subsequent processing included adjustments of brightness and contrast
as well as corrections of the signal-to-noise ratio in order to extract
larger particles and remove smaller ones from the images. Subsamples
were extracted from the whole dataset and transferred into Blob3D.

Subsample I (basal layer of unit B; base of subunit I, trc; cf., Fig. 4)
included 360 images, subsample II (lower to middle part of subunit
I) 500 images, and subsample III (lower part of subunit 2) 400 images.
The grayscale images were converted into a binary image and the
threshold value between black and white was determined to 172.
Subsequently, particle correction and separation was done by using
the “remove islands” and “remove holes” function of Blob3D and,
finally, manually with the separation module of Blob3D. Analyses
were stopped when a total of at least 300 particles per sample were
measured. Finally, the shape of the ellipsoidal particles was calculated
using Stereo32 for each subsample using the major axes of particles
extracted in Blob3D. Particle isotropy (I) and elongation (E) are based
on eigenvectors S1 (max), S2 (intermediate) and S3 (min), calculated
using Stereo32 software.
3.2. Dating techniques
Three OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) samples were taken
from trenches T36 (T36 OSL 1, 15 cm b.s.) and T38 (T38 OSL 1; 36 and
70 cm b.s.). OSL dating was performed at the Cologne Luminescence
Lab (CLL; Institute of Geography, University of Cologne). To estimate
environmental dose rates (Table 1), assessment of U, Th and K concen-
trations by means of high-resolution gamma spectrometry and mea-
surement of in situ water contents were performed on grab samples
of the material within a 30-cm radius around the dated sample. In
case of T36 OSL 1, where the sampled layer has a thickness of only
30 cm, an additional dose rate sample was taken from the mudflat
below and considered in the calculation of the total dose rate. In addi-
tion, the contribution of the cosmic dose rate was calculated on the
basis of geographical position, altitude above sea level, and thickness
and density of the sediment overburden (Prescott and Hutton, 1994).
Comparison of the decay activities of different nuclides within the
238
U and 232
Th chains reveals disequilibria in the range of 12–22% for
the 232
Th chain and 5–15% for the 238
U chain. For the final luminescence
ages these disequilibria are insignificant compared to 1-sigma uncer-
tainties of about 10%, since the related age differences are significantly
smaller, as already documented (e.g., Olley et al., 1996).
Samples for burial dose determination were collected in opaque
aluminium tubes and processed under subdued red light. Samples
were sieved to fractions of 150–200 mm and chemically pre-
treated with HCl, H 2 O 2 , sodium oxalate and HF to remove carbonates,
organics, clay and the alpha-affected rim of the grains. Pure quartz
was extracted by heavy liquid separation with densities of 2.62 and
2.68 g/cm 3 . Small 1-mm aliquots of quartz were measured on Risø
TL/OSL devices with 90 Sr/ 90 Y beta sources delivering ~ 0.08 to
0.15 Gy/s at the sample position. Signals were stimulated by means
of blue LEDs for 40 s and a Hoya U340 filter (7.5 mm) was used for
signal detection.
Equivalent dose measurements followed the SAR protocol of Murray
and Wintle (2003). Since a combined dose-recovery-preheat-plateau
and thermal transfer test (measurement of four aliquots per tempera-
ture interval after bleaching by blue LEDs for 100 s at room tempera-
ture) exemplarily performed on T36 OSL 1 showed no dose–
dependence for temperatures between 180 and 280 °C (transfer of
charge b 0.5% of natural D e and dose–recovery values of 0.94–0.98), a
preheat temperature of 200 °C was selected for all D e measurements
(Fig. 6). The general suitability of the applied SAR protocol for the sam-
ples was verified by (i) dose recovery tests with measured to given dose
ratios of 0.94–0.98 that revealed reproducibility; (ii) linear-modulated
luminescence (with linearly increasing stimulation energy over a
measurement interval of 3600 s) which demonstrates the dominance
of an easily bleachable fast component (photon-ionisation cross-section
of 1.6–1.8 × 10−17
) comparable to the one described by Singarayer and
Bailey (2003); and (iii) constant D e (t) plots that point to thermally
stable signals (Bailey, 2003).
Out of 48 measured aliquots per sample, between 37 and 45 aliquots
passed the SAR acceptance criteria in respect of recycling ratio (0.9–1.1),
recuperation (b5% of De), depletion ratio (0.9–1.1), and signal to back-
ground ratio (N3) and could be considered for the calculation of burial
doses. Due to the approximately normally distributed (skewness b2)
and moderately scattered (overdispersion of 16–25%) De distributions
(Fig. 7), all samples were assumed to be well bleached and, in conse-
quence, the central age model (CAM) of Galbraith et al. (1999) was
used for burial dose calculation. The respective dose values, statistical
characteristics of the D e distributions, and ages for each sample are
summarised in Table 2.
A mollusc and a plant remain were dated by 14 C (Table 3). The
mollusc test has been transported prior to deposition. 14 C-ages were
corrected for a marine reservoir effect of ΔR = 65 ± 18 where necessary
(O'Connor et al., 2010) and calibrated using CALIB 7.0 software (Hogg
et al., 2013; Reimer et al., 2013) (Table 3).

visible for unit B.

4. Sedimentology
4.1. Trench-scale grain size and microfaunal characteristics
At the base of C3, laminated sandy mud (31–24 cm b.s., Figs. 2, 3)
shows layers of one to few mm thickness and mean grain size values
between 4 and ~100 μm. The foraminiferal assemblage (Fig. 2) is mainly
composed of well-preserved individuals of Adelosina longirostra,
Quinqueloculina seminula and Quinqueloculina sp. Juvenile and adult
Cyprideis australiensis, Paracypris sp., Paracytheroma sp., Xestoleberis sp.
compose the ostracod assemblage.
Unconformably overlying is coarse to medium sand with abundant
foraminifers, shell debris and well-rounded gravel (24–6 cm b.s., unit
B). A medium sand layer (24–22 cm b.s.; base of subunit B-I) comprises
the bottom section. Coarse sand and gravel contents increase
from 22–20 cm b.s. and decrease between 20–17 cm b.s (top of subunit
B-I). Between 17–11 cm b.s., massive sand and gravel was found,
coarsening-up at 17–12 cm b.s. and fining-up at 12–11 cm b.s. (subunit
B-II). The sediment lacks any gravel component and is fining-up at
10–6 cm b.s. (subunit B-III).
Samples from unit B cluster based on the PCA and the sorting/mean
grain size ratio (Fig. 3). Granulometric characteristics are similar to the
beach and dune (EXM B and D), although the latter are slightly better
sorted (Figs. 2, 3). Reefal sediments (TTB) are poorly sorted and show
increased mud contents (Fig. 2).
Reworked (i.e., fragmented/rounded) Amphistegina spp. (60–90%)
and other inner shelf taxa dominate the foraminiferal assemblages of
EXM B and D as well as unit B (Figs. 2, 3A). Sample TTB has a higher
diversity and is dominated by less or non-reworked individuals of
inner shelf taxa (Fig. 2), which are also present in lower abundance in
sections of unit B and samples EXM B and D. Fresh individuals of
Peneroplis pertusus are only found in unit B and TTB. While samples
EXM B and D are void of ostracods (Fig. 2), several adult specimens of
C. australiensis are present in unit B.

Mean grain size again increases until 2 cm b.s., before fining-up
from 2–0 cm b.s. A higher mud content is evident in the uppermost
6 cm (unit C), and a thin mud drape overlies the sand sequence.
4.2. Sediment fabric in μCT scans
Similar to unit B in C3, at least two subunits with a distinct
orientation of coarser shell and gravel components and graded bed-
ding are visible in the μCT scans of oriented core C37 (Figs. 1, 4).
However, in C37, subunit B-II is fining-up (Fig. 4C). For the base of
subunits B-I and B-II (OS1-3 in Fig. 4A,E), the longest axes of the
mainly prolate coarse particles (Fig. 5) exhibit a distinct shore-
parallel orientation (SW–NE to WSW–ENE) with a dominant dip of
~ 6–9° both towards SW and NE. Well-rounded, 15 cm-large Pleisto-
cene reef rock clasts floating in unit B were found in T20 (Fig. 8).
Micro-cavities (~ 0.5 cm) disrupt the sharp erosive boundary to
unit A, resembling flame structures (Fig. 4D).
Mud clasts floating in the sandy to gravelly matrix were identified in
subunit B-I (Figs. 4B, 8). The (palaeo-)surface of the underlying mud is
overlain by a ~1 cm-thick layer of medium to coarse sand with lower
amounts of shell fragments and gravel (Fig. 4D), analogous to the base
of unit B in C3 (base of subunit B-I; Fig. 2).
4.3. Transect-scale sediment characteristics and chronology
The sand sheet of unit B was detected in trenches (T) and further
cores (VC, C) along the entire transect, except for the most landward
core VC31 (Fig. 1). It thins and fines landwards and is partly cemented
in VC32–34 and T35. The basal ~1 cm-thick layer of medium to coarse
sand with reduced contents of larger mollusc fragments and gravel
(base of subunit B-I; Figs. 2, 4C–E) varies in thickness; it was not
found in the landward cores. While unit B is overlain by unit C in
the cores from the mudflat, it is followed by laminated sandy mud
(unit D, C27) and well-sorted fine sand (unit E, C25) landwards. In the
latter core, unit E gradually changes to muddy fine sand in its upper
part (50-0 cm b.s.). Landwards of VC32, the weathered Pleistocene
reef rock emerges at the surface; VC31 penetrated deeply weathered
cemented sand and red loam.
Based on the weighted mean of two OSL ages from T36 and T38
[4715 ± 453 years, 4997 ± 631 years], unit B was deposited 4833 ±
549 years ago (Tables 1, 2; Figs. 6, 7). This is in agreement with the
Fig. 5. Shape of the ellipsoids calculated from the orientations (longest axis) of the
particles separated for each subsample using the shape triangle diagram of Benn (1994).
Particle isotropy (I) and elongation (E) are calculated using the eigenvectors of the
ellipsoids, S1 (max eigenvalue), S2 (intermediate) and S3 (min); see Benn (1994) for
details. The eigenvalues have been calculated using Stereo32 software. All subsamples
exhibit a rather prolate shape, which supports the idea of a traction-based transportation
mode of the particles.

C-age of a bivalve shell from unit B in C3 (5582–5757 cal years BP) at
9 cm b.s. (Table 3), giving a maximum age for the sand sheet. Plant
remains from unit A yielded an age of 5922–6177 cal years BP at
46 cm b.s. The well-sorted fine sand of unit E in T38 (36 cm b.s.) gives
an age of 3773 ± 445 years.
5. Data interpretation and discussion
5.1. Sediment source and origin of unit B
While the foraminiferal assemblage of unit A, dominated by inner
shelf species A. longirostra, Q. seminula and Quinqueloculina sp., suggests
inter- to subtidal lagoonal conditions, juvenile C. australiensis (prefer-
ring sandy substrate), Paracytheroma sp. (preferring organic-rich
mud), Paracypris sp. and Xestoleberis sp. indicate a protected marginal-
marine palaeoenvironment with salinity fluctuations and temporarily
hypersaline conditions (e.g, Yassini and Jones, 1995), probably a semi-
enclosed lagoon (Table 4). These conditions persisted until ~ 6050 cal
BP or later.
The inverse grading in the basal (B-I, B-II) and normal grading in the
upper (B-I, B-III) part of its subunits (Figs. 1, 2), the distinct fining and
thinning landward pattern, and the erosive boundary to underlying
mudflat sediments point to an event-induced origin of unit B
(e.g., Morton et al., 2007). Although a suite of diagnostic characteristics
for the identification of palaeotsunami (and palaeostorm) deposits has
been discussed in the aftermath of the tsunamis in 2004 (Dec 26th,
Indian Ocean Tsunami), 2010 (Feb 27th, Chile Tsunami) and 2011
(Mar 11th, Tohoku-oki Tsunami, Japan) (e.g., Morton et al., 2007; Paris
et al., 2010; Szczuciński et al., 2012), the detection and differentiation
of storm and tsunami deposits are still associated with a number of
challenges, including site-specific sediment characteristics, an
archive-specific preservation potential, or post-depositional changes
(e.g., Szczuciński, 2012). However, tsunamis tend to generate extensive
sand sheets, generally fining inland and upwards, and comprising dis-
tinct subunits as well as an erosive lower contact. They often contain
rip-up clasts of reworked material, and sediment fabrics may reflect
palaeo-current directions (Paris et al., 2010). While storm deposits
may produce similar trench-scale sediment characteristics (Morton
et al., 2007), they generally tend to be more narrow and thick, and
thin landward rather abruptly on a transect scale (Paris et al., 2010).
All mentioned tsunami characteristics are found in unit B, the reason
why we tentatively conclude that it was deposited by a tsunami 5400–
4300 years ago. However, Supertyphoon Haiyan on the Philippines
recently demonstrated that powerful tropical cyclones may result in
coastal flooding with tsunami-similar hydrodynamic characteristics,
where infragravity waves with periods of N1 min are caused by non-
linear wave interactions with shallow reef platforms (May et al.,
2015b; Roeber and Bricker, 2015; Shimozono et al., 2015). In these
cases, pulses of sustained (i.e. N1 min) landward-directed coastal
flooding may reach flow velocities of N5 m/s, which is in the range of
those inferred for recent major tsunamis at the coast (Fritz et al., 2006,
2012). Since wave-reef interactions and the generation of infragravity
waves at our study site cannot be excluded, a storm generation of unit
B cannot entirely be ruled out.
The sediment source of the candidate tsunami deposit is predomi-
nantly the beach and dune directly NW of the transect based on unit
B's similarities in granulometry, microfaunal composition and taphono-
my (Figs. 2, 3), which reflects conditions at the sediment source and is
hardly modified by tsunami transport (Szczuciński et al., 2012). Well-
preserved individuals of Elphidium sp., Amphistegina sp. and Eponides

Some individuals of Pararotalia stellata as well as Quinqueloculina spp.
suggest the entrainment of material eroded from unit A.
5.2. Implications on hydrodynamic conditions and depositional processes
The orientation of particles deposited from suspension or traction
is preserved when current velocities are sufficiently high. A flow-
perpendicular orientation of the longest axes of (ellipsoidal) particles,
as observed in unit B (SW–NE to WSW–ENE, Fig. 4E), is typical for
bedload transport by rolling or sliding in strong and highly concentrated
currents (Wassmer et al., 2010; Schneider et al., 2014) and indicates
flow directions towards the SE. Inverse grading, observed at the base
of subunits B-I and B-II, is associated with traction carpets (trc) and
dominant bedload transport (tr; Figs. 2–4) also at the base of tsunami
deposits from the 2006 Java Tsunami and the 2011 Tohoku-oki Tsuna-
mi, where finer but dense sediment grains settle in a highly concentrat-
ed, collision-dominated flow (Moore et al., 2011; Szczuciński et al.,
2012). In addition, the flame structures between units A and B indicate
run-up-associated, synsedimentary deformation and truncation of basal
strata (i.e., unit A) (Matsumoto et al., 2008) due to high-velocity
unidirectional (landward) flow generating strong shear stress.
The poor sorting of basal layers can be attributed to the presence of a
coarser fraction (N700 μm), which causes the bimodal or close to
bimodal grain size distribution of, for example, the lower samples of
subunits B-I and B-II (Figs. 2, 3). The correlation between mean grain
size and sorting and the fining-upward trend may suggest a change in
deposition from bedload to suspension within a decelerating flow
particularly in subunits B-I and B-III (Moore et al., 2011) (Fig. 2).
While sediment particles in subunit B-II of C3 may have almost entirely
been deposited by traction, flow deceleration may be inferred at the top
of this subunit at C37 (Fig. 4C).
We tentatively interpret the deposit to represent three major waves
of one tsunami, with the base of subunits (Figs. 2, 4) representing initial
high-velocity inundation pulses. In addition, sediments at its base show
a trend towards better sorting between C27 and T35, before mud
contents within unit B cause very poor sorting in VC33. Decelerating
flow velocities during deposition of unit B and dominant deposition
from suspension are inferred for the landward section of the transect
(Moore et al., 2011).
5.3. Comparison with regional event data and RSL change
Previous studies found major far-field tsunamis of similar age from
geologic evidence in the northern Indian Ocean (e.g., Jackson et al.,
2014). However, the regional tsunami history and numerical models
suggest that the strongest events affecting Western Australia arise
from earthquakes along the Java and Sumbawa segments of the
Sunda megathrust (Burbidge et al., 2008). While a correlation of these
palaeoevents with the one presented here thus seems equivocal, it is re-
markable that age clusters of corals attached to wave-emplaced boul-
ders at the NW Cape and of shells found in dunes in SW Exmouth Gulf
(Scheffers et al., 2008, and references therein) coincide with the age of
unit B.

Ostracoda
Cyprideis australiensis (Hartmann, 1978) Similar to C. torosa and therefore assumed to tolerate similar ecological conditions. Widely distributed, indicator for
brackish environments with fluctuating salinities, saline lakes and coastal lagoons. Mostly found in northern, western and
southern Australia. A precondition for its settlement is relatively warm, shallow, brackish water. Tolerate wide range of
salinity from almost freshwater to fully marine and even hypersaline water in coastal ponds, lakes, lagoons, estuaries, fjords,
deltas, salt marshes and other marginal marine environments, down to a depth of 30 m (0.4–150‰). Also tolerates wide
range of temperature fluctuations and temporary freezing. Thrive in brackish water with solute compositions that prevent
colonisation by other Ostracoda species, including those that prefer high sulphate concentrations. Prefer mud or sandy mud
substrate, but also found on pure sand and algae (Yassini and Jones, 1995: 315; Reeves, 2004: 191; Abu-Zied et al., 2011:
177; Pint et al., 2012: 331).

Paracytheroma sp. (Juday, 1907) Marine. Typical inhabitant of coastal lagoons, where salinity fluctuation ranges from 5–47‰, the water temperature ranges
48 S.M. May et al. / Sedimentary Geology 332 (2016) 40–50
A RSL ~1 m higher than at present at the time of the tsunami and a
continuous RSL fall since then (Lewis et al., 2013) involved low sedi-
mentation rates during the mid- to late Holocene (Nott, 2004). While
the only thin sediment cover on top of unit B and the accumulation of
units C and D seem to reflect continuous deflation and episodic mud
flat deposition in the back-barrier area, the well-sorted sand of unit E
in the landward cores/trenches is of aeolian origin, with deposition
until at least 3773 ± 445 years ago (T38 OSL 1). Since then, soil forma-
tion took place, leading to or related to the evolution of carbonate crusts
in most of the landward cores.
6. Conclusions
Based on the analyses of μCT scans of oriented cores, multi-proxy
sediment and microfaunal analyses, this study presents the first strati-
graphic evidence of a prehistoric extreme-wave event, most likely a
palaeotsunami, from the NW part of Western Australia. The candidate
tsunami deposit was OSL-dated to 5400–4300 years ago.
Although rarely described from palaeotsunami deposits, the good
preservation of sedimentary characteristics and sediment fabric allow
for inferring hydrodynamic characteristics of the event. Up to three sub-
units were detected within the deposit, characterised by typical inverse
(bottom part) and normal (top part) grading. The qualitative and quan-
titative analysis of μCT scans, as exemplified in this study, represents a
novel approach to deduce sediment fabrics of palaeoevent deposits.
Particle orientations inferred from the μCT scans reveal that the subunits
were deposited due to landward flow directions during three run-up
phases of the event inducing high shear velocities at the beginning
and decelerating flow conditions at the end. Despite low sedimentation
rates during the last ~ 5000 years, our results show that geological
archives along the Ningaloo Reef are capable of remarkably well
preserving traces of extreme-wave events.
