Abstract
A probabilistic hazard analysis of tsunami generated by subaqueous volcanic explosion is applied to the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campania, Italy). An event tree is developed to quantify the tsunami hazard due to the submarine explosions by: i) defining potential size classes of explosion magnitude on the basis of past volcanic activity in the Campi Flegrei caldera and sites in the underwater part of the caldera; ii) simulating the generation and propagation of the consequent tsunami waves able to reach the coasts of the Campania region for all combinations of tsunami-generating vents and sizes; and iii) quantifying the tsunami probability and relative uncertainty, conditional upon the occurrence of an underwater eruption at Campi Flegrei. Tsunami hazard generated by subaqueous volcanic explosions is considered crucial because of its potential high impact on the densely populated coastal areas of the Pozzuoli Bay and Gulf of Naples even if the probability for eruptions in the submarine part of the caldera is certainly low. The tsunami hazard analysis is presented using conditional hazard curves and maps, that is calculating the probability (and relative uncertainties) of exceeding given tsunami intensity thresholds (wave amplitudes at the coast), given the occurrence of a subaqueous eruption. The results indicate that a significant tsunami hazard exists in many areas of the Bay of Naples.
Introduction
Tsunamis generated by eruptive and gravitational processes on the flanks of volcanic edifices are quite infrequent (about 5% of all recorded tsunamis: Latter, 1981), but they represent the third cause of fatalities due to volcanism, with four tsunamigenic eruptions being ranked in the twenty deadliest volcanic disasters (e.g. Auker et al., 2013). Tsunami hazards related to subaqueous eruptions are particularly challenging to evaluate and forecast, due to a lack of geological, observational and instrumental data, in particular in densely populated regions such as the Campi Flegrei caldera in Italy (Fig. 1).
Different tsunami source mechanisms can be involved during a subaqueous eruption: pyroclastic flows, debris flows, caldera collapses and explosions (Paris, 2015). Tsunami generation by subaqueous volcanic explosions is controlled by a range of physical parameters including water depth, size of eruptive vent, energy and depth of explosion, and complex magma-water interactions which determine the explosion itself (Le Méhauté, 1971; Kokelaar, 1986; Wohletz, 1986; Mirchina and Pelinovsky, 1988; Duffy, 1992; Le Méhauté and Wang, 1996; Kedrinskii, 2005; Egorov, 2007; Morrissey et al., 2010). The explosion forms an initial crater-like cavity at the water surface (Fig. 2a), with a cylindrical bore that expands radially to form the leading wave, followed by a wave trough. Initial surface displacement of the water surface (i.e. maximum height of the bore) can be empirically estimated directly as a function of explosion energy at a given water depth and size of the formed eruptive vent (Le Méhauté, 1971; Sato and Taniguchi, 1997; Goto et al., 2001). The initial downward displacement of the water column (i.e. the cavity) is followed by an upward displacement, thus forming a steep cone of water in the centre. This cone then collapses and turns to a second cylindrical bore, as demonstrated by experimental explosions and numerical simulations (e.g. Le Méhauté and Wang, 1996; Kedrinskii, 2005; Torsvik et al., 2010; Ulvrova et al., 2014, Ulvrova et al., 2016; Paris and Ulvrova, 2019).
Different methods of Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Analyses (PTHA) have been developed during the two last decades (Grezio et al., 2017). PTHA provides the likelihood of a given parameter of the tsunami (e.g. wave height at the coast, flow velocity, flow depth, runup height, or inundation distance) being exceeded at a particular location within a given period of time. PTHA can combine geological, historical and instrumental data both of tsunamis (e.g. sedimentary deposits, catalogues and historical accounts, tide-gauge records or pressure sensor time-series), and of tsunami sources (source parameters, such as fault and seismicity catalogue for earthquake sources), using statistical techniques and numerical simulations. Due to the low relative frequency of tsunamis, concurring with the lack of repeated tsunami run-up data spanning a long enough time period at a given location, the common practice is to propose numerous different tsunami source scenarios with their associated probability (Geist and Lynett, 2014). These scenarios are assumed to be a complete representation of the expected natural variability (Selva et al., 2016). However, PTHA methods for landslide and volcanic sources of tsunamis are far less established compared to the earthquake sources (Grezio et al., 2017). Here, we produce a first attempt of considering volcanic sources. We focus on conditional PTHA, that is, conditional upon the occurrence of a volcanic phenomenon potentially generating a tsunami (i.e. submarine eruptions). The quantification of long-term conditional hazard is common in volcanic hazard studies, since it allows for planning evacuation in case of eruption (e.g. update of the National Emergency Plan for Campi Flegrei, 2016: http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/en/media-communication/dossier/detail/-/asset_publisher/default/content/aggiornamento-del-piano-nazionale-di-emergenza-per-i-campi-flegrei
), as well as it provides reference simulations for short-term hazard quantifications (e.g., Selva et al., 2014). Its extension to absolute PTHA may be obtained by multiplying conditional hazard by the probability of occurrence of volcanic eruption. With >20 eruptions in the last 5 ka (e.g. 25 eruptions listed by Orsi et al., 2009), eruptions at Campi Flegrei have a mean annual rate on the order of 10−3 per year. However, we did not attempt here the estimation of any temporal component of the hazard, which is not trivial being volcanic eruptive sequences clearly not stationary in time (Bevilacqua et al., 2016).
In this study, we consider different scenarios of tsunamis generated by explosions in the offshore part of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campania, Italy) and their effects on the coasts of the Pozzuoli Bay, the islands of Ischia and Capri, and the Gulf of Naples (Fig. 1, Fig. 2a). These scenarios include different potential sizes and vent positions within the Campi Flegrei caldera. They are then combined according to their probability of occurrence, quantifying the consequent hazard in terms of conditional PTHA. The nested caldera of Campi Flegrei is a complex partly submerged volcanic structure created mainly by multiple caldera forming events: the 39 ka Campanian Ignimbrite, the 29 ka Masseria del Monte Tuff, and the 12 ka Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (e.g. Deino et al., 2004; Marti et al., 2016; Albert et al., 2019). During the last 12 ka, periods of high-frequency volcanism (mean intervals of 50–70 years) were separated by periods of quiescence lasting from 1 to 3.5 ka (Di Vito et al., 1999). While the onshore eruptive history of the caldera is well documented, past volcanic activity offshore and the probability for future eruptions in the submarine part of the caldera (Pozzuoli Bay) have been rarely discussed (Orsi et al., 2004; Tonini et al., 2015; Selva et al., 2012a). Seismic and magnetic surveys allowed the structural and magmatic evolution of the submerged southern half of the caldera to be reconstructed (Bruno, 2004; Aiello et al., 2012; Steinmann et al., 2018). The explosivity of coastal-to-submarine eruptions such as Nisida Bank (~10 ka), Nisida Island (~4 ka), and Capo Miseno (~3.7 ka) was recently reassessed to at least VEI 3 (Steinmann et al., 2018). Highly permeable ring-faults along the southern rim of the caldera are prone to magma ascent (Steinmann et al., 2018) and represent potential sites for future eruptions (Selva et al., 2012a). Moreover, structural and geophysical data indicate the presence of several major faults in the submerged part of the caldera, representing potential weakness areas in which eruption may be favoured (Selva et al., 2012a). Along these structures, the last eruption of Campi Flegrei (Monte Nuovo, 1538 CE) occurred starting at sea (Guidoboni and Ciuccarelli, 2011; Di Vito et al., 2016).

Methods
The methodology presented in this paper is based on the development of an event tree (Newhall and Hoblitt, 2002) for quantifying the tsunami hazard due to submarine explosions. This method is based on 3 major steps: (1) the event tree was set by identifying 17 potential vent areas in the underwater part of the Campi Flegrei caldera and 4 size classes of eruptive events (three of which tsunami-generating explosive eruptions), allowing the definition of 17 × 3 representative tsunami-generating
Tsunami wave heights at the coast
The three scenarios of explosions with vent radius, R, of 200, 650, and 900 m, correspond to explosion energies, E, of 2.9 × 1014, 9.8 × 1015, and 2.6 × 1016 J (Table 1). Following Eq. (3), these explosions create an initial surface displacement of the water surface, ƞ0, of 85, 200, and 250 m, respectively (Table 1). Tsunami waves generated by the explosion propagate radially away from the explosion centre, all over the computational area, with a significant influence of the bathymetry (e.g.
Discussion
Tsunami hazard related to subaqueous volcanic explosions in the study area, and particularly in the Pozzuoli Bay, is far from negligible, even if the probability for eruptions in the submarine part of the caldera is rather low. Considered largest scenarios of explosions (R = 900 m) generate waves higher than 10 m in the Pozzuoli Bay, but lower than 1.5 m in the Gulf of Naples. Wave refraction creates local amplification (e.g. eastern coast of Capri) that is well reproduced by the numerical
Conclusion
The conditional probabilistic hazard assessment for tsunamis generated by subaqueous volcanic explosions is presented for the Campi Flegrei caldera. The probability for eruptions in the submarine part of the caldera is rather low, but scenarios of tsunamis generated by subaqueous volcanic explosions and their potentially high impact in the Pozzuoli Bay and Gulf of Naples deserve to be considered due to high population density of these coastal areas. We demonstrated that tsunamis from volcanic
