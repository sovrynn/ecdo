Abstract. The modern avifauna of the Falkland Islands is well documented, but very little is known of the islands
before the first recorded human settlement in 1764. Since then, peat was cut and used widely as fuel throughout the
Falkland Islands until the late 20th century. From as early as the 1930s bones were noticed in peat deposits on West
Point Island and were briefly documented in 1950. This paper provides a more detailed analysis of more recent focussed
excavations of these subfossil remains. It summarises their known history and dates them at over 5000 years before
present. Eighteen avian species are identified and comparison is made with the extant bird fauna of the Falkland Islands
including the description of a new species of caracara (Aves: Falconidae: Phalcoboenus).

Introduction
The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) lie in the South Atlantic
between latitudes 51S and 53S and longitudes 57300W and
61300W, ~500 km north-east of the nearest point of South
America on Tierra del Fuego (Woods and Woods 2006). They
consist of two main islands, East and West Falkland, surrounded
by more than 700 smaller islands (Woods 2001). West Point
Island lies ~500 m off the north-western tip of West Falkland,
and it is here that the prehistoric bones described in this paper
were excavated (Figs 1, 2).
The island covers an area of ~1255 ha, with rugged cliffs up
to 370 m high principally on its western and southern coasts,
sloping gradually to sea level around much of the eastern coast.
Peat formed from low-growing woody shrubs and grasses is
widespread throughout the Falklands, with deposits up to 5 m
thick (Smith and Prince 1985; Woods 1988), and was cut as fuel
at all settlements on the Falkland Islands for at least a century.
A large peat bog lies ~1250 m west of the settlement on West
Point Island, from which a total depth of 2.7 m has been cut over
many years (R. B. Napier, pers. comm.). It is situated on a plateau
at an altitude of 67â€“76 m between Black Bog Hill and Rocky
Ridge Hill, both ~150 m high, and appears to be an example of
a raised ridge-top mire as described by Clark (1991). It is from
this peat bog that large numbers of bird bones have been
extracted (Adams and Woods 1997).
Residents of West Point Island have been aware of these
bones since discovering them in ~1934 whilst cutting peat for
fuel (K. Bertrand, pers. comm.). Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith
spent three weeks at West Point Island in early 1950, where he
collected a small number of bones from the peat bog; in a
resulting publication, Hattersley-Smith and Hamilton (1950),
stated that the deposit was discovered some 15 or 20 years earlier
and that the bones were plentiful. They deduced that as a result
of peat cutting the bone deposit was ~2.7 m below the original
peat surface, which they hypothesised, covered the site of a
former large freshwater pond. Today this remains the only
known avian bone deposit in the Falkland Islands.
In 1962 Roddy Napier, the owner of West Point Island,
showed the site to Robin W. Woods (RWW), who observed
large bones distributed in a depth of at least 30 cm. A selection
of these bones was collected, cleaned and sent to the US
National Museum, Washington, DC (specimen 557997).
Although we have not examined them directly, an image
appears to show bone elements from at least seven Striated
Caracara (Phalcoboenus australis) individuals that closely
resemble bones excavated by Mark P. Adams (MPA) and
RWW between 1996 and 2006.
In January 1971 the site was visited by Milton W. Weller
whilst investigating ponds of the Falkland Islands, who
concurred that the peat bog could have once been a ridge pond
and obtained dates for bones sent to him by R.B. Napier and others
of 2220  100 years (Weller 1975). However, carbon dating
samples analysed by Teledyne during the 1970s were measured
in â€˜gas proportional detectorsâ€™, and dating techniques have since
greatly improved (J. Buckley, Radiocarbon Laboratory, Teledyne
Brown Engineering, pers. comm.). The dating of more recently
excavated bones using â€˜accelerator datingâ€™ methods is discussed
in this paper.

On 1 January 1996, RWW and RB Napier visited the peat
bog specifically to locate the bone deposits; within minutes,
several whitened, dry and hard bone elements were found,
spread over the weathered and friable dried peat surface. Further
elements were located just below the surface in a small layer of
vegetable matter. It appeared that the bones in situ were present
only in an area a few metres square and any dry bones found over
the surrounding surface of the peat had been weathered out and
subsequently scattered.
In December 1996, ~200 bones were collected in four days
by MPA and RWW from this small area of the peat bog for
preservation, dating and identification. Another 300 or so bones

were collected during further excavations carried out from
December 1998 to November 2006. All elements excavated were
analysed and are presented here.
Caracaras
Caracaras form a subfamily (Falconinae, Tribe Polyborini) of
Falconidae and are found throughout South and Central
America and the southern USA (Fuchs et al. 2012). Of the 10
extant species known, only two currently breed in the Falkland
Islands: the Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus), the largest
extant species, and the slightly smaller Striated Caracara (Woods
and Woods 1997; Dickinson and Remsen 2013). A further
species, the much smaller Chimango Caracara (Phalcoboenus
chimango) occurs as a vagrant, recorded six times between the
1950s and 2012 (Woods 1988; Gregory 1994; Morrison 2013).
Caracaras are also known from the fossil record, including
four or five from the West Indies. These include Caracara
creightoni (Brodkorp 1959) from Cuba and the Bahamas,
Caracara latebrosus (Wetmore 1920) from cave deposits in
Puerto Rico and another possible species, as yet unpublished,
from Mona Island (between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola) (Olson
2008). These species were all about the size of the extant Crested
Caracara (Caracara cheriway). A larger species, similar in size
to Caracara plancus, is known from cave deposits on Grand
Cayman, and an even larger species, Caracara tellustris (Olson
2008), from Jamaica. Further species, again all in the genus
Caracara, have also been described more recently from mainland
South America: Caracara major (Jones et al. 2013), a very large
species from Uruguay; a possible further, even larger unnamed
species from Argentina (Jones et al. 2015); and Caracara
seymouri (SuÃ¡rez and Olson 2014), a smaller species from
Ecuador and Peru.
Among the bones from West Point Island are a few elements
that are very similar morphologically to P. australis and
C. plancus, but are much larger and not referable to any known
species. These are described as a new species in this paper.
Methods
Excavation procedure
The peat bog covers an area of ~1.35 ha. The majority of bones
excavated between 1996 and 2006 were in a small area no larger
than ~2 m2 and at depths no greater than 20 cm below the current
surface, but holes dug up to 20 m south of this main site, and at
depths of up to 108 cm, have also revealed bones. It is suspected
therefore that the bone deposit extends over an area of at least
100 m 2 at various depths beneath the undulating ground surface
of decomposed peat dust, over and through which Marram Grass
(Ammophila arenaria) and Sheepâ€™s Sorrel (Rumex acetosella) are
spreading northwards at a rate of ~1 m per year.
Bone elements were mostly found in isolation from others and
the location and position of bones was random, although a few
tibiotarsi with femurs, and mandibles with skulls, were still
associated. Slowly working across 1 m  1 m squares, the dense

Mid-Holocene Falkland Islands bird bones Emu C
peat was removed carefully by hand, using small trowels, small
scrapers and brushes.
The top centimetre or two of peat was characteristically
hard and dry due to direct exposure to weather, but below this
layer, peat was moist, soft and very dense. Bones tended to be
associated with a narrow layer of sand and a change in colour
and texture of the peat, suggesting some storm-driven sand
accumulations and perhaps some temporary change in the
vegetation.
The bones were relatively abundant here and, having been
preserved in this moist substrate, were often soft and fragile.
Removal of bones required slow and careful work and the
density of the surrounding peat meant that almost the entire
element had to be exposed before it could be successfully
excavated in one piece. Once exposed to the sun and air, the
bones rapidly dried and became extremely brittle. Excess peat
was removed from the bones, which were then wrapped in
moist tissue paper and sealed in plastic bags, except for four
large bones selected as duplicates for radio carbon analysis. In
this temporary stable condition, and under licences from the
Falkland Islands Government and Department for Environ-
ment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), all material was
transported to the UK for further cleaning, preservation and
examination.
Laboratory procedure
All specimens were transferred to the bird collections of the
Natural History Museum (NHMUK), Tring, UK. The bones were
further cleaned of peat and rehydrated where necessary with
distilled and deionised water. In order to preserve the still soft
elements in a stable condition, a dilute (10%) PVA glue solution
was applied by brush and pipette or by soaking. After being left
to air-dry at room temperature for 24â€“48 h, the bones were stable
enough to allow handling and detailed examination.
Identification of individual skeletal elements was carried
out by direct comparison against as many relevant modern speci-
mens as possible. Comparison with specimens held in the
extensive avian skeletal collection at the NHMUK yielded in
most cases sufficient evidence to permit identification to species
level. Where insufficient comparative specimens were available,
they were sourced from other museums. Elements were primarily
compared against modern specimens of species still extant in
the Falkland Islands, in addition to extant continental South
American species.
Material
Preservation of the bones is generally very good; most elements
are whole with little or no damage or signs of predation.
However, some fragile elements (skulls, sterna or synsacra) were
clearly damaged before collection and others during excavation
or preservation. Most are stained brown by the peat; those
from the surface show evidence of weathering and are paler
with usually more worn surfaces. All these bones appear full-
grown with little sign of â€˜immatureâ€™ individuals present.
A near-complete set of preserved bone elements of Striated
Caracara was returned to the Falkland Islands in 2002 for display
in the Stanley Museum. All other material is now held in the
bird collection of the NHMUK.
Dating of material
In order to date the bones accurately, four elements (a tibiotarsus
(weight 3.5 g), a carpometacarpus (1.0 g), an ulna (3.1 g) and
a vertebra (0.3 g)) were submitted for dating at the Radiocarbon
Accelerator Unit, Oxford University, UK. These elements were
collected in 1996 from different parts and depths of the exposed
peat, to allow sampling of bones of potentially varying ages. To
ensure dating was as accurate as possible, the selected elements
were untouched by hand, individually wrapped in aluminium foil
immediately after excavation from the peat and not subsequently
treated with any preservatives.
Bone elements of the new large caracara were compared
directly with modern skeletal material from the NHMUK, the
American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York and
the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution
(USNM). In order to carry out molecular analysis, a small section
of the holotype ulna was removed and analysed by Rob Fleischer
and Jon Beadell at the Genetics Program, USNM; unfortunately
DNA amplification proved unsuccessful.
Results
Radiocarbon dates of bones
Radiocarbon accelerator results were successfully obtained for all
four elements submitted. The age given is in radiocarbon years
Before Present (BP) equivalent to AD 1950: tibiotarsus, 5335 
50; carpometacarpus, 5250  50; ulna, 5255  45; vertebra,
5425  55.
The average age of the four elements is therefore 5316.25 
50 BP, with a maximum range of 280 years between 5200
and 5480 BP (D. C. Owen, Oxford University Radiocarbon
Accelerator Unit, pers. comm.).
Identification of bone elements
Of the bone elements, 495 have been positively identified
as avian. These range in size from pipits (Anthus) to geese
(Chloephaga) and include elements from nearly all parts of the
avian skeleton. A summary of the species and elements identified
is given in Table 1 (for detailed list of elements per species see
Table S1 in online supplementary material). For nomenclature
of anatomical structures, we follow Baumel (1993) and Tomek
and Bochenski (2009).
Unsurprisingly, no mammal bones were found, as there is no
evidence that the only native Falkland terrestrial mammal, the
Falkland Wolf or Warrah (Dusicyon antarcticus), extinct since
the mid-1870s, inhabited West Point Island (Slater et al. 2009).
New species of large caracara
Seven elements from West Point Island are larger and sufficiently
different from Striated Caracara to be described as a new species:

Date: Radiocarbon dates from four Striated Caracara elements
excavated from slightly varying depths and within the same 2 m 2
excavation site were all from the Holocene, ranging between
5250  50 and 5425  55 BP.

All collected Falkland Islands, West Point Island peat bog (as
Holotype above).
Diagnosis: All elements listed above resemble those of
Phalcoboenus, but are overall larger and more robust.
Description and comparison: Larger than any extant cara-
cara species. Morphology of all elements closely resemble those
of P. australis and C. plancus (both similar) though are larger
in all proportions. Elements can be attributed to the genus
Phalcoboenus by the following characters:
Ulna (Fig. 3), distal end: posterior margin of condylus
dorsalis joins gradually (sloped) with the shaft which is charac-
teristic of Phalcoboenus, rather than joining abruptly (at right
angles) as in Caracara. The crest of the tuberculum carpale is
angular and robust, again characteristic of Phalcoboenus, rather
than rounded and slighter as found in Caracara. Although the
ulna is incomplete (proximal third missing), the length from
the distal end to the â€˜nutrient foramenâ€™ shows it to be 36.3%
on average greater than P. australis and 38.8% greater than
C. plancus (Table 2.). With the relative position of the â€˜nutrient
foramenâ€™, known, the estimated total length of the ulna can also

be extrapolated as 161 mm, some 34.6% longer on average than
P. australis and 36.0% longer on average than C. plancus.
Furcula (Fig. 4), none of the three elements is complete.
However, the overall large size is evident and NHMUK S/
2002.52.4, though poorly preserved (possibly immature), shows
the caudally directed processus acromialis to be elongated similar
to that of P. australis and greater than that of C. plancus.
Mandible (Fig. 5), one left and one right articular end only
(possibly same individual). In dorsal view, crista transversa
fossae flatter and relatively broad as in P. australis rather than
more â€˜Uâ€™-shaped as in C. plancus. Articular cotyla also relatively
broad and parallel sided as in P. australis, not narrow and
â€˜pinchedâ€™ as in C. plancus.
Tarsometatarsus (Fig. 6), right tarsometatarsus, trochlea meta-
tarsi III and IV present only. With such limited material com-
parison is difficult, but the overall robustness is still evident and
similar to that found in P. australis rather than the more â€˜slightâ€™
C. plancus.
Unlike many Falconids, caracaras show very little reversed
sexual dimorphism in size. In fact the female is only 7% larger
than the male in both P. australis and C. plancus (Ferguson-Lees
and Christie 2001). The 36â€“38% larger size shown in the ulna

length of P. napieri would therefore discount sexual dimorphism
or individual variation as an explanation of the significantly
larger size.
The predominance of P. australis elements collected at the
same site and same depths as P. napieri show that the two
species must have co-existed. This would also eliminate the
hypothesis that P. australis on the Falkland Islands were
simply significantly larger c. 5000 years ago.
Discussion
Existence of bone deposit
Hattersley-Smith and Hamilton (1950) suggested that the peat
bog covers the site of a former large freshwater pond. Weller
(1975) concurred and suggested this could have been a ridge
pond. Charlie Porter of the Patagonia Research Foundation
(C. Porter, pers. comm.) suggested information on the potential
rate of peat accumulation. From his studies at Puerto Williams
on Isla Navarino in the Beagle Channel, he suggested that peat
in the islands off Tierra del Fuego has accumulated at ~1 m in
2000 years. Extrapolating to 5000 years (the approximate age
shown by Radiocarbon dating of the West Point Island deposit)
this suggests that ~2.5 m would accumulate in this period. This
is very similar to the apparent rate of accumulation shown on
West Point Island where it is understood ~2.7 m has been
removed through peat cutting.
The reasons for the presence of the large bone deposit within
the peat remain unclear. Hattersley-Smith and Hamilton (1950)
suggested that â€˜the fresh water proved attractive to the birdsâ€™ and
that â€˜the mud may have been of such a texture as to entrap the
unwaryâ€™ which could explain the relatively high proportion of
water birds in the deposit (five species of Anatidae and one
Scolopacidae). Nevertheless, although peat beds occur through-
out the Falkland Islands and peat has been cut for fuel since the
earliest recorded settlement by French colonists at Port Louis
in 1764, (Pernety 1771) the West Point Island peat bog bone
deposit is the only one so far discovered.
Species composition in deposit
The majority of species identified in the deposit are extant as
breeding birds in the Falkland Islands. The notable exceptions
are Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis), which occurs widely
across mainland South America, but is a rare vagrant to the
Falkland Islands, with only four records between 1993 and
2010, and the new caracara. The similarity between the species

Mid-Holocene Falkland Islands bird bones Emu G
found and the current avifauna suggests that, other than habitat
modification by man, the conditions in the Falklands around
5000 years ago were similar to those today.
Contrary to Hattersley-Smith and Hamiltonâ€™s (1950) state-
ment, no penguin bones were found nor bones of albatrosses or
the larger burrowing petrels, although their remains should
preserve well. Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melano-
phris), Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) and Magel-
lanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) breed in large numbers,
some within 750 m of the peat bog; the lack of these species may
relate to the fact that these birds select breeding sites on the
cliffs or shoreline and would rarely venture inland as far as the
peat bog site.
Possibly the most striking result from the bone assemblage
is the high proportion of Striated Caracara bones at over 49%,
representing a minimum of 16 individuals. This species is still
relatively abundant on West Point Island, with about 10 pairs
breeding and frequently a flock of ~100 immatures occurring
at the settlement during the autumn and winter. The Striated
Caracara is a powerful predator, scavenger and opportunist, is
gregarious, very inquisitive and will prey on any vulnerable
creature. If the developing peat bog was of a consistency to
â€˜entrapâ€™ unwary birds, this would certainly have attracted
Striated Caracara and other scavenging and predatory birds.
The elements collected may well give a biased picture of the
avifauna in the deposit. The majority of bones are relatively large
and robust and therefore potentially more likely to be preserved
and recovered, though some small elements, including those of
Correndera Pipit (Anthus correndera) and White-bridled Finch
(Melanodera melanodera), were collected.
Remarks
Despite the limited material recovered, we are confident in
placing this new species in the genus Phalcoboenus. This is
therefore the sixth species of this genus to be described and the
only species of the genus to be extinct. All previously described
species of caracara from the fossil record have been placed in
the genus Caracara. Like P. napieri, the majority of these
species have been discovered on â€˜islandsâ€™.
With very little skeletal material for comparison, other than
its large size it is difficult to speculate on the appearance and
behaviour of P. napieri. We can only suggest that like other
members of the genus, P. napieri was predominantly a scavenger
feeding mostly on the ground, and like P. australis in particular,
it may have been particularly reliant on the large seabird
(albatross, shag, penguin and prion) colonies around the coasts.
To date P. napieri elements have only been found on West
Point Island and it may be that this species was restricted to
islands that possessed sufficiently large seabird colonies to
sustain them. It may also have scavenged at seal colonies as
P. australis and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) do today.
The prehistoric habitat of West Point Island was probably
similar to that on present-day ungrazed islands such as Elephant
Jason that has rocky outcrops, severe cliffs and slopes carrying
heathland with substantial fringing cover of Tussock Grass (Poa
flabellata) or North Fur with cliffs and similar, more complete
tussock cover. Lower-lying islands, such as Flat Jason or Kidney
Island near Stanley, which are almost completely covered in
tussock, would provide cover and nesting sites as are used by
P. australis.
Acknowledgements
We are very grateful to Roddy and Lily Napier for allowing us to stay on
West Point Island for varying lengths of time between 1996 and 2006 and for
their permission to excavate part of their peat bog and to remove sub-fossil
bones for research. We thank Nick Woods for dedicated help with excavation
in 1996 and 1999, while Alastair Pinkerton and Alan Murray helped with
the exploratory digs in later visits. We are grateful to Adrian Doyle, formerly
of the Palaeontology Conservation Unit at the Natural History Museum,
London for advice on bone preservation techniques and we thank Harry
Taylor for taking specimen photographs. We thank Julian Hume for measur-
ing caracara specimens held in the collections of the United States National
Museum and American Museum of Natural History. Access to this material
was kindly given by Storrs Olson and Paul Sweet respectively. We also
thank Robert Prys-Jones and Julian Hume for reading and commenting on
an early draft of this paper and Rob Still of Princeton WILDGuides for
producing maps.
