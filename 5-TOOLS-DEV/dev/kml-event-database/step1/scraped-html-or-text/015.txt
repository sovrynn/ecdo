Abstract and Figures
Gerard C. Bond established a Holocene series of North Atlantic ice-rafted debris events based on quartz and haematite-stained grains recovered from subpolar North Atlantic marine cores. These so-called “Bond events” document nine large-scale and multi-centennial North Atlantic cooling phases that might be linked to a reduced thermohaline circulation. Regardless of the high prominence of the Holocene North Atlantic ice-rafted debris record, there are critical scientific comments on the study: the Holocene Bond curve has not yet been replicated in other marine archives of the North Atlantic and there exist only very few palaeoclimatic studies that indicate all individual Bond events in their own record. Therefore, evidence of consistent hydro-climatic teleconnections between the subpolar North Atlantic and distant regions is not clear. In this context, the Western Mediterranean region presents key hydro-climatic sites for the reconstruction of a teleconnection with the subpolar North Atlantic. In particular, variability in Western Mediterranean winter precipitation might be the result of atmosphere–ocean coupled processes in the outer-tropical North Atlantic realm. Based on an improved Holocene δ18O record from Lake Sidi Ali (Middle Atlas, Morocco), we correlate Western Mediterranean precipitation anomalies with North Atlantic Bond events to identify a probable teleconnection between Western Mediterranean winter rains and subpolar North Atlantic cooling phases. Our data show a noticeable similarity between Western Mediterranean winter rain minima and Bond events during the Early Holocene and an opposite pattern during the Late Holocene. There is evidence of an enduring hydro-climatic change in the overall Atlantic atmosphere–ocean system and the response to external forcing during the Middle Holocene. Regarding a potential climatic anomaly around 4.2 ka (Bond event 3) in the Western Mediterranean, a centennial-scale winter rain maximum is generally in-phase with the overall pattern of alternating “wet and cool” and “dry and warm” intervals during the last 5000 years.

Abstract. Gerard C. Bond established a Holocene series of
North Atlantic ice-rafted debris events based on quartz and
haematite-stained grains recovered from subpolar North At-
lantic marine cores. These so-called “Bond events” docu-
ment nine large-scale and multi-centennial North Atlantic
cooling phases that might be linked to a reduced thermoha-
line circulation. Regardless of the high prominence of the
Holocene North Atlantic ice-rafted debris record, there are
critical scientiﬁc comments on the study: the Holocene Bond
curve has not yet been replicated in other marine archives of
the North Atlantic and there exist only very few palaeocli-
matic studies that indicate all individual Bond events in their
own record. Therefore, evidence of consistent hydro-climatic
teleconnections between the subpolar North Atlantic and dis-
tant regions is not clear. In this context, the Western Mediter-
ranean region presents key hydro-climatic sites for the re-
construction of a teleconnection with the subpolar North
Atlantic. In particular, variability in Western Mediterranean
winter precipitation might be the result of atmosphere–ocean
coupled processes in the outer-tropical North Atlantic realm.
Based on an improved Holocene δ18O record from Lake
Sidi Ali (Middle Atlas, Morocco), we correlate Western
Mediterranean precipitation anomalies with North Atlantic
Bond events to identify a probable teleconnection between
Western Mediterranean winter rains and subpolar North At-
lantic cooling phases. Our data show a noticeable simi-
larity between Western Mediterranean winter rain minima
and Bond events during the Early Holocene and an oppo-
site pattern during the Late Holocene. There is evidence of
an enduring hydro-climatic change in the overall Atlantic
atmosphere–ocean system and the response to external forc-
ing during the Middle Holocene. Regarding a potential cli-
matic anomaly around 4.2 ka (Bond event 3) in the West-
ern Mediterranean, a centennial-scale winter rain maximum
is generally in-phase with the overall pattern of alternating
“wet and cool” and “dry and warm” intervals during the last
5000 years.
1 Introduction
Gerard C. Bond reconstructed a Holocene series of North
Atlantic ice-rafting events (Bond et al., 1997, 2001) based
on the numbers of counted quartz and haematite-stained
grains in marine cores recovered from the subpolar North
Atlantic (Fig. 1a). These so-called “Bond events” doc-
ument nine (Fig. 3b) large-scale and multi-centennial
North Atlantic cooling phases that might be linked to a
reduced thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic.
Due to attested large-scale atmosphere–ocean-linked tele-
connections, an increasing number of palaeoclimatologists
relate Bond events with chronologically in-phase cli-
matic anomalies all over the world. To this day, the paper
about North Atlantic ice-rafted debris events (Bond et al.,

... At the onset of the Holocene, northern Morocco shared the same climatic conditions as southern Europe, characterized by abundant winter precipitation (Ait Brahim et al., 2019;Wassenburg et al., 2016;Zielhofer et al., 2017a,b). This increase is clearly linked to the onset of the African Humid Period (AHP) and last green Sahara conditions (Cheddadi et al., 2021;Depreux et al., 2021;Tierney et al., 2017;Zielhofer et al., 2019), reaching a rainfall maxima between 9.6 and 7 cal kaBP. The resultant forest growth (Damnati and Reddad, 2017;Rhoujjati et al., 2010) stabilized hillslopes and reduced sediment supply to the main channel, which became less active and primarily incised. ...
... In northeastern Morocco, two separate alluviation events were recorded during 10-8 cal kaBP: one around 10 cal kaBP in the Lower Moulouya area , and another between 8 and 8.2 cal kaBP in the Moulouya catchment highlands (Depreux et al., 2022). Both events coincided with rapid aridification across the Mediterranean region.Using Lake Sidi Ali records within the Middle Atlas domain, Zielhofer et al. (2019Zielhofer et al. ( , 2017a revealed sub-millennial to centennial-scale lake-lowering events coeval with decreases in Western Mediterranean winter precipitation and pronounced southern dust provenance recorded at Sidi Ali at around 10.3/10.2, 9.2/9.4, ...
... This variability may also be linked to solar activity, as sub-centennial minima correlate with peaks in fluvial activity in Morocco and Tunisia McGregor et al., 2009), such as the Wolf (~0.65 cal kaBP/1300 AD), Spörer (~0.5 cal kaBP/1450 AD), Maunder (~0.28 cal kaBP/1675 AD), and Dalton (~0.13 cal kaBP/1825 AD) minima (see Fig. 5I in Fletcher and Zielhofer, 2013). Applying a 1000-year low-pass filter, the deposition of Unit 6 in the Inaouène coincides with conditions of dry winters and cool summers (Campbell et al., 2017;Zielhofer et al., 2019), enhanced erosion (Lamb et al., 1999), and a Rainfall Index oscillating around 0, indicating precipitation similar to present-day conditions in the Middle Atlas. Collectively, these parameters seem to be associated with the last interval of North Atlantic cooling (i.e., event 0). ...

... Cryospheric activity is largely inferred from variable alternative approaches, including ice-rafted debris and their geochemistry (e.g. Bennett et al., 1996;Eyles, 2008;Bennett and Glasser, 2009;Girard et al., 2015;Le Heron, 2015;Tripati and Darby, 2018;Zielhofer et al., 2019;Rodríguez-López et al., 2021), cold water-related authigenic minerals (i.e., glendonite after ikaite, Tang et al., 2009;Suan et al., 2010;Last and Last, 2012;Zhou et al., 2015;Vickers et al., 2018Vickers et al., , 2019Mikhailova et al., 2021), oxygen isotope records (e.g., Zachos et al., 2001Zachos et al., , 2008Tripati et al., 2005), and distribution of microfossils that adapt in or close to sea ice (Stickley et al., 2012). ...
... The occurrence of IRD-rich intervals has been widely linked to brief seasonal cold snaps that were followed shortly thereafter by a significant thawing of ice shelf-bearing dropstones in response to an abrupt temperature rise (Bennett et al., 1996;Le Heron, 2015;Tripati and Darby, 2018;Zielhofer et al., 2019;Rodríguez-López et al., 2021). Integrating the former paleogeomorphic scenario with the stratigraphically reported ice crystal marks, IRD, and glendonite clusters along with other IISS recorded in the Niubao Formation, we thus suggest that the ancient lake of the Lunpola Basin was possibly subjected to brief cold snaps or near-freezing settings, which was interrupted by a seasonally warm surface lake during the summer (Fig. 12). ...

... Although less studied compared to other karstic systems of the Western Mediterranean region (particularly the Iberian Range), the Middle Atlas (Northern Morocco) is home to thick and extensive Quaternary tufa deposits, thanks to widespread Liassic carbonate rocks and active karstification (Tennevin, 1978;Martin, 1981;Baali and Fedan, 1996;Gourari, 2001). However, only a few contributions to our understanding of past regional climate variability come from tufa records (Wackenheim et al., 2020;Dabkowski et al., 2022;Azennoud et al., 2022a), and most paleo-reconstructions are based on speleothems (Wassenburg et al., 2013(Wassenburg et al., , 2016Ait Brahim et al., 2017, 2019a, 2019bSha et al., 2021Sha et al., , 2019 and lake sediments (Lamb et al., 1989(Lamb et al., , 1999Cheddadi et al., 2009;Rhoujjati et al., 2010;Nourelbait et al., 2014Nourelbait et al., , 2016Campbell et al., 2017;Zielhofer et al., 2017Zielhofer et al., , 2019Abdellah et al., 2021;Azennoud et al., 2023).

The climate records from the Bosten lake in China showed almost similar reconstruction as the present study, i.e. drier climate at 3900-3600, 3400-3200, 2600-2500, 1900-1100, and 500-300 Cal years BP (Wü Nnemann et al., 2006). The δ 18 O records from the Sidi Ali Lake in Morocco also showed peaks at 3300, 2700, 2100 Cal years BP and Little Ice Age, signifying dry phases, which corresponded to low NAO stages (Olsen et al., 2012;Zielhofer et al., 2019). The δ 18 O of Globigerinoides ruber from the eastern Mediterranean Sea showed humid phases during 3500-3000, 1700-1000 and 270 Cal years BP with relatively arid conditions during 3000-1700 and 800 Cal years BP (Schilman et al., 2001). ...
