Everything is unique (only one file), except for the fossils:

1. exclusively-marine-1000: Exclusively marine, all collections.
2. exclusively-marine-geosummary-1000: Exclusively marine collections, clustered into geosummary groups. Lower granularity but easier on the computer.
3. unique-marine-collection-coords-1000: All marine (including ones that can also be freshwater), all collections.
4. unique-marine-geosummary-10k-coords: Above but clustered into geosummary groups.

Just load them up into Google Earth (Pro). Happy viewing!

# TODOs

Add the actual textual flood story to the flood myth markers as a description

Plot archaeological sites

Could map all coal/oil/gas deposits rather than just extraction sites (couldn't find good data)

I'm sure there's plenty more that can be plotted to understand the flip better.
