              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Tengys (Sea) was once lord over the earth. Nama, a good
man, lived during his rule with three sons, Sozun-uul,
Sar-uul, and Balyks. Ülgen commanded Nama to build an
ark (<i>kerep</i>), but Nama's sight was failing, so he
left the building to his sons. The ark was built on a
mountain, and from it were hung eight 80-fathom cables with
which to gauge water depth. Nama entered the ark with his
family and the various animals and birds which had been
driven there by the rising waters. Seven days later, the
cables gave way from the earth, showing that the flood had
risen 80 fathoms. Seven days later, Nama told his eldest
son to open the window and look around, and the son saw
only the summits of mountains. His father ordered him to
look again later, and he saw only water and sky. At last
the ark stopped in a group of eight mountains. On
successive days, Nama released a raven, a crow, and a rook,
none of which returned. On the fourth day, he sent out a
dove, which returned with a birch twig and told why the
other birds hadn't returned; they had found carcasses of a
deer, dog, and horse respectively, and had stayed to feed
on them. In anger, Nama cursed them to behave thus to the
end of the world. When Nama became very old, his wife
exhorted him to kill all the men and animals he had saved
so that they, transferred to the other world, would be
under his power. Nama didn't know what to do. Sozun-uul,
who didn't dare to oppose his mother openly, told his
father a story about seeing a blue-black cow devouring a
human so only the legs were visible. Nama understood the
fable and cleft his wife in two with his sword. Finally,
Nama went to heaven, taking with him Sozun-uul and changing
him into a constellation of five stars. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, pp. 364-365]</p></p>

              <p><p>Hailibu, a kind and generous hunter, saved a white snake
from a crane which attacked it. Next day, he met the same
snake with a retinue of other snakes. The snake told him
that she was the Dragon King's daughter, and the Dragon
King wished to reward him. She advised Hailibu to ask for
the precious stone that the Dragon King keeps in his mouth.
With that stone, she told him, he could understand the
language of animals, but he would turn to stone if he ever
divulged its secret to anyone else. Hailibu went to the
Dragon King, turned down his many other treasures, and was
given the stone. Years later, Hailibu heard some birds
saying that the next day the mountains would erupt and
flood the land. He went back home to warn his neighbors,
but they didn't believe him. To convince them, he told them
how he had learned of the coming flood and told them the
full story of the precious stone. When he finished his
story, he turned to stone. The villagers, seeing this
happen, fled. It rained all the next night, and the
mountains erupted, belching forth a great flood of water.
When the people returned, they found the stone which
Hailibu had turned into and placed it at the top of the
mountain. For generations, they have offered sacrifices to
the stone in honor of Hailibu's sacrifice. [<a href="#Elder">Elder &amp; Wong</a>, pp. 75-77]</p></p>

              <p>Naubandhana</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Manu, the first human, found a small fish in his
washwater. The fish begged protection from the larger
fishes, in return for which it would save Manu. Manu kept
the fish safe, transferring it to larger and larger
reservoirs as it grew, eventually taking it to the ocean.
The fish warned Manu of a coming deluge and told him to
build a ship. When the flood rose, the fish came, and Manu
tied the craft to its horn. The fish led him to a northern
mountain and told Manu to tie the ship's rope to a tree to
prevent it from drifting. Manu, alone of all creatures,
survived. He made offerings of clarified butter, sour milk,
whey, and curds. From these, a woman arose, calling herself
Manu's daughter. Whatever blessings he invoked through her
were granted him. Through her, he generated this race. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 94-95; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 128; <a href="#Brinton">Brinton</a>, pp. 227-228]</p>
<p>The great sage Manu, son of Vivasvat, practiced austere
fervor. He stood on one leg with upraised arm, looking down
unblinkingly, for 10,000 years. While so engaged on the
banks of the Chirini, a fish came to him and asked to be
saved from larger fish. Manu took the fish to a jar and, as
the fish grew, from thence to a large pond, then to the
river Ganga, then to the ocean. Though large, the fish was
pleasant and easy to carry. Upon being released into the
ocean, the fish told Manu that soon all terrestrial objects
would be dissolved in the time of the purification. It told
him to build a strong ship with a cable attached and to
embark with the seven sages (<i>rishis</i>) and certain
seeds, and to then watch for the fish, since the waters
could not be crossed without it. Manu embarked as enjoined
and thought on the fish. The fish, knowing his desire,
came, and Manu fastened the ship's cable to its horn. The
fish dragged the ship through roiling waters for many
years, at last bringing it to the highest peak of Himavat,
which is still known as Naubandhana ("the Binding of the
Ship"). The fish then revealed itself as Parjapati Brahma
and said Manu shall create all living things and all things
moving and fixed. Manu performed a great act of austere
fervor to clear his uncertainty and then began calling
things into existence. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
185-187]</p>
<p>The heroic king Manu, son of the Sun, practiced austere
fervor in Malaya and attained transcendent union with the
Deity. After a million years, Brahma bestowed on Manu a
boon and asked him to choose it. Manu asked for the power
to preserve all existing things upon the dissolution of the
universe. Later, while offering oblations in his hermitage,
a carp fell in his hands, which Manu preserved. The fish
grew and cried to Manu to preserve it, and Manu moved it to
progressively larger vessels, eventually moving it to the
river Ganga and then to the ocean. When it filled the
ocean, Manu recognized it as the god Janardana, or Brahma.
It told Manu that the end of the <i>yuga</i> was
approaching, and soon all would be covered with water. He
was to preserve all creatures and plants aboard a ship
which had been prepared. It said that a hundred years of
drought and famine would begin this day, which would be
followed by fires from the sun and from underground that
would consume the earth and the ether, destroying this
world, the gods, and the planets. Seven clouds from the
steam of the fire will inundate the earth, and the three
worlds will be reduced to one ocean. Manu's ship alone will
remain, fastened by a rope to the great fish's horn. Having
announced all this, the great being vanished. The deluge
occurred as stated; Janardana appeared in the form of a
horned fish, and the serpent Ananta came in the form of a
rope. Manu, by contemplation, drew all creatures towards
him and stowed them in the ship and, after making obeisance
to Janardana, attached the ship to the fish's horn with the
serpent-rope. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
188-190]</p>
<p>At the end of the past <i>kalpa</i>, the demon Hayagriva
stole the sacred books from Brahma, and the whole human
race became corrupt except the seven Nishis, and especially
Satyavrata, the prince of a maritime region. One day when
he was bathing in a river, he was visited by a fish which
craved protection and which he transferred to successively
larger vessels as it grew. At last Satyavrata recognized it
as the god Vishnu, "The Lord of the Universe." Vishnu told
him that in seven days all the corrupt creatures will be
destroyed by a deluge, but Satyavrata would be saved in a
large vessel. He was told to take aboard the miraculous
vessel all kinds of medicinal herbs, food esculant grains,
the seven Nishis and their wives, and pairs of brute
animals. After seven days, the oceans began to overflow the
coasts and constant rain began flooding the earth. A large
vessel floated in on the rising waters, and Satyavrata and
the Nishis entered with their wives and cargo. During the
deluge, Vishnu preserved the ark by again taking the form
of a giant fish and tying the ark to himself with a huge
sea serpent. When the waters subsided, he slew the demon
who had stolen the holy books and communicated their
contents to Satyavrata. [<a href="#HMiller">H. Miller</a>,

<p>One windy day, the sea flooded the port city of
Dwaravati. All its occupants perished except Krishna, an
avatar of Vishnu, and his brother Balarama, who were
walking in the forests of Raivataka Hill. Krishna left his
brother alone. Sesha, the serpent who supports the world,
withdrew his energy from Balarama; in a jet of light,
Balarama's spirit entered the sea, and his body fell over.
Krishna decided that tomorrow he would destroy the world
for all its evils, and he went to sleep. Jara the hunter
passed by, mistook Krishna's foot for the face of a stag,
and shot it. The wound to Krishna's foot was slight, but
Jara found Krishna dead. He had saffron robes, four arms,
and a jewel on his breast. The waters still rose and soon
lapped at Jara's feet. Jara felt ashamed but helpless; he
left deciding never to speak of the incident. [<a href="#Buck">Buck</a>, pp. 408-409]</p></p>

But as they emerged from the cave, they were terrified by
the sight of the tigers. They prayed to the Creator for
strength and killed the beasts. After that, they lived
happily and repopulated the world. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 97]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>After death came into the world as a result of a
macaque's curse, sky and earth longed for human souls and
bones. That is how the flood began. An orphaned brother and
sister lived in squalor in a village. A pair of golden
birds flew down to them one day, warned them that a huge
wave would flood the earth, and told them to take shelter
in a gourd and not to come out until they heard the birds
again. The two children warned their neighbors, but the
people didn't believe them. The children sawed off the top
of a gourd and went inside. For ninety-nine days, there was
no wind or rain, and the earth became parched. Then
torrents of rain fell, and the resulting flood washed
everything away. The brother and sister occasionally could
hear the gourd bump against the bottom of heaven. After
long waiting, they heard the birds calling, left the gourd,
and found they had landed atop a mountain, and the flood
had receded. But now there were nine suns and seven moons
in the sky, and they scorched the earth during the day. The
two golden birds returned with a golden hammer and silver
tongs and instructed the children how to use them to get
the dragon king's bow and arrows. Brother and sister went
to the dragon pond and struck the reef-home of the dragon
king with the hammer. This raised such a racket that the
dragon king sent his servants (various fish) to
investigate. The children grabbed the fish with the tongs
and threw them on the bank. At last, the dragon king
himself came to investigate and had to give his bow and
arrows when he was likewise caught. With these, brother and
sister shot down all but the brightest sun and moon.
Brother and sister then went in search of other people,
exploring north and south respectively. They found nobody
else, and the golden birds appeared again and urged them to
marry. They refused, but the birds told them it was the
will of heaven. After divinations in the form of several
improbable events (tortoise shells landing a certain way, a
broken millstone came together, and the brother shooting an
arrow through a needle's eye--all happening three times),
they consented. They had six sons and six daughters which
traveled different directions and became the ancestors of
different races. [<a href="#Miller">L. Miller</a>, pp.

              <p><p>The Supreme Sovereign ordered the water god Gong Gong to
create a flood as punishment and warning for human
misbehavior. Gong Gong extended the flood for 22 years, and
people had to live in high mountain caves and in trees,
fighting with wild animals for scarce resources. Unable to
persuade the Supreme Sovereign to stop the flood, and told
by an owl and a turkey about _Xirang_ or Growing Soil, the
supernatural hero Gun stole Growing Soil from heaven to dam
the waters. Before Gun was finished, however, the Supreme
Sovereign sent the fire god Zhu Rong to execute him for his
theft. The Growing Soil was taken back to heaven, and the
floods continued. However, Gun's body didn't decay, and
when it was cut apart three years later, his son Yu emerged
in the form of a horned dragon. Gun's body also transformed
into a dragon at that time and thenceforth lived quietly in
the deeps. The Supreme Sovereign was fearful of Yu's power,
so he cooperated and gave Yu the Growing Soil and the use
of the dragon Ying. Yu led other gods to drive away Gong
Gong, distributed the Growing Soil to remove most of the
flood, and led the people to fashion rivers from Ying's
tracks and thus channel the remaining floodwaters to the
sea. [<a href="#Walls">Walls</a>, pp. 94-100]</p>
<p>The goddess Nu Kua fought and defeated the chief of a
neighboring tribe, driving him up a mountain. The chief,
chagrined at being defeated by a woman, beat his head
against the Heavenly Bamboo with the aim of wreaking
vengeance on his enemies and killing himself. He knocked it
down, tearing a hole in the sky. Floods poured out,
inundating the world and killing everyone but Nu Kua and

              <p>summit of a mountain</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>A son was borne to a fairy and a laurel tree; the fairy
returned to heaven when the boy was seven years old. One
day, rains came and lasted for many months, flooding the
earth with a raging sea. The laurel, in danger of falling,
told his son to ride him when it came uprooted by the
waves. The boy did so, floating on the tree for many days.
One day a crowd of ants floated by and cried out to be
saved. After asking the tree for permission, the boy gave
them refuge on the branches of the laurel. Later, a group
of mosquitoes flew by and also asked to be saved. Again,
the boy asked the tree for permission, was granted it, and
gave the mosquitoes rest. Then another boy floated by and
asked to be saved. This time the tree refused permission
when its son asked. The son asked twice more, and after the
third time the tree said, "Do what you like," and the son
rescued the other boy. At last the tree came to rest on the
summit of a mountain. The insects expressed their gratitude
and left. The two boys, being very hungry, went and found a
house where an old woman lived with her own daughter and a
foster-daughter. As everyone else in the world had perished
and the subsiding waters allowed farming again, the woman
decided to marry her daughters to the boys, her own going
to the cleverer boy. The second boy maliciously told the
woman that the other boy could quickly gather millet grains
scattered on sand. The woman tested this claim, and the
first boy despaired of ever succeeding, when the ants came
to his aid, filling the grain bag in a few minutes. The
other boy had watched, and he told the woman that the task
hadn't been done by the first boy himself, so the woman
still couldn't decide which daughter to marry to which boy.
She decided to let the boys decide by chance, going to one
room or another in total darkness. A mosquito came and told
the Son of the Tree which room the old woman's daughter was
in, so those two were married, and the second boy married
the foster-daughter. The human race is descended from those
two couples. [<a href="#Zong">Zong</a>, pp. 16-18]</p>
<p>Young Gim's father was killed by robbers, and Gim set
out to track them and get revenge. On the way, he met
another bereaved boy hunting the same robbers. They became
sworn brothers, but they were separated when a storm upset
their ferry as they were crossing a river. Gim was rescued
by another boy who had been orphaned by the same robbers.
They too swore to be brothers but were separated when their
ferry sank in a storm. Gim was rescued and hidden by an old
woman; he was on the island of the robbers but was helpless
from his injuries. One day a mysterious man came by and
asked Gim to go with him. Gim lived with the man in the
mountains studying magic until he was sixteen, whereupon
the man told him to go and rescue the king from the
robbers, and that he would meet Gim again in three years
exactly. Gim set out, finding a magic horse, arms, and
armor along the way, and arrived at the king's castle when
it was on the point of surrender. In the enemy camp, he
found a black face belching fire at the castle, a genii
studying astrology, a rat whose swinging tail produced a
flood which threatened the castle, and a giant who hurled
flames at the King's camp. Gim fought them with his magic
but was overwhelmed by their numbers. He fled with the king
to an island, but the rat tried to submerge it with an even
greater flood from its tail. A butterfly led Gim to a
cavern in a distant mountain, where he met the first boy he
had encountered. They went back to fight together, but the
other boy was killed and the island submerged, and Gim and
the King retreated to a second island. Gim was led by a
crow to another cavern in the mountains where he met his
other friend. They returned to fight, but again the friend
was killed, the island submerged, and Gim and the King had
to retreat. When a third island was threatened with the
flood, they took refuge on a ship. Gim's mentor then came
(three years having elapsed) and with his magic called down
thunderbolts which destroyed all of the enemy. Gim went to
the enemy island, found his mother, and married the sister
of his second friend. [<a href="#Zong">Zong</a>, pp.

<p>The River Dedong flooded the countryside. An old man in
Pyongyang, rowing about in a boat, found and rescued a
deer, a snake, and a boy from the waters. He carried them
to shore and released them, but the boy had lost his
parents in the flood and so became the man's adopted son.
One day the deer came and led the man to a buried treasure
of gold and silver, and the man became rich. The foster-son
became reckless with the money, and he and his father
argued. The boy accused the man of theft, and the man was
imprisoned. The snake came to him in his cell and bit his
arm, which then swelled painfully. But then the snake
returned with a small bottle. The man applied the medicine
to his arm, which cured it at once. In the morning, he
heard that the magistrate's wife was dying of a snakebite,
so he sent word that he could cure her. This he did with
the snake's ointment. He was released, and the foster-son
was arrested and punished. [<a href="#Zong">Zong</a>, pp.

<p>A foundling infant grew up incredibly fast and soon
showed signs of fantastic strength. He earned the name
"Iron-shoes" from the footwear he needed. He set out on a
journey and met with and joined three other extraordinary
men--"Nose-wind", who had extraordinarily powerful breath;
"Long-rake", who crumbled mountains with his rake, and
"Waterfall", who made rivers by pissing. They went to an
old woman's home and were invited to spend the night, but
the woman locked them in, and the men realized that she and
her four sons were tigers in disguise. The tigers tried to
kill them by roasting the room, but Nose-wind kept it cool
by his blowing. The next day, the woman challenged them to
a contest of gathering pine trees while her sons stacked
them. When it became clear that the four brothers ripped up
the trees faster than the tigers could stack them, the
woman set fire to the logs. Waterfall, though, made water
which not only put out the fire, but created a flood that
nearly drowned the tigers. Nose-wind blew on the water and
froze it. Iron-shoes skated out and kicked the heads off
the tigers, and Long-rake broke up the ice and threw it far
and wide, eliminating any trace of the flood. [<a href="#Zong">Zong</a>, pp. 162-166]</p></p>

They took refuge in a stone cave and emerged unharmed when
the flood was over. Jaher-era asked them where they had

<p>When social distinctions were assigned to the various
tribes, the Marndis were overlooked. Ambir Singh and Bir
Singh, two members of that tribe from Mount Here, were
incensed at this slight, and they prayed for fire from
heaven to destroy the other tribes. Fire fell and
devastated the country, destroying half the population. The
home of Ambir Singh and Bir Singh was stone, so they
escaped unhurt. Kisku Raj heard what had happened and was
told that Ambir Singh and Bir Singh were responsible. He
ordered them to explain themselves, and they told of their
being overlooked in the distribution of distinctions. Kisku
Raj told them not to act thus, and they would receive an
office. They stopped the fire-rain, and the Marndi were
appointed stewards over the property of kings and nobles
and over all rice. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.

great that the creator Thakur Jiu sent a fire-rain to

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Some time after their creation, men grew disobedient. In
anger, Puluga, the Creator, sent a flood which covered the
whole land, except perhaps Saddle Peak where Puluga himself
resided. Of all creatures, the only survivors were two men
and two women who had the fortune to be in a canoe when the
flood came. The waters sank and they landed, but they found
themselves in a sad plight. Puluga recreated birds and
animals for their use, but the world was still damp and
without fire. The ghost of one of the peoples' friends took
the form of a kingfisher and tried to steal a brand from
Puluga's fire, but he accidentally dropped it on the
Creator. Incensed, Puluga hurled the brand at the bird, but
it missed and landed where the four flood survivors were
seated. After the people had warmed themselves and had
leisure to reflect, they began to murmur against the
Creator and even plotted to murder him. However, the
Creator warned them away from such rash action, explained
that men had brought the flood on themselves by their
disobedience, and that another such offense would likewise
be met with punishment. That was the last time the Creator
spoke with men face to face. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>,

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Thunder God demanded half of Bubo's crops, but Bubo
tricked him into taking the tops of taro and the roots of
rice. Thunder God retaliated by withdrawing rain from the
earth. Bubo led his people to open the copper sluice gate
of the heavenly river a crack, but Thunder God closed it
tight and lifted heaven higher so the people couldn't come
again. Bubo went to the Dragon King to demand water of him.
Dragon King refused, but he was forced to release his
stream when Bubo held him tight and the people plucked out
almost all his beard. By the third year, this stream dried
up. Bubo climbed the sun-moon tree on Mount Bachi to heaven
to fight Thunder God. Qigao, one of the thunder soldiers,
told Bubo that Thunder God was determined to kill people
with drought and pointed out his location. Bubo caught him
and made him promise to send rain in three days, but
Thunder God went back on his promise. Qigao brought world
that Thunder God was grinding his axe. Bubo put a slippery
surface on his roof and instructed his wife and children to
stand ready with clubs and a net. Thunder God came in a
rainstorm and tried to land on Bubo's house but slipped off
and was captured. Bubo imprisoned Thunder God in a granary,
warning his family not to give him an ax or any water, but
his children, Fuyi and his sister, were enticed to give him
some indigo ink, and the moisture gave Thunder God the
strength to escape. The children were angry that he had
tricked them, but Thunder God promised that he would repay
them by saving them from the flood that he would bring in a
few days. He gave them one of his teeth and told them to
plant it. They did so, and it grew into a vine with a giant
gourd fruit. Fuyi and his sister scooped out the pith and
entered it. Thunder God breached the dike holding back the
river of heaven, and Dragon King, in revenge against Bubo's
plucking his beard, released his lake water, too. The water
rose over the mountains as high as heaven's ceiling. Bubo,
though, rode the waves floating on an inverted umbrella. He
made for the gate of heaven and attacked Thunder God,
chopping off his feet. (Thunder God later replaced them
with chicken feet.) Thunder God, with the help of Dragon
King, rapidly made the water subside so Bubo could not
reach him. Bubo and his umbrella dropped from the sky and
were smashed. Bubo's heart was thrown onto the ceiling of
heaven and remains there as the planet Venus. Fuyi and his
sister landed safely in the soft gourd. They wandered the
earth but found nobody else. They came across a turtle
which said the two of them should marry. Fuyi and his
sister said, "How can a brother and sister marry?" and said
if the turtle can come back to life after they beat it
death, they would marry. They beat it to death, whereupon
it laughed and crawled away. A bamboo also told them to
marry; they cut it down, and it came back to life and
laughed as they left. Venus spoke to them, told them to
build fires on two different mountains, and if the smoke
columns joined, they could marry. They did so, the smoke
columns came together, Venus laughed, and the brother and
sister married. They gave birth to a fleshball. Not knowing
what to do with it, they minced it up and scattered the
pieces, and the pieces became men and women. Qigao became a
worm, which Thunder God attacks when he comes to the
surface. [<a href="#Miller">L. Miller</a>, pp. 137-150]</p></p>

              <p>Sun Mountain (potentially)</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Grandpa Xiang and his wife Ya lived at the food of Sun
mountain, barely getting by. One day, there was a beautiful
rainbow after a downpour, and Xiang followed it as he
picked bamboo shoots. He saw an eagle clutch a tiny red
snake. In pity for the snake, Xiang yelled and threw his
basket at the eagle, which dropped the snake and flew away.
Xiang saw the snake disappear in a flash of light, and a
column of smoke drifted up the mountain. That night he
dreamed that a golden dragon thanked him for saving the
life of the dragon's daughter and told him to visit.
Grandma Ya had the same dream, so they set out, with their
grandchildren, across three mountain passes and up a long
slope, as the dream had directed. A beautiful girl came and
told them that she had gone out earlier, entranced by the
rainbow, and Xiang had rescued her. She led them to an
idyllic pond and invited them to settle there. They did,
and they grew younger and stronger from eating the fish of
the pool. After a year, Xiang went back to his village and
invited the people to live up on Sun Mountain with him.
They did so and lived happily for some time. But an evil
man wasted fish, polluted the pond, and finally poisoned
all the fish. One dying fish told Xiang to make it a
corn-flour body, feed it for 81 days on dew, and make a
wooden house for himself. He did so, and all the people
except the evil man made wooden houses. After 81 days, a
fierce gale came, while the sky darkened and lightning
flashed. The fish shook itself and turned into a girl and
then into the red snake, which flew off to join the golden
dragon Xiang had seen in his dreams. It told him to take
his things into his wooden house and stay there. Pelting
rain then fell from the sky, and soon there was a vast
flood. The evil man was helpless in his stone house, but
the wooden houses of the others floated. The golden dragon
shook his body, and the upper half of Sun Mountain erupted
into the sky. The body of the evil man was buried by the
falling stones. The others floated peacefully down the
mountain and carved a giant stone fish where they settled.
This statue and the lower part of Sun Mountain can be seen
near the town of Shuilong. [<a href="#Miller">L.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>When the Tsuwo ancestors were dispersed, a great flood
came, and everyone was forced to flee to the top of Mount
Niitaka-yama. In their haste, none had brought fire with
them, and the people suffered cold. Someone saw a sparkle
on the top of a neighboring mountain and asked who would go
to bring fire back. A goat volunteered, swam to the other
mountain, and brought back a burning cord between its
horns, but it tired from the swim, and it drooped its head
and extinguished the fire before it made it back to land.
The people next sent out a <i>taoron</i> (?), which
succeeded in the quest; the people gathered around the
animal and patted it, which is why it has such shiny skin
and small body today. The people were unsure how to lower
the water. A wild pig offered to swim off and break a bank
lower in the river, and it asked the people to care for its
children if it drowned. The people agreed, the pig swam
off, and soon the flood water sank. The people decided to
make a new river, with the help of the animals, to prevent
another great flood. A snake guided the people and hollowed
out the bed of the stream. Thousands of birds paved the
channel with pebbles. Other animals worked to fashion the
river banks and valleys. Only the eagle didn't help, and in
punishment, it is not allowed to drink from the river. The
goddess Hipararasa came from the south and formed plains by
crushing the mountains. At the central ranges, though, an
angry bear protecting its homeland confronted her and bit
and wounded her child, so the goddess desisted. The land
hardened, so the mountains still stand today. The survivors
from Mount Niitaka-yama, in groups, wandered their various
ways. The idea of headhunting originated while they lived
on that mountain. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.

the snake managed to escape into the ocean. Immediately a
great flood covered the world. The ancestors of the Bunun
escaped to Mount Usabeya (Niitaka-yama) and Mount Shinkan,
where they lived by hunting until the waters receded. They
returned to find their fields washed away, but a stalk of
millet remained. They planted its seeds and subsisted on
its produce. Before the flood, the land had been quite
flat; many mountains and valleys were formed by it. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 232-233]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The god Kakumodan Sappatorroku and the goddess Budaihabu
descended to a place called Taurayan with the boy Sura, the
girl Nakao, a pig and a chicken. One day, two other gods,
Kabitt and Aka, while hunting nearby, saw the pig and
chicken and coveted them. They asked Kakumodan for them,
but as they had nothing to trade, they were refused. This
angered them, and they plotted to kill Kakumodan. They
called upon the four sea gods, Mahahan, Mariyaru,
Marimokoshi, and Kosomatora, who consented to help. They
told Kabitt and Aka that in five days, when the moon was
full, the sea will make a booming sound, and they should
escape to a mountain where there are stars. On the fifth
day, the two gods fled to a mountain, and when they reached
the summit, the sea began booming and rising. Kakumodan's
house was flooded, but he and his wife escaped by climbing
a ladder to the sky. In their haste, though, they forgot
the children, and upon reaching safety, they futilely
called for them. Sura and Nakao, however, had climbed into
a wooden mortar and had floated to safety to the Ragasan
mountain. The brother and sister, now alone in the world,
feared to offend the ancestral gods, but of necessity they
became man and wife. To mitigate the wrath of the gods,
they contacted each other as little as possible and
interposed a mat between them in their bed. They had three
sons and two daughters. During Nakao's first pregnancy, the
first grain of millet was found in her ear, and in time the
two learned the proper ritual for cultivating that grain.
[<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 226-227]</p>
<p>In an earthquake, mountains tumbled down, the earth
gaped, and hot subterranean waters gushed out and flooded
the whole earth. Two sisters and a brother escaped in a
wooden mortar and floated south to Rarauran. They landed
and climbed Mount Kaburugan to view the countryside; then
the sisters searched south and the brother searched west
for good land. Finding none, they returned and ascended to
the mountain's summit again. But the older sister tired
half way up, and when the other two returned for her, they
found she had turned into a rock. The brother and sister
wanted to return to their homeland, but the mortar was
rotten and no longer sea-worthy. Wandering away on foot,
they saw smoke in the distance and, fearing another
eruption and flood, hastened away. But the sister collapsed
in exhaustion, and they had to remain. Catastrophe ceased
to threaten, and they decided to settle there. They were
uncertain whether it would be proper for them to marry, so
they asked the sun as it rose the next morning. The sun
answered immediately that they may marry. A few months
later, the wife conceived, but she delivered only two
abortions. They threw these in the river. One went straight
down and became the ancestor of fish, and the other swam
across and gave rise to crabs. Next morning, the brother
asked the moon why their offspring should be fish and
crabs. The moon answered that marriage between brother and
sister is strictly prohibited, but as they can find no
other mates, they must place a mat between them in their
marriage bed. They heeded this advice, and the wife soon
gave birth to a stone. They were again distraught and were
about to throw the stone in the river, but the moon told
them they must care for it nevertheless. Later, they
settled in a rich land called Arapanai, and in time the
brother died. Pitying the woman's loneliness, the moon told
her that she would soon have companions. Just five days
later, the stone swelled up and four children came from it,
some shod and some barefoot. Those with shoes were probably
the ancestors of the Chinese. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 227-229]</p>
<p>A brother and sister escaped a great deluge in a wooden
mortar. They landed on a high mountain, married, had
children, and founded the village of Popkok in a hollow of
the hills, where they thought themselves safe from another
deluge. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 104]</p></p>

              <p><p>A great drought dried up all the rivers. The old men
suggested digging in a river bed to find the soul of the
river. After three days of digging, a great spring gushed
forth rapidly enough to kill many of the diggers. While the
Ifugaos celebrated the waters, a storm came, the river kept
rising, and the elders advised people to run for the
mountains, as the river gods were angry. Only two people
made it to safety, a brother and sister, Wigan and Bugan,
on the separate mountains Amuyao and Kalawitan. Both had
enough food on the summits, but only Bugan had fire. After
six months, the waters receded, creating the rugged terrain
that exists today. Wigan traveled to his sister on Mt.
Kalawitan, and they settled in the valley. The sister later
found herself with child and ran away in shame, following
the course of the river. The god Maknongan, appearing as an
old man, assured her that her shame had no foundation,
since she and her brother would repopulate the world. [<a href="#Demetrio">Demetrio</a>, p. 262; <a href="#Dixon">Dixon</a>, pp. 179-180]</p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The earth once rested on the three horns of the giant
snake Naga Padoha, who grew tired of its burden and shook
it off into the sea. The god Batara Guru, to recover it
from the abyss, sent his daughter Puti-orla-bulan (who had
requested the mission). She came down on a white owl and
accompanied by a dog, but they found no place to rest.
Batara Guru let Mount Bakarra fall from heaven for her
abode; from it, the rest of the habitable earth gradually
arose. Puti-orla-bulan had three sons and three daughters
from whom the human race is descended. Later, the earth was
replaced onto the head of the snake, and there has been a
constant struggle between the snake, wanting to be free of
its burden, and the deity. Batara Guru sent his son
Layang-layang-mandi ("Diving Swallow") to bind Naga
Padoha's hands and feet, but the serpent still struggles
and causes earthquakes, and it will again throw the earth
into the sea when it breaks its fetters. When this happens,
men will either be transported to heaven or cast into a
flaming cauldron; the sun will approach close to our world,
and its flame will join with the cauldron's fire to consume
the material universe. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
217-218; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 133]</p>
<p>Debata, the Creator, sent a flood to destroy every
living thing when the earth grew old and dirty. The last
pair of humans took refuge on the highest mountain, and the
flood had already reached their knees, when Debata repented
his decision to destroy mankind. He tied a clod of earth to
a thread and lowered it. The last pair stepped onto it and
were saved. As the couple and their descendants multiplied,
the clod increased in size, becoming the earth we inhabit
today. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 100]</p></p>

she searched for food and finding none inland, went to the
beach hoping to catch a fish. She found a fish, but it hid
in one of the corpses left by the flood. She picked up
stone and hit the corpse, but the fish escaped and headed
inland. She followed, but soon met a living man. The man
told her that he had to returned to life as a consequence
of somebody knocking on his dead body. The woman told him
her story, and they returned to the beach and restored the
population by knocking on the drowned people. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 100-101]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Some women gathered bamboo shoots, sat on a log, and
began paring them. But they noticed the trunk exuded drops
of blood with each cut of their knives. Some men came by
and saw that the trunk was actually a giant, torporous boa
constrictor. They killed it, cut it up, and took it home to
eat. While they were frying the pieces, strange noises came
from the frying pan and a torrential rain began. The rain
continued until only the highest hill remained above water.
Only a woman, dog, rat, and a few small creature survived.
The woman noticed that the dog had found shelter from the
rain under a creeper warmed by the rubbing between the
creeper and a tree in the wind. She took the hint, rubbed
the creeper against a piece of wood, and produced fire for
the first time. The woman took the fire-drill for her mate
and gave birth to a son called Simpang-impang. He was only
half a man, with only one arm, one leg, etc. Some time
later, the Spirit of the Wind carried off some rice which
Simpang-impang had spread out to dry. Simpang-impang
demanded compensation. The Spirit of the Wind refused but
was vanquished in a series of contests and restored
Simpang-impang's missing parts. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 101-102]</p>
<p>When the flood came, a man named Trow made a boat from a
large wooden mortar previously used for pounding rice. He
took with him his wife, a dog, pig, cat, fowl, and other
animals, and rode out the flood. Afterwards, to repeople
the earth, Trow fashioned additional wives out of a log,
stone, and anything else handy. Soon he had a large family
which became the ancestors of the various Dyak tribes. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 102]</p>
<p>Once, when much of a ripe harvest was found despoiled, a
watch was kept, and a great serpent was seen to lower
itself from the sky and feed on the rice. People rushed up
and cut off its head, and one of the men fed on some of the
flesh the following morning. No sooner had he done so,
however, when a terrible storm arose, causing a flood which
killed all but the few who escaped to the highest hills.

The mouse got it down for her, but demanded in recompense

They prayed to the sea to return to its old bed. The sea
answered, "I will do so, if you give me an animal whose
hairs I cannot count." A pig, goat, dog, and hen failed
this test, but when the man threw in a cat, the sea sank
abashedly. An osprey appeared and sprinkled some dry earth
on the waters, and the family descended to a new home. The
Lord commanded that the osprey bring all kinds of seed to

people still set up a sheaf of rice as an offering to Mount

              <p><strong>Dangun, Gojoseon, Korea</strong></p>
              <p>Mount Myohang</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The story of Dangun, the founder of Gojoseon, Korea's first kingdom, is contemporary with that of Gun-Yu. It involves the cataclysm survivor staying in a cave on the tip of Mount Myohang for 100 days. It goes as follows:</p>
<p>In Korean mythology, Dangun's ancestry legend begins with his grandfather Hwanin (환인; 桓因), the "Lord of Heaven". Hwanin had a son, Hwanung, who yearned to live on the earth among the valleys and the mountains. Hwanin permitted Hwanung and 3,000 followers to descend onto Taebaeksan (written as Myohyang-san in samguk sagi, but now believed to be Paektu Mountain),[5] where Hwanung founded Sinsi (신시; 神市, "City of God"). Along with his ministers of clouds, rain and wind, he instituted laws and moral codes and taught humans various arts, medicine, and agriculture.[6] Legend attributes the development of acupuncture and moxibustion to Dangun.[7]</p>
<p>A tiger and a bear prayed to Hwanung that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them twenty cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.[8]</p>
<p>The bear-woman, Ungnyeo, was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a "divine birch" tree (신단수; 神檀樹; shindansu) to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named Dangun Wanggeom.[9]</p>
<p>Dangun ascended to the throne, built the walled city of Asadal situated near Pyongyang (the location is disputed), and called the kingdom Joseon—referred to today as Gojoseon so as not to be confused with the later kingdom of Joseon that was established roughly 2000 years later. He then moved his capital to Asadal on Mount Paegak or Mount Gunghol.[10]</p></p>

              <p>cocorite trees on the highest hill</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Makunaima created the birds and animals and put his son,
Sigu, in charge of them. Makunaima created a great tree
from which all food plants grew. Agouti discovered it first
but kept it secret, but Sigu sent Rat to follow him, and
the secret was out. Sigu decided it would be best to chop
down the tree and plant the seeds and cuttings so that the
food would be widespread. This they did, but Iwarrika, the
monkey, didn't help, so Sigu sent him to fetch water with
an open-work basket. When the tree was felled, the animals
discovered the hollow stump was filled with water
containing all kinds of fresh-water fish. But the water
began overflowing and threatened to flood the land, so Sigu
wove a magic basket and covered the trunk with it. When
Iwarrika returned, he saw the basket and, thinking the best
fruits were under it, lifted it to look. A torrent of water
flooded out and covered the countryside. Sigu led the birds
and climbing animals to tall cocorite trees on the highest
hill. He led the other animals to a cave and covered its
entrance with wax, first giving them a long thorn with
which to pierce the wax to determine when the water went
down. Many days of darkness and storm followed. The red
howler monkey cried in anguish so much at the cold and
hunger that his throat swelled and remains so to this day.
Sigu stayed with the birds in the cocorite tree,
occasionally dropping seeds. He heard that it took longer
and longer for them to hit water as the water dropped, and
eventually they thudded on the ground. At that moment, the
sky grew lighter. The trumpeter bird was in such a hurry to
descend that he flopped into an ant's nest, and the insects
gnawed his legs to the bone, giving his present appearance.
Sigu rubbed two pieces of wood together to make fire, but
the bush-turkey mistook the first spark for a firefly,
gobbled it up, and burnt his throat, explaining why turkeys
have red wattles today. The alligator was generally
unpopular and was accused of having stolen the spark. To
try to retrieve the spark, Sigu tore out the animal's
tongue, so alligators today have no tongue to speak of. The
plants which had been planted sprang to life, but the fish
were not distributed evenly. Monkeys are as curious as ever
but are now afraid of water. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>,

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>In olden times before the moon existed, the Muyscas
lived as savages. A bearded old man with the names
Botschika, Nemquetheba, and Zuhe came and taught them
agriculture, crafts, religion, and government. His wife,
with the names Huythaca, Chia, and Yubecayguya, was
beautiful but malicious. To destroy the good works of her
husband, she magically caused the river Funza (Rio Bogota)
to flood the whole Cundinamarca plateau. Only a few people
escaped to the mountain tops. Botschika banished her from
earth and changed her into the moon. Then he opened a pass,
and the water poured down in the Tequendama waterfall,
leaving Lake Guatavita. The country dried and was
cultivated by the survivors. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>,
p. 140; <a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, pp.
173-175]</p>
<p>Offended by people's wickedness, Chibchachun, the
tutelary god, sent the torrents of Sopo and Tibito down
from the hills, flooding the plain. This made cultivation
impossible and threatened to submerge the people, who had
fled to the mountains. The people appealed to the
culture-hero Bocicha. Appearing as a rainbow, he struck the
mountain with his staff and provided an outlet for the
waters, creating the waterfall of Tequendama. Chibchachun
was driven under the ground and made to hold it up
(replacing the lignum-vitae trees which had held it
before). His restlessness causes earthquakes. The rainbow,
Chuchaviva, was thence honored as a god, but Chibchachum,
in revenge, proclaimed that many would die when it appears.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The daughter of Rahaririyoma went to a river to fetch
water. Omauwä (one of the first beings) and his
brother Yoawä found her and copulated with her; then
Omauwä changed the girl's vagina into a mouth with
teeth. Howashiriwä, another of the first beings, then
saw her and seduced her, but her vagina bit off his penis.
Then the son of Omauwä became very thirsty.
Omauwä and Yoawä dug a hole for water, but they
dug so deep that water gushed forth and covered the jungle.
Many drowned. Some of the first beings survived by cutting
down trees and floating on them. This was such a strange
thing to do that they became foreigners and floated away,
and their language gradually became unintelligible. The
Yanomamö survived by climbing mountains, namely Maiyo,
Howashiwä, and Homahewä. Raharariyoma painted red
dots all over her body and plunged into the lake, causing
it to recede. Omauwä then caused her to be changed
into a <i>rahara</i>, a dangerous snake-like monster that
lives in large rivers. Omauwä went downstream and
became an enemy of the Yanomamö, sending them hiccups
and sickness. [<a href="#Chagnon">Chagnon</a>, pp.

telling them to throw the fruits of the Mauritia palm over

from those thrown by the woman. (This tradition occurs also

              <p><p>Two boys found that the game they had hunted for a feast
kept disappearing while they were gone. One stayed in camp
and discovered a large snake was responsible. They built a
fire to drive the snake out of the hollow in a tree, where
it lived. The snake fell in the fire, and one of the
brothers ate some of its roasted flesh. He became very
thirsty, drank all the water in camp, and went to the lake.
He was transformed first into a frog, then a lizard, and
finally into a snake, which grew rapidly. His brother was
frightened and tried to pull him out, but the lake began to
overflow. The snake told his brother that the lake would
continue to grow and all the people would perish unless
they made their escape. The snake told him to take a
calabash and flee to a palm tree on the highest mountain.
The brother told his people what was happening, but they
didn't believe him. He fled to the top of a palm tree on
the top of a mountain and returned many days later when the
waters had subsided. Vultures were eating the dead people
in the valley. He went to the lake and carried away his
brother in a calabash. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp.

<p>A great cloud fell from heaven, turned to rain, and
killed all the inhabitants of earth. Only a man and his two
sons were saved. One of the sons was cursed by his father;
the Jivaros are descended from him. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p>
<p>According to some Jivaro, the flood was survived by a
man and woman, who took refuge in a cave on a high mountain
along with samples of all the various animal species. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p>
<p>Two brothers survived the flood in a mountain which rose
higher and higher with the flood waters. They went looking
for food after the flood, and when they returned, found
food set out for them. To find its source, one of the
brothers hid himself and saw two parrots with the faces of
women enter their hut and prepare the food. He jumped out,
seized one of the birds, and married it. From this union
came three boys and three girls from whom the Jivaros are
descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p></p>

He did so, met the woman, and followed her underwater to
her father's house. The woman's mother gave him an
aphrodisiac, and he became her husband. When he returned to
his home on earth, she took the form of a snake. She became
pregnant, and the man had to go out hunting. While he was
out, his two earthly wives discovered the snake and
tormented her, and she returned to her father. Tsunki, in a

and one of his daughters, who escaped to a mountaintop.
These two repopulated the world. [<a href="#Bierhorst1988">Bierhorst, 1988</a>, p. 218]</p></p>

dark as night, so he dropped a palm fruit from time to

he knew the flood had subsided. He climbed down, built a

piece of his flesh and planted it; from this grew a woman,

mountain Huaca-yñan. As the water rose, the mountain
also rose. When the water lowered and their provisions were
consumed, the brother descended, built a small house, and
ate herbs and roots, living a miserable existence of hunger
and toil. One day, they returned home to find food and
<i>chicha</i> drink prepared. After ten days of this, to
find out who their benefactor was, the elder brother hid
and presently saw two macaws, dressed like Cañaris,
enter the house and begin to prepare food they had brought
with them. The man saw that they were beautiful and had
faces of women, and he came out of hiding. But the birds
became angry and left when they saw him, leaving no food.
The younger brother came home and heard the story, and both
were angry. The next day, the younger brother decided to
hide. After three days, the macaws returned. The two men
waited until the birds had finished cooking and then shut
the door. The birds were angry, and the larger one escaped
as the brothers held the small one. The brothers took the
macaw as a wife; by her they had six sons and daughters,
from whom the Cañari are descended. Macaws and the
hill Huaca-yñan are venerated by the Indians today.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The world wanted to come to an end. A llama buck,
knowing that the ocean would soon overflow, was depressed.
When its human owner complained that it wouldn't eat, the
llama told him that the flood would occur in five days and
suggested they go to Villca Coto mountain with five days'
food. The man left in a hurry, carrying both the llama and
the supplies. They arrived at the mountain to find the peak
already filled with all kinds of animals. The flood came as
soon as they arrived and lasted five days, then it dried to
the ocean's normal position. The fox's tail was soaked,
which turned it black. Afterwards, the man began to
multiply once more. [<a href="#Salomon">Salomon &amp;
Urioste</a>, pp. 51-52]</p>
<p>Paria Caca, a god born from five falcon eggs, heard
about a man called Tamta Namca who called himself a god and
had himself worshipped, and about other people's sins. He
went into a rage, rose up as rain, and washed them all away
to the ocean, together with their homes and llamas. At that
time a tree called the Pullao formed an arch between the
Llantapa and Vichoca mountains; in it lived monkeys,
toucans, and other birds. These too were swept to sea. [<a href="#Salomon">Salomon &amp; Urioste</a>, pp. 59-60]</p>
<p>Paria Caca went to the village Huauqui Usa, which was
celebrating a festival. He sat at the end of the banquet
like a stranger. No one offered him a drink while he sat
there, until at the end of the day a woman finally did so.
Paria Caca told the woman that these people had made him
mad, told her that in five days something terrible would
happen to the village, and warned her to take her family
away and not to tell anyone else, or he might kill her,
too. Five days later, the woman and her family left. The
other villagers continued drinking without a care. Paria
Caca climbed Matao Coto, a mountain which overlooks the
village, and rising up as red and yellow hail, caused a
torrential rainstorm. It washed all the villagers to the
ocean and shaped the slopes and valleys of the area. [<a href="#Salomon">Salomon &amp; Urioste</a>, pp. 61-62] He
similarly exterminated another village where no one offered
him a drink. [<a href="#Salomon">Salomon &amp; Urioste</a>,
p. 127]</p>
<p>The Inca summoned people from every village to help
defeat their enemies. Paria Caca sent his child Maca Uisa.
When nobody else at the meeting offered to help, Maca Uisa
said he would defeat the enemies completely. Strong litter
bearers carried him to the battle front, and as soon as he
got there, he started raining on them, gently at first,
then pouring rain. He washed away their villages in a
mudslide and killed their strong men with lightning bolts.
Only a few common people were spared. [<a href="#Salomon">Salomon &amp; Urioste</a>, p. 115]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Pictorial records of ancient Incan rulers show that a
flood rose above the highest mountains. All created things
perished, except for a man and woman who floated in a box.
When the flood subsided, the floating box was driven by the
wind to Tiahuanacu, about 200 miles from Cuzco, where the
Creator told them to dwell. The Creator molded new people
from clay at Tiahuanacu. On each figure, the Creator
painted dress and hair style, and he gave each nation
distinctive language, songs, and seeds to plant. When he
had brought them to life, he ordered them into the earth to
travel underground and emerge from caves, springs, tree
trunks, etc. in their various homes. He then created the
sun, moon, and stars. [<a href="#Bierhorst1988">Bierhorst, 1988</a>, pp. 200,202; <a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 127; <a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 271]</p>
<p>The creator god Viracocha made the earth and sky, and he
created stone giants to live in it. After a while the
giants became lazy and quarrelsome, and Viracocha decided
to destroy them. Some he turned back to stone, and these
stone statues still exist at Tiahuanaco and Pucara. He
destroyed the rest with a great flood. When the flood
subsided, it left the lakes Titicaca and Poopo, and it left
seashells on the Altiplano at elevations of 3660 m.
Viracocha saved two stone giants from the flood and with
their help created people his own size. He reached down
into Lake Titicaca and drew out the Sun and Moon to provide
light so he could admire his new creation. In those days,
the Moon was even brighter than the Sun, but the Sun grew
jealous and threw ashes onto the Moon's face. [<a href="#Gifford">Gifford</a>, p. 54]</p>
<p>A large, rich city once existed on the Altiplano. One
day, a group of ragged Indians came and warned the proud
inhabitants that the city would be destroyed by earthquake,
flood, and fire. Most inhabitants just scoffed and
eventually had the ragged people flogged and thrown out.
Some of the city's priests, though, heeded the warning and
went to live as hermits in a temple on a hill. Some time
later, a red cloud appeared on the horizon. Soon it had
grown and covered the area, and its red glow eerily lit the
night. Suddenly, with a flash and a rumble, an earthquake
destroyed many of the city's buildings, and a red rain
poured down. Other earthquakes and more rain followed, and
a flood soon covered the ruined city; this water is Lake
Titicaca today. None of the city's inhabitants survived
save the priests. The descendants of the prophets became
the Callawayas, wise men of the valleys. [<a href="#Gifford">Gifford</a>, pp. 55-56]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>A medicine man named Sommay had two sons, Tamendonare
and Ariconte. Tamendonare tilled the ground and was a good
husband and father. Ariconte was interested only in war.
One day he returned from battle with the arm of a slain foe
and accused his brother of cowardice. Tamendonare
sarcastically asked why he didn't bring the whole carcass.
Ariconte threw the arm at his brother's door, and at that
moment, their village was transported to the sky, leaving
the two brothers on earth. Tamendonare stamped on the
ground so hard that a fountain of water sprang forth into
the sky; the water continued until the whole world was
covered. The brothers fled to the highest mountains and
climbed trees. Tamendonare climbed a <i>pindona</i> tree,
helping one of his wives up with him, and Ariconte climbed
a <i>geniper</i> tree with his wife. All other people
drowned. Ariconte's wife dropped fruit and heard from the
splash when the water was still too high for them to climb
down. Two different peoples, who are perpetually feuding,
are descended from these two couples. The Tupinambo exalt
themselves over the Tominu by claiming descent from
Tamendonare. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
254-255]</p>
<p>The great god Tupi warned a medicine man named
Tamanduare of a coming great flood that would cover the
earth, and he told Tamanduare to seek refuge on a lofty
peak with a palm tree at its top. Tamanduare and his family
went there immediately, and when they arrived, it began to
rain. It continued to rain until the whole earth was
flooded. The water covered even the summit of the mountain,
and Tamanduare and his family climbed into the palm tree
and live there, eating its fruit, until the water subsided.
Then they descended and repopulated the devastated world.

              <p><p>The Carayas, hunting pigs, drove them into their dens
and began pulling them out and killing them. In doing so,
they also came upon a deer, a tapir, a white deer, and
finally the feet of a man. They fetched a magician, who
drew the man from the earth. This man was Anatiua; he had a
thin body but fat paunch. He sang that he wanted tobacco,
but the Carayas didn't understand him and offered him all
kinds of flowers and fruits until Anatiua pointed at a man
smoking. Then they gave him tobacco. He smoked it until he
fell senseless. They took him back to their village, where
he awoke and began to dance and sing. But his behavior and
unintelligible speech so alarmed the Carayas that they
packed up and left. This angered Anatiua, and he turned
himself into a giant piranha and followed them, carrying
many calabashes full of water. The Carayas didn't heed his
calls to stop, so he smashed his calabashes one at a time,
making the water rise until only the mountains at the mouth
of the Tapirape River were exposed. The Carayas took refuge
on the two peaks of those mountains. Anatiua called on the
fish to drag the people into the water. The <i>jahu</i>,
<i>pintado</i>, and <i>pacu</i> failed, but the
<i>bicudo</i> managed to scale the mountain from behind and
pull the people from the summit; a lagoon still marks where
they fell. Only a few people survived, who descended when
the flood had gone. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>A flood once covered the whole earth except for the top
of the coastal range Serra do Mar. Members of the three
tribes Coroados, Cayurucres, and Cames, swam for the
mountains holding lighted torches between their teeth. The
Cayurucres and Cames wearied and drowned, and their souls
went to dwell in the heart of the mountain. The Coroados
made it and stayed there, some on the ground and some in
the branches of trees. Several days passed without food and
without the water lowering. Then some <i>saracuras</i>, a
species of waterfowl, flew to them with baskets of earth.
The birds began throwing the earth into the water, and the
water sank. The people urged the birds to hurry, so the
birds called the ducks to help them. When the flood
subsided, the Coroados descended, except for the ones which
had climbed into trees, who became monkeys. The souls of
the Cayurucres and Cames burrowed their way out of the
mountain and kindled a fire. From the ashes of the fire,
one of the Cayurucres molded jaguars, tapirs, ant-bears,
bees, and many other animals; he made them live and told
them what they should eat. But one of the Cames similarly
made pumas, poisonous snakes, and wasps to fight the other
animals. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 125]</p></p>

offended by the people, so she let it snow so much that ice
came to cover the entire earth. This happened at the time
of Yáiaasága, when men seized power from the
women. When the ice melted, it rapidly flooded all the
earth. People hurried to their canoes, but many didn't make
it, and more perished when they couldn't find sheltered
places. Some people reached the five mountaintops which
stayed above the flood. These mountains were Usláka,
Wémarwaia, Auwáratuléra,
Welalánux, and Piatuléra. The water stayed at
its high mark for two days and then rapidly lowered. Signs
of the floodwaters still show up on those mountains. The
few families which survived rebuilt their huts on the

<p>The moon-woman Hánuxa caused the flood because
she was full of hatred against the people, especially the
men, who had taken over the women's secret <i>kina</i>
ceremony and made it their own. A few people survived on
five mountaintops. [<a href="#Wilbert">Wilbert</a>, p.

tumultuously and to cover all the earth except the summit

              <p>Aragaladi</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The woman Gulbin traveled from the south, looking for a
place to put herself as <i>djang</i>. At length, she killed
a snake, began cooking it, and slept while it cooked. But
the snake was the daughter of She who lives underground.
That snake made water rise, threatening to drown the woman,
and at last the Snake came up and ate her. Later the Snake
vomited her bones, which became like rock. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 84-85]</p>
<p>Two girls traveled, making places. With fires, they
attracted two men to marry them. But one day the four of
them killed the daughter of Ngalyod, the Rainbow Snake. The
mother came looking for her child, and they saw storm and
rushing water coming. They tried to escape by climbing
rocks, but the water rose and drowned them. The Snake ate
them, carried their bones for a long time, and vomited them
out in the same place, named Malbaid. They became like
rocks. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp.
279-280]</p>
<p>The first people were living in what is now the middle
of the sea. In ignorance, some of them knocked a
<i>maar</i> rock, a dangerous Dreaming rock. After they
went home, rain fell for a long time, and fresh water came
running in search of them. In panic, the people swam around
trying to get to dry land. There was no place they could go
except for the rock Aragaladi, but Aragaladi was not a real
rock; Snake had made it rise up for them. Snake came
looking for the people, urinating salt water. A man came
from the mainland in a canoe, but he drowned in the middle
of the sea. Snake came and swallowed the people and later
vomited their bones. She made the place deep with sea
water. Those first people became rocks. Nobody goes to
Aragaladi now. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>,
pp. 88-89]</p>
<p>An orphan boy was crying because the people in the
community were preoccupied with a circumcision ritual and
didn't feed him well. When his brother returned from
hunting and saw how thin he was, he told the people, "I'm
very sorry for my little brother. I'll finish all of you!"
He took Rainbow eggs and broke them, and water "jumped out"
and spread. The man took his brother up a hill, where he
became a rock. He went further up and became a rock
himself, along with his baskets. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt
&amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 93-94]</p>
<p>Some people came from north and danced the
<i>nyalaidj</i> ceremony. While they danced, one girl
climbed a pandanus palm and was calling out, and an orphan
boy was crying. The people kept dancing. The crying and
calling upset the place, and water came up from underneath.
The people cried in fear, but they couldn't run away
because the ground became soft, and the water covered them.
Ngalyod the Rainbow Serpent ate them, first the people who
were calling out and the orphan who was crying. The name of
the place is Gaalbaraya; it is still a taboo place. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 96-97]</p>
<p>All the honeycombs that a man cut out were no good. He
went on and cut and ate a palm tree. He heard bees talking,
saying "Gu-gu" ["water"]. He ran back to others and told
them that he had unknowingly done wrong to a <i>djang</i>
palm tree. They tried to burn the tree, but water came up
from it. One girl ran up a hill calling out; the others
climbed a <i>manbaderi</i> tree. The tree fell, and those
in it drowned. The girl became a rock. The place is named
Gudju-mandi; nobody goes there now. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 100-101]</p>
<p>Two were traveling during the Dreamtime. One fell sick,
and the Wuraal bird came up. The other heard it and said,
"Maybe we're making ourselves wrong, coming into Dreaming."
That night, the bird repeatedly struck the dying one with
its claws, killing him. Water came up where it struck him.
The other tried to outrun the rising water, but he fell in
a hole, and all three went underwater and came into
Dreaming. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, p.

the whites were more powerful and had better spears and
boomerangs, so they came to feel superior and broke off
relations. Some time later, it rained for several months.
The river overflowed and forced the blacks to retreat into
the hinterland. When the rains stopped and the waters
receded, the blacks returned, to find that their neighbors
had vanished under a wide sea. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 166]</p></p>

a log in her opossum rug so it looked like her, left it by

and flew into a passion when the log dressed as a woman
wouldn't answer him. He kicked it, which only hurt his foot
and made him angrier. He began to paint himself white so
that he might fight the woman's husband. Another pelican
came up when he was halfway through with these
preparations, but not knowing what to make of the strange
half black and half white creature, pecked him and killed
him. That is why pelicans are now black and white. [<a href="#Dixon">Dixon</a>, pp. 279-280; <a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 113-114]</p></p>

              <p>Blue Mountain</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The animals, birds, and reptiles became overpopulated
and held a conference to determine what to do. The
kangaroo, eagle-hawk, and goanna were the chiefs of the
three respective groups, and their advisors were koala,
crow, and tiger-snake. They met on Blue Mountain.
Tiger-snake spoke first and proposed that the animals and
birds, who could travel more readily, should relocate to
another country. Kangaroo rose to introduce platypus, whose
family far outnumbered any others, but the meeting was then
adjourned for the day. On the second day, while the
conference proceeded with crow taunting koala for his
inability to find a solution, the frilled lizards decided
to act on their own. They possessed the knowledge of
rain-making, and they spread the word to all of their
family to perform the rain ceremony during the week before
the new moon. Thus would they destroy the over-numerous
platypus family. They did their ceremonies repeatedly, and
a great storm came, flooding the land. The frilled lizards
had made shelters on mountains, and some animals managed to
make their way there, but nearly all life was destroyed in
the great flood. When the flood ended and the sun shone
again, the kangaroo called animals together to discover how
the platypus family had fared. But they could not find a
single living platypus. Three years later, the cormorant
told emu that he had seen a platypus beak impression along
a river, but never saw a platypus. Because of the flood,
the platypuses had decided that the animals, birds, and
reptiles were their enemies and only moved about at night.
The animals organized a search party, and carpet-snake
eventually found a platypus home and reported its location
back to the others. Kangaroo summoned all the tribes
together, even the insect tribe. Fringed lizard was ejected
for doing mischief; he has turned ugly because of the hate
he dwells upon. The animals and birds found they were both
related to the platypus family; even the reptiles found
some relationship; and everyone agreed that the platypuses
were an old race. Carpet-snake went to the platypus home
and invited them to the assembly. They came and were met
with great respect. Kangaroo offered platypus his choice of
the daughter of any of them. Platypus learned that emu had
changed its totem so that the platypus and emu families
could marry. This made platypus decide it didn't want to be
part of any of their families. Emu got angry, and kangaroo
suggested the platypuses leave silently that night, which
they did. They met bandicoot along the way, who invited the
platypuses to live with them. The platypuses married the
bandicoot daughters and lived happily. Water-rats got
jealous and fought them but were defeated. Platypuses have
tried to be seperate from the animal and bird tribes ever
since, but not entirely successfully. [<a href="#WRSmith">W. R. Smith</a>, pp. 151-168]</p></p>

              <p><p>Long ago, there were a great many different tribes, and
they quarrelled and made war on each other. The worship of
Tane, the creator, was being neglected and his doctrines
denied. Two prophets, Para-whenua-mea and Tupu-nui-a-uta,
taught the true doctrine about the separation of heaven and
earth, but others just mocked them, and they became angry.
So they built a large raft at the source of the Tohinga
River, built a house on it, and provisioned it with
fern-root, sweet potatoes, and dogs. Then they prayed for
abundant rain to convince men of the power of Tane. Two men
named Tiu and Reti, a woman named Wai-puna-hau, and other
women also boarded the raft. Tiu was the priest on the
raft, and he recited the prayers and incantations for rain.
It rained hard for four or five days, until Tiu prayed for
the rain to stop. But though the rain stopped, the waters
still rose and bore the raft down the Tohinga river and
onto the sea. In the eighth month, the waters began to
thin; Tiu knew this by the signs of his staff. At last they
landed at Hawaiki. The earth had been much changed by the
flood, and the people on the raft were the only survivors.
They worshipped Tane, Rangi (Heaven), Rehua, and all the
gods, each at a separate alter. After making fire by
friction, they made thanks-offerings of seaweed for their
rescue. Today, only the chief priest may go to those holy
spots. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 110-112; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 133]</p>
<p>Two brothers-in-law of the hero Tawhaki attacked him and
left him for dead. He recovered, and retired with his own
warriors and their families to a high mountain, where he
built a fortified village. Then he called to the gods, his
ancestors, for revenge. The floods of heaven descended and
killed everyone on earth. This event was called "The
overwhelming of the Mataaho." [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 112]</p>
<p>In another version of the story, Tawhaki, a man, put on
a garment of lightning and was worshipped as a god. Once,
in a fit of anger, he stamped on the floor of heaven,
breaking it and releasing the celestial waters which
flooded the earth. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
112]</p>
<p>In another version, the flood was caused by the copious
weeping of Tawhaki's mother. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>,

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Zeus sent a flood to destroy the men of the Bronze Age.
Prometheus advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All
other men perished except for a few who escaped to high
mountains. The mountains in Thessaly were parted, and all
the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was
overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha (daughter of
Epimetheus and Pandora), after floating in the chest for
nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. When the rains
ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus, the God of Escape. At the
bidding of Zeus, he threw stones over his head; they became
men, and the stones which Pyrrha threw became women. That
is why people are called <i>laoi</i>, from <i>laas</i>, "a
stone." [<a href="#Apollodorus">Apollodorus</a>,
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.7.2" rel="external" target="_blank">1.7.2</a>]</p>
<p>The first race of people was completely destroyed
because they were exceedingly wicked. The fountains of the
deep opened, the rain fell in torrents, and the rivers and
seas rose to cover the earth, killing all of them.
Deucalion survived due to his prudence and piety and linked
the first and second race of men. Onto a great ark he
loaded his wives and children and all animals. The animals
came to him, and by God's help, remained friendly for the
duration of the flood. The flood waters escaped down a
chasm opened in Hierapolis. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 153-154]</p>
<p>An older version of the story told by Hellanicus has
Deucalion's ark landing on Mount Othrys in Thessaly.
Another account has him landing on a peak, probably Phouka,
in Argolis, later called Nemea. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 85]</p>
<p>The Megarians told that Megarus, son of Zeus, escaped
Deucalion's flood by swimming to the top of Mount Gerania,
guided by the cries of cranes. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 85-86]</p>
<p>An earlier flood was reported to have occurred in the
time of Ogyges, founder and king of Thebes. The flood
covered the whole world and was so devastating that the
country remained without kings until the reign of Cecrops.
[<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 87]</p>
<p>Nannacus, king of Phrygia, lived before the time of
Deucalion and foresaw that he and all people would perish
in a coming flood. He and the Phrygians lamented bitterly,
hence the old proverb about "weeping like (or for)
Nannacus." After the deluge had destroyed all humanity,
Zeus commanded Prometheus and Athena to fashion mud images,
and Zeus summoned winds to breathe life into them. The
place where they were made is called Iconium after these
images. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 155]</p>
<p>"Many great deluges have taken place during the nine
thousand years" since Athens and Atlantis were preeminent.
Destruction by fire and other catastrophes was also common.
In these floods, water rose from below, destroying city
dwellers but not mountain people. The floods, especially
the third great flood before Deucalion, washed away most of
Athens' fertile soil. [<a href="#Plato">Plato</a>,

Black Sea in a great torrent that washed over part of the
coast of Asia and the lowlands of Samothrace. The survivors
on Samothrace retreated to the mountains and prayed for
deliverance. On being saved, they set up monuments to the
event and built alters on which to continue sacrifices
through the ages. Fishermen still occasionally draw up
parts of stone columns in their nets, signs of cities
drowned in the sea. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.

              <p><p>Jupiter, angered at the evil ways of humanity, resolved
to destroy it. He was about to set the earth to burning,
but considered that that might set heaven itself afire, so
he decided to flood the earth instead. With Neptune's help,
he caused storm and earthquake to flood everything but the
summit of Parnassus, where Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha
came by boat and found refuge. Recognizing their piety,
Jupiter let them live and withdrew the flood. Deucalion and
Pyrrha, at the advice of an oracle, repopulated the world
by throwing "your mother's bones" (stones) behind them;
each stone became a person. [<a href="#Ovid">Ovid</a>,

<p>Jupiter and Mercury, traveling incognito in Phrygia,
begged for food and shelter, but found all doors closed to
them until they received hospitality from Philemon and
Baucis. The gods revealed their identity, led the couple up
the mountains, and showed them the whole valley flooded,
destroying all homes but the couple's, which was
transformed into a marble temple. Given a wish, the couple
asked to be priest and priestess of the temple, and to die
together. In their extreme old age, they changed into an
oak and lime tree. [<a href="#Ovid">Ovid</a>,

<p>One of the kings of Alba (named Romulus, Remulus, or
Amulius Silvius), set himself up as a god equal to or
superior to Jupiter. He made machines to mimic thunder and
lightning, and he ordered his soldiers to drown out real
thunder by beating on their shields. For his impiety, he
and his house were destroyed by a thunderbolt in a fierce
storm. The Alban lake rose and drowned his palace. You may
still see the ruins when the lake is clear and calm. [<a href="#Frazer1993">Frazer 1993</a>, p. 149]</p></p>

              <p><p>From his heavenly window, the supreme god Pramzimas saw
nothing but war and injustice among mankind. He sent two
giants, Wandu and Wejas (water and wind), to destroy earth.
After twenty days and nights, little was left. Pramzimas
looked to see the progress. He happened to be eating nuts
at the time, and he threw down the shells. One happened to
land on the peak of the tallest mountain, where some people
and animals had sought refuge. Everybody climbed in and
survived the flood floating in the nutshell. God's wrath
abated, he ordered the wind and water to abate. The people
dispersed, except for one elderly couple who stayed where
they landed. To comfort them, God sent the rainbow and
advised them to jump over the bones of the earth nine
times. They did so, and up sprang nine other couples, from
which the nine Lithuanian tribes descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 93]</p></p>

              <p><p>Yehl, the Raven, created man, caused the plants to grow,
and set the sun, moon, and stars in their places. Yehl's
wicked uncle had a young wife whom he was very fond and
jealous of. He did not want any of his nephews to inherit
his widow when he died, as Tlingit law dictates should
happen, so he murdered each of Yehl's ten older brothers by
drowning them or, according to some, by stretching them on
a board and beheading them. When Yehl grew to manhood, his
uncle tried to do the same to him. But Yehl's mother had
conceived him by swallowing a round pebble she had found at
low tide, and with another stone she had rendered him
invulnerable. When the uncle tried to behead Yehl, his
knife had no effect. In a rage, the uncle called for a
flood, and a flood came and covered all the mountains. Yehl
assumed his wings, which he could do at will, and soared
into the sky. He remained hanging by his beak from the sky
for ten days, while the water rose so high it lapped his
wings. When the water fell, Yehl let go, dropped like an
arrow onto a soft bank of seaweed, and was rescued by an
otter who brought him to land. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 316-317]</p>
<p>Raven had put a woman under the world to govern the
tides. Once he wished to see the undersea world, and he
caused the woman to raise the waters so that he might do so
while remaining dry. He directed her to raise the ocean
slowly so that people might have time to provision their
canoes. As the waters rose, bears and other animals were
driven to the mountaintops, and many of them swam out to
the people's canoes. Some people had taken dogs into their
canoes, and the dogs kept the bears off. Some people landed
on the tops of mountains, building dikes around them to
keep out the water. Uprooted trees, devil-fish, and other
strange creatures washed past. When the waters ebbed, the
survivors followed the tide down the mountain, but the
trees were all gone, and the people, having no firewood,
perished of cold. When Raven returned, he saw fish lying
high on the land, and he commanded them to turn to stone.
When he saw people coming down the mountain, he turned them
to stone also. When all mankind had been destroyed, he
created them anew out of leaves. That is why so many people
die during the autumn. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
317-318]</p>
<p>People were saved from a universal deluge in a giant
ark. The ark struck a rock and split in two. The Tlingits
were in one half of the ark, and all other people were in
the other half. This explains why there is a diversity of
languages. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 119]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>A man called the Mariner (<i>Etroetchokren</i>) was the
first person to build a canoe. One day, he rocked it side
to side, causing waves which flooded the earth and
floundering the canoe. He scrambled into a giant hollow
straw that floated past, caulked up the ends, and floated
safely until the flood dried. He landed on a high mountain,
called the Place of the Old Man today, near Fort MacPherson
in the Rockies. The Mariner straddled a rapid stretch of
the Yukon River and, dipping with his hands, drew out dead
bodies of men as they floated past, but he found none
living. The only living thing he saw was a raven high on a
rock, gorged with food and fast asleep. The Mariner climbed
to the raven, grabbed it, and stuck it in his sack. The
raven begged not to be cast down, saying the man would find
no other surviving men without the raven's help. The man
dropped the bag anyway, and the bird was dashed to pieces.
But though the man searched far and wide, he could find
nothing else living except a loach and a pike sunning
themselves on the mud. He went back to the raven,
reassembled its bones, and blew on them to restore the
flesh and return the raven to life. They returned to the
beach, and the raven told the man to bore a hole in the
belly of the pike, while it did the same to the loach. A
crowd of men emerged from the hole in the pike, and women
came out of the loach. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.

the country transforming things until they themselves were
transformed into stones. Three men escaped in a canoe and
drifted to the Nzukeski Mountains, where they and their
canoe were afterwards turned to stone; you may see them
there today. Coyote survived by turning himself into a
piece of wood and floating. When the flood subsided,
leaving him in the Thompson River area, he resumed his
normal shape. He took trees to be his wives, and from them
the Indians are descended. The flood left lakes in the
hollows of the mountains, streams flowing from them, and
fish in them; none of these existed before the flood. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 322]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Very long ago, a flood covered everything but three
mountains, one near Bella-Bella, one northeast of there,
and a hill called Ko-Kwus on Don Island which rose with the
flood to stay above the water. Nearly all people floated on
logs and trees in different directions. Some people had
small canoes with anchors and managed to land near their
homes when the water subsided. Of the Hailtzuk only two
men, a woman, and a dog survived. One of the men landed at
Ka-pa, one at another village site, and the woman and dog
at Bella-Bella. The Bella-Bella Indians descended from the
marriage of the woman and dog. There was no fresh water
when the flood subsided. The raven showed people where they
could dig for a little water and how chewing on cedar
brought water into their mouths. This sustained them until
a great rain came which filled the lakes and rivers. It is
still understood, though, that without cedars there would
be no water. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 321]</p></p>

              <p><p>A small gray bird, despite the prohibition of her
husband (a chicken hawk, <i>Accipiter cooperi</i>), bathed
in a certain lake after picking berries in the hot sun.
There she was seized and raped by a giant in the lake. The
bird's husband shot the monster, who in revenge swallowed
up all the water to keep others from having it. The woman
pulled out the arrow, and the water rushed forth in a
torrent. The husband and wife escaped to a mountain until
the flood receded. (In variant versions, the woman was
seized by a giant fish or water animal. The husband killed
it, and its blood caused the flood. The husband escaped up
a tree.) [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp. 147-148; <a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 323]</p></p>

a council and decided to make a giant canoe. The men worked
day and night to make this canoe, the biggest ever, and the
women made a long rope of oiled cedar fibers with which
they tied the canoe to a giant rock. They put every baby
into the canoe, with food and water. They selected the
bravest young man and the mother of the youngest baby to go
as their guardians. No one cried as the waters rose and
drowned everyone else. After several days, the man saw a
speck far to the south. By the next day, he could see that
it was a mountain top, Mount Baker. He cut the rope and
paddled to it, and made a new home there. The outline of
the canoe can still be seen halfway up the slope of Mount
Baker. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, pp. 42-43]</p></p>

the country. A man named Ntcinemkin took refuge with his
family in his very large canoe. The others fled to the
mountains, but the flood rose to cover them, too. The
people begged Ntcinemkin to save at least their children.
He didn't have room enough to hold all of them, so he took
one child from each family, alternating males and females.
The flood covered all land except the peak of Split
Mountain (<i>Ncikato</i>) on the west side of Lower
Lillooet Lake. When the waters dropped, the canoe grounded
on Smimelc Mountain. Each stage of the water's dropping is
marked by a terrace on the side of the mountain, which can

Spirit's direction, the man shot an arrow into a cloud,
then another arrow into that arrow, and so on, making a
rope of arrows from the cloud to the ground. The good
animals and people climbed up. Bad animals and snakes
started to climb up, but the man broke off the rope. Then
the Great Spirit caused many days of rain, flooding up to
the snow line of Takhoma (Mount Ranier). After all the bad
people and animals were drowned, the Great Spirit stopped
the rain, the waters slowly dropped, and the good people
and animals climbed down. To this day there are no snakes
on Takhoma. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, pp. 31-32]</p>
<p>Once a big flood came. People made ropes of twisted
cedar limbs and used them to fasten their canoes to

speak the same language. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, p.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The Creator made the earth and gave four names for it --
for the sun, waters, soil and forests. He said only a few
people, with special preparation for the knowledge, should
know all four names, or the world would change too
suddenly. After a while, everyone learned the four names.
When people started talking to the trees the change came in
the form of a flood. When the people saw the flood coming,
they made a giant canoe and filled it with five people and
a male and female of all plants and animals. Water covered
everything but the summit of Kobah and Takobah (Mts. Baker
and Ranier). The canoe landed on the prairie. Doquebuth,
the new Creator, was born of a couple from the canoe. He
was told to go to a lake (Lake Campbell) and swim and fast
to get his spirit powers, but he delayed. Finally he did so
after his family deserted him. The Old Creator came to him
in dreams. First he told Doquebuth to wave his blanket over
the water and the forest and name the four names of the
earth; this created food for everyone. Next, at the
direction of the Old Creator, he gathered the bones of the
people who lived before the flood, waved the blanket over
them and named the four names, and made people again. These
people couldn't talk, so he similarly made brains for them
from the soil. Then they spoke many different languages,
and Doquebuth blew them back to the places they lived
before the flood. Someday, another flood will come and
change the world again. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, pp.

that Dokibatl, the Changer, flooded the earth. All living
things were destroyed except one woman and one dog, which
survived atop Tacobud (Mt. Ranier). From them the next race
of people were born. They walked on four legs and lived
like animals. To make matters worse, a huge and powerful
bear came from the south. It had the power to paralyze with
its gaze whatever it wanted to eat, and it threatened to
eat all the people. The Changer sent a Spirit Man from the
east to teach them civilization. He showed them how to make
and use bows, canoes, clothing, fire, etc., and taught them
about the spirits and the potlatch custom. He killed the
bear with seven arrows, and he put all the ills of the
world in a large building, but years later a curious
daughter peeked in the building and let them out. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, pp. 136-138]</p></p>

water rose over it. Some of the canoes broke their moorings
and drifted west; those people formed a tribe to the west
which speaks a language like that of the Twanas. Because
those people drifted away, the present Twana tribe is
small. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 324]</p></p>

from the largest cedar they could find. Soon after the
canoe was finished, the flood came, filling the valleys and
covering the mountains. The bad people were drowned; the
good people were saved in the boat. We don't know how long
the flood stayed. The canoe came down where it was built

they were all swept away and drowned except for one pair
who found safety on the highest peak. They lived on fish,
which they cooked by placing them under their arms. They
had no fire, and, as everything was wet, they could not get
any. The waters sank, and all present Indians descended
from that couple. When the Indians died, their spirits took
the forms of various animals and insects, so the earth was
repopulated by animals also. The Indians, still lacking
fire, looked to the moon, whose fire shone brightly. The
Spider Indians and Snake Indians hatched a plan. The Spider
Indians went to the moon in a gossamer balloon, but they
kept the balloon fastened to the earth by a long rope. The
Indians on the moon were suspicious of the newcomers, but
the Spider Indians assured them that they had only come to
gamble. As they played games around the fire, a Snake
Indian climbed up the rope, darted through the fire, and
escaped down the rope again before the Moon Indians could
react. When he reached the earth, he had to travel over
rocks, sticks, and trees, and everything he touched has
henceforth contained fire. The Spider Indians were long
kept prisoners on the moon. When they were finally released
and returned to earth, ungrateful men killed them, fearing
vengeance from the Moon Indians. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 289-290]</p></p>

the whole valley became like an ocean. Many Indians were
overtaken by the waters, and the frogs and the salmon
overtook and ate many others. Only two escaped to the
hills, but the Great Man made them fruitful, so the world
was soon repopulated with many tribes. One man was a chief
of great renown over all the nations. He went to a knoll
overlooking the waters that covered the fertile plains of
his ancestors. For nine sleeps he lay there without food,
meditating on how that water had come there. At the end of
nine sleeps, he was changed so that no arrow could harm
him. He commanded the Great Man to let the waters flow from
the plains. The Great Man opened the side of a mountain,
and the waters flowed away to the ocean. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 290-291]</p></p>

him, and found many ducks and geese. His grandfather Olle,
Coyote-man, taught him how to make and use a sling. Wekwek
went back to the area, killed hundreds of birds, gathered
them, and brought them back to Olle. The next day, Wekwek
saw Sahte, Weasel-man, coming and going and was curious
about him. Wekwek followed Sahte north to Clear Lake and
found his home while Sahte was out. He found several sacks
of shell-bead money there and took it all back with him.
When Sahte returned, he wanted to find out who stole his
money. He set fire to one end of a stick and pointed it in
different directions. When it pointed south towards the
thief, the flame leaped from the stick and spread
southward. Wekwek was concerned when he saw that the
country to the north was on fire, and he told Olle. Olle
knew the reason for the fire, but he said only, "The people
up there are burning tules." When the fire came close so
that Wekwek thought they would soon burn, he confessed to
Olle that he had stolen the money and hidden it in the
creek. Olle then took a sack from his roundhouse and beat
it against an oak tree, creating fog. He beat another sack
against the tree, causing more fog, and then rain. He said
the rain would last for ten days and nights. The rain
covered all the land except the top of Mount Konokti.
Wekwek flew around in the rain and eventually found that
refuge. On the tenth day, the rain stopped, and the water
started going down. After about a week, the land was bare
again. At that time, there were no real people in the
world. Olle took the feathers of the geese that Wekwek had
killed at Wennok lake. They traveled over the country, and
whenever they found a good site, Olle laid two feathers
side by side. The next morning, each pair of feathers had
turned into a man and a woman. Later, Wekwek commented to
Olle that the people had no fire, and Olle sent Wekewillah,
the Shrew-mice brothers, to steal fire from Kahkahte, the
Crow, who had it at his roundhouse. They succeeded, and
Olle put the fire in the buckeye tree. [<a href="#Merriam">Merriam</a>, pp. 138-151]</p></p>

              <p><p>A fight between the great forces of Good and Evil was
followed by an immense flood. It wiped out all traces of
the previous world and covered all the earth except two
islands. Coyote, the only living thing in the world, stood
on one of the islands (Mount Diablo or Pico Blanco). One
day, he saw a feather floating on the water. It turned into
Eagle as it reached the island. Later, they were joined by
Hummingbird. This trio created a new race of people. Eagle
told Coyote how to find a wife but did not tell him how to
make children. Coyote told the girl to louse him and to
swallow the woodtick she found. She became pregnant from
this. Afraid, she ran away to the ocean and turned into a
sand flea. Coyote found another wife and with her went out
over the world, founding five tribes with five different
languages. [<a href="#Margolin1978">Margolin 1978</a>, pp.

              <p><p>Coyote dreamed that water would soon cover the world,
but nobody believed him. It rained, and the water started
rising. The people climbed trees because there were no
mountains to escape to. Coyote and a number of people
escaped on a log. With the help of Mole, Coyote created
mountains; then he created people for the new world. [<a href="#Roheim">Roheim</a>, p. 153]</p>
<p>One day, the Thunder People found trout in their spring.
At first, the people were afraid of them, but driven by
hunger, the people ate them, except for three children who
were warned by their grandmother not to eat them. The next
morning, all but those three children had been transformed
into deer. The children went to a very high mountain. Rain
came and flooded all but the mountaintop. The children
asked an old man what he could do; he said he didn't know,
but he dug all night while the children slept. In the
morning, he woke the children. The flood was gone, and the
world was beautiful. [<a href="#Roheim">Roheim</a>, pp.

<p>Everyone but Gopher was killed in a flood. He climbed to
the top of Mt. Kanaktai, and just as the water was about to
wash him off, it receded. He had no fire, so he dug into
the mountain until he found fire inside, thus bringing fire
again to the world. [<a href="#Roheim">Roheim</a>, p.

<p>Coyote lived with two little boys whom he had got by
deceit from one of the Wood-duck sisters. Everybody abused
the boys, so Coyote decided to set the world on fire. He
dug a tunnel at the east end of the world, filled it with
fir bark, and lit it. With his two children in a sack, he
called for rescue from the sky. Spider descended and took
Coyote back up through the gates of the sky. When they came
back, everything was roasted. Coyote drank too much water
and got sick. Kusku the medicine man jumped on his belly,
and water flowed out and covered the land. [<a href="#Roheim">Roheim</a>, p. 154]</p></p>

              <p>top of a mountain</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The medicine man Wis-kay-tchach recognized all animals
as his relations, and he considered some wolves to be his
brother and two nephews. To stave off starvation one hard
winter, they went hunting and came across the track of a
moose. Wis-kay-tchach and the old wolf stopped to smoke
while the two young wolves hunted the moose, but they
didn't return, so the older two went after them. They found
that the young wolves had eaten all of the moose. Wis made
a fire, and when he had done so, the moose was restored
again, already cut up. The young wolves divided the spoils
into four, but one of them retained the tongue and upper
lip. Wis grumbled, and the young wolves gave the delicacies
to him. They made marrow fat, but soon this was also eaten,
and they began to hunger again. They separated, with Wis
and one young wolf hunting together. The wolf killed some
deer, brought them home in his stomach, disgorged them on
his arrival, and told his uncle that he could catch no
more. Wis spent the night setting enchantments. In the
morning, he told his nephew to go hunting, but warned him
to throw a stick over every valley and hollow place before
jumping over, or some evil would befall him. The wolf,
following a deer, forgot this warning, jumped a hollow, and
fell into a river where he was killed and devoured by water
lynxes. Wis followed when his nephew didn't return. When he
came upon the river, he guessed what had happened, and this
was confirmed when a kingfisher told him it saw the wolf
skin serving as a door mat of the water lynxes. The bird
also told him that the water lynxes often come ashore, and
Wis must turn himself into a stump close by to get his
revenge. In gratitude, Wis began to put a ruff around the
bird's neck, but the bird flew off before Wis could finish,
which is why kingfishers have only part of a ruff at the
back of their head. Wis returned to his camp to prepare;
among other things, he provided a large canoe and in it
embarked all animals that could not swim. He returned to
the area of the lynxes before daybreak, transformed himself
into a stump, and waited. The black one crawled out of the
water, then the gray one. Then the white one, who had
killed the wolf, emerged, but it grew suspicious on seeing
the stump. It sent frogs and snakes to try to pull it down,
but Wis kept himself upright. The lynx, suspicions lulled,
went to sleep. Wis returned to normal shape and, though
warned to shoot the lynx's shadow, forgot and shot its
body. He shot a second arrow at the shadow, wounding the
animal, but the lynx escaped into the river, which then
overflowed and flooded the whole country. Wis escaped in
his canoe and began rescuing the animals which could swim
only a short time. Wis then tied a string around the leg of
a loon and told it to dive for some earth, assuring it that
he could restore it to life if it drowned. When the line
ceased to play out, Wis hauled up the drowned loon, which,
when restored to life, said that it had found no bottom.
Wis next send an otter, then a beaver on the same errand,
with similar results. Finally he send a rat fastened to a
stone, and the rat, when hauled up, had a little earth in
its paws. He dried the earth and blew on it to expand it.
He sent a wolf to explore it, but the wolf soon returned,
saying it was too small. He blew on it a long time, then
sent a crow to explore. The crow didn't return, so Wis
decided the land was big enough and disembarked with all
the animals. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 297-301; <a href="#Roheim">Roheim</a>, p. 157, Kelsen, p. 147]</p>
<p>Nenebojo went hunting every day while his brother stayed
home. One day, he returned to find his brother missing. His
searching brought him to the shore of a lake, where he saw
a kingfisher looking into the water. The bird would not
tell Nenebojo what it saw until Nenebojo painted its
feathers; then it said it saw Nenebojo's brother, whose
skin the water-spirits were using as a door flap. It also
told where the water-spirits sun themselves. Nenebojo went
there and, using his rod, assumed the shape of a rotten
stump for a disguise. When the lions came out of the water,
they were suspicious of the new stump until one broke off a
piece and saw it was rotten. When they had gone to sleep,
Nenebojo struck them on their heads with his rod. As he did
so, the lake's water rose. He fled; a woodpecker directed
him to a tall pine tree on a mountain. Nenebojo climbed the
tree and began building a raft, which he finished just as
the waters reached his neck. He put pairs of all kinds of
animals on the raft and floated about. After a while, he
sent otter to dive for some earth, but the otter returned
without any. Next, beaver was sent, but in vain. Next he
sent muskrat, who returned with a little sand in its claws
and mouth. He dried the grains and blew them into the water
with the horn he had used to summon the animals. They
formed an island, which Nenebojo enlarged. He sent a raven
to determine its size, but it didn't return. He next sent a
hawk, which reported back that the raven had been eating
dead bodies on the shore, so Nenebojo cursed the raven
never to have anything to eat but what it steals. After
another interval, Nenebojo sent a caribou to explore the
size. It said that the island was still too small, so
Nenebojo grew it once more and finished. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 305-306]</p>
<p>Menaboshu regarded all animals as his kin. Once, when
times were bad, he asked the wolves for some food. The food
was so good that he asked to hunt with them, which they
allowed. After ten days of hunting, they reached a
crossroads; the wolves determined to go one way, and
Menaboshu went another, taking with him a little wolf whom
he loved dearly as a brother. They then hunted sometimes
together and sometimes alone. Menaboshu warned the wolf to
stay away from a certain lake, knowing that his worst enemy
the serpent-king lived there. But this warning just made
the wolf curious, and three days later he ventured out on
the ice of the lake. The ice broke under him, and he was
drowned. Menaboshu waited five days for the wolf's return;
then he began wailing, knowing that the serpent-king had
got him. Menaboshu could not get the serpent-king in the
winter, so he came to the lake in the spring. He set up
loud lamentations when he saw the footprints of his lost
brother there. This attracted the attention of the
serpent-king, and when Menaboshu saw it stick up its head,
he immediately turned himself into a tree stump. The
serpent-king and other serpents saw nothing unusual but the
new tree stump. Suspicious of it, the serpent-king sent one
large snake to it. This snake squeezed hard enough to crack
Menaboshu's bones, but he bore the pain stoically. The
snakes then went to sleep on the beach. Menaboshu emerged
from his disguise, grabbed his bow and arrows, and shot
dead the serpent-king and three of its sons. The other
snakes escaped into the water, making much noise and
lashing with their tails. Some snakes scattered the
contents of their medicine bags; the waters began to swell,
and torrents of rain fell from the newly gathered clouds.
In short time, the whole earth was flooded. Menaboshu fled,
hopping from mountain to mountain, but the waves followed
him. He climbed to the top boughs of a fir tree on the top
of one tall mountain, and the waters stopped rising just as
they reached his mouth. Menaboshu stayed there five days
and nights. Finally, he saw a loon swim by, and he asked it
do dive for some earth. The loon did so repeatedly, but
without success. Then Menaboshu saw the body of a drowned
muskrat. He breathed on it to restore it to life and asked
it to dive. The muskrat dived and, though it came up dead,
it had a few grains of earth. Menaboshu dried these and
blew them over the water. Where they landed, they grew into
islands, and these grew together, with Menaboshu's
guidance, into continents. Menaboshu then wandered around
breathing on the corpses of animals to bring them back to
life and otherwise restoring nature and land to its former
beauty. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 301-304]</p>
<p>Wenebojo travelled awhile with five wolves. The oldest
wolf became distrustful of Wenebojo and decided they should
leave him, but one wolf, who liked Wenebojo, stayed with
him and hunted food for him, and Wenebojo considered him
his nephew. One night, this wolf didn't return from
hunting. Wenebojo followed his tracks the next day and saw
that he had fallen into a river. The <i>manidog</i>, or
spirits under the water, caused the wolf's death because
there wouldn't be any wild animals left if Wenebojo had his
own way. Wenebojo went to the bank of a lake where the
<i>manidog</i> sometimes come out to sun themselves; he
turned himself into a stump and waited four days. At last,
the <i>manidog</i> came out to bask. A big snake was
suspicious that the stump was Wenebojo, so he went and
squeezed it four times, harder and harder each time, but
Wenebojo withstood it, and the snake said it wasn't
Wenebojo. When all the <i>manidog</i> were asleep, Wenebojo
shot the two kings, wounding them. All the <i>manidog</i>
rushed back into the water. Wenebojo followed the stream
and came across a kingfisher, which said it was waiting for
Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float by. Wenebojo had a string
of beads that had belonged to his nephew, and he offered
them to the bird with the secret intent of strangling it,
but his hand slipped and the bird escaped with the beads,
which is why the kingfisher's head is bushy and it has a
necklace of white spots. Wenebojo went on and met an old
lady carrying basswood bark. He told her he wasn't
Wenebojo, and the old lady told him that they were laying
out basswood to detect Wenebojo, and that she was doctoring
the wounded kings. Wenebojo learned her song and her route;
then he killed her, skinned her, and put on her skin. He
had to shave off his calf muscles to make it fit. With this
disguise, he got entrance into the king's house. He saw his
nephew's skin hanging there, which made him angry. Two
snakes on either side of the door watched him suspiciously,
but he told them his medicine wouldn't work with them
watching. He went to the kings and pushed his arrows
deeper, killing them. He ran out, breaking through basswood
strings in his escape. The <i>manidog</i> saw the basswood
moving and sent water there. Wenebojo heard the water
coming and ran for a hill. Soon the water came to the top
of the hill, and he climbed a tall pine tree there. The
water kept coming, and he told the pine tree to stretch
itself to double its length. It did that four times but
could not stretch more. The water stopped rising just short
of Wenebojo's mouth. Wenebojo had to defecate, and the
feces floated around his mouth. Wenebojo saw an otter and
asked it to dive for some earth. The otter tried, but it
drowned. Wenebojo blew on it, and it came back to life and
told him that it hadn't seen anything. A beaver got farther
but also failed. Next, the muskrat tried. It also floated
up drowned, but Wenebojo found a grain of earth in each of
its paws and in its mouth. He restored the muskrat to life,
dried the grains in the sun, and threw them on the water,
forming a small island. The three animals and Wenebojo went
on the island, and Wenebojo took handfuls of dirt from the
island and threw them around, making it bigger. Other
animals came from the water to the island, too. Wenebojo
asked a caribou to run around the island to test its size.
The caribou soon returned and reported that the land wasn't
big enough yet. Wenebojo threw more dirt far and wide and
sent the caribou off again, but the caribou never came
back. It got tired and stayed in the north. For a long
time, Wenebojo travelled, having forgotten about his anger.
But one day he happened to remember, and he sat crying. He
threatened to pull up the four layers below the earth and
pull down the four layers of the sky to get at the
<i>manidog</i> there. The first <i>manido</i> from below
the earth and the Great Spirit <i>manido</i> from the sky
believed he would do that, and they invited him to meet
with them, but he wouldn't come until they sent a white
otter (seal?) as a messenger. Wenebojo didn't have any
parents, so they created parents for him. The <i>manido</i>
from the bottom formed a clay figure, shook his rattle and
talked, and the figure came to life. It was an Indian
woman. The Great Spirit put the last rib from the woman
into a clay figure and likewise created a man. The
<i>manidog</i> also told Wenebojo about the Medicine Dance.
The people were meant to live forever, but Wenebojo's
brother Nekajiwegizik hadn't been invited. He was the first
person to die, and he decreed that everyone who lived on
earth would have to follow his road to the other world. [<a href="#Barnouw">Barnouw</a>, pp. 33-45]</p>
<p>For a time, Wenebojo travelled with a pack of wolves
which he considered his nephews. When they parted, one of
the wolves stayed with him and hunted for him. Wenebojo had
a dream that the <i>manidog</i>, evil underwater spirits
who were jealous of him, would kill his nephew, so he told
his nephew not to cross any streams. But the wolf tried to
jump a stream while hunting and was captured and killed.
Wenebojo knew what happened. He followed a river to a lake
and found a kingfisher in a tree looking into the water,
waiting for some of Wenebojo's nephew's guts to float by.
Wenebojo offered it a string of beads if it would tell him
what it knew. The bird described how the <i>manidog</i> sun
themselves. Wenebojo intended to wring the bird's neck as
he put on the beads, but the bird slipped away. That is why
the kingfisher has ruffled feathers around its neck.
Wenebojo prepared two arrows by rubbing them on the lips of
women having their first menses. Then he turned himself to
a stump by the lake and waited for the <i>manidog</i> to
sun themselves. When they emerged, the king was suspicious
of the stump and had a snake squeeze it and a bear claw it,
but Wenebojo withstood these attacks. Wenebojo wished the
<i>manidog</i> would go to sleep, and when they slept, he
shot and wounded the king and the next to the king; then he
ran away as the water was rising behind him. Woodchuck
saved him by digging a shelter, which they stayed in two
days until the water receded. Later, Wenebojo encountered
an old woman carrying basswood bark. He assured her that he
was not Wenebojo, and she told him that the bark would be
used to detect Wenebojo when he touched it, that she was
treating the wounded <i>manidog</i>, and that only she had
eaten his nephew. With that, he killed her, put on her
clothes, and wished himself to look like her. He went to
the wigwam of the wounded <i>manidog</i> and killed them.
As he ran away, he heard a roar of water behind him. He ran
to a bluff; a pine tree there told Wenebojo to climb it,
and the tree stretched higher, saving Wenebojo from the
flood with his nose barely above water. Wenebojo asked loon
to dive down to get some dirt, but the loon died in the
attempt. Otter and beaver failed similarly. Muskrat,
however, was able to get a few grains of dirt before he
passed out. Wenebojo used this dirt to recreate land. He
told a big bird to fly around it; the land would grow as it
did so. When the bird returned in four days, he sent an
eagle out to grow the land larger. Wenebojo cut up the body
of the king <i>manido</i> and made a lake of fat from it.
The animals that ate or touched it acquired fat in their
bodies. [<a href="#Barnouw">Barnouw</a>, pp. 63-69]</p>
<p>The evil serpent Meshekenabek carried off Manobozho's
cousin into a deep lake. Manobozho caused the sun to shine
fiercely on the lake to drive out Meshekenabek and his
companions. When they emerged, Manobozho shot an arrow into
the serpent's heart. The serpent, in his dying rage,
stirred up the waters of the lake and spread waves over the
land. Fleeing, Manobozho warned the Indians also to retreat
to a mountain top. The waters still rose, though, and
Manobozho made a raft for them to take refuge on. However,
Manobozho couldn't disperse the flood without some earth to
use as a nucleus. Muskrat finally succeeded in diving for
some dirt, and Manobozho used it to make the waters recede.
[<a href="#Howey">Howey</a>, pp. 291-293]</p>
<p>In the beginning of time, in September, there was a
great snow. A mouse nibbled a hole in the leather bag which
contained the sun's heat, and the heat escaped and melted
all the snow in an instant. The waters rose to cover even
the highest mountains. One old man had foreseen the flood
and warned everybody, but the others had thought to escape
to the hills; they drowned in the flood. The old man had
prepared a canoe and survived, rescuing animals he came
across. After a while he sent, in turn, the beaver, otter,
muskrat, and duck to find land. Only the duck returned,
with some mud in its bill. The old man cast the mud on the
water and blew on it, making solid land. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 170]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Manabush wanted to punish the evil manidoes, the Ana
maqkiu who had killed his brother Wolf. He invented the
ball game and asked the Thunderers to play against the Ana
maqkiu, who appeared from the ground as bears. After the
first day of play, Manabush made himself into a pine tree
near where the manidoes played. When they returned the next
morning, the manidoes were suspicious of the tree, so the
sent for Grizzly Bear to claw it and Serpent to strangle
and bite it. Manabush withstood these attacks, allaying
their suspicion. When the ball play took everyone else far
away, Manabush shot and wounded the two Bear chiefs with
arrows and then ran away. The underground Ana maqkiu soon
came back, saw the wounded Bear chiefs, and called for a
flood from the earth. Badger hid Manabush in the earth, so
the Ana maqkiu gave up the search just as the water was
starting to fill Badger's burrow. The underground people
took their chiefs to a wigwam and sent for an old woman to
heal them. Manabush followed, took the old woman's skin and
disguised himself in it. He entered the wigwam, killed the
two chiefs, and took the bear skins. The Ana maqkiu at once
pursued; water poured out of the earth in many places.
Manabush climbed a great pine tree on the highest mountain.
When the waters still rose to threaten him, he commanded
the tree to grow. This he did four times, but the waters
still rose. He called to Kisha Manido for help, who
commanded the waters to stop. Seeing water everywhere,
Manabush called to Otter to dive down and bring up some
earth. Otter tried but drowned before reaching bottom. Mink
failed similarly. Then Manabush called on Muskrat, who also
returned drowned but had some mud in his paw. Manabush blew
on Muskrat to return him to life. Then he took the earth,
rubbed it between his hands, and threw it on the water,
thus creating a new earth. Manabush told Muskrat that his
tribe would always be numerous. He gave the skin of the
Gray Bear chief to Badger and kept the skin of the White
Bear chief. [<a href="#Judson">Judson</a>, p. 21-25]</p></p>

              <p><p>The Great Spirit created three kinds of men: red men,
white men with hairy heads, and hairy men with hair all
over their body. The hairy men went to the barren south and
eventually dwindled in numbers and disappeared. The red men
went south after the Great Spirit taught them culture. They
went north again when the Great Medicine told them the
south would be flooded. In the north, they found that the
white men had gone and they could no longer talk to the
animals, though they could still control them. Later, they
went south again, but another flood came and scattered
them, and they never came together again. They traveled in
small bands to the north, but they found it barren, so they
returned south and lived the best they could. One
particularly hard winter had earthquakes, volcanoes, and
floods which destroyed all the trees. The people spent the
long winter in caves and were almost famished the following
spring. The Great Medicine, in pity, gave them corn and
buffalo. Since then, there have been no more famines or
floods. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>, pp.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>People came who hunted for sport, burned and cleared
forests, and didn't think of the animals as their brothers.
The Great Spirit was sad and let the people's smoke from
their fires lie in the valleys. The people coughed and
choked but continued their evil ways. The Great Spirit sent
rains to extinguish the fires and destroy the people. The
people moved to the hills as the waters rose. Spotted Bear,
the medicine man, said they would be safe as long as they
had buffalo, but there were no buffalo around. The young
men went hunting for buffalo, revising their treatment of
nature as they went. The waters rose, and people climbed to
the mountains. Finally, two men came back with the hide of
a white bull buffalo which had tried to climb to the
mountains but had drowned in the floodwaters, though a cow
and young buffalo survived. Spotted Bear announced that,
since the people were no longer destroying the world, that
buffalo would save those who were left. With help from
other medicine men, he scraped and stretched the hide,
stretching it over the whole village. Each day the wet hide
stretched farther, until it covered all of Yellowstone
Valley. Rain no longer fell in the valley, and people and
animals moved back there. The hide began to sag, but
Spotted Bear raised the west end to catch the West Wind,
which made the skin a dome over the valley. The Great
Spirit, seeing that people were living at peace with the
earth, stopped the rain. The sun shone on the hide,
shrinking it until all that was left was a rainbow arch.

              <p><p>The earth is a large tortoise. Once a tribe, digging for
badgers, dug deep into the earth and cut through the shell
of Tortoise. Tortoise began to sink, and water rose through
the knife cut. The water covered all the ground and drowned
all the people except one man, Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah, who
escaped in a large canoe to a mountain in the west. Today,
a plank structure called the "big canoe" stands in the
central plaza of a Mandan village. The Mandans celebrate
the subsidence of the flood every year with a ceremony
called <i>Mee-nee-ro-ka-ha-sha</i>, held when willow leaves
are fully grown because the twig that the turtle-dove
brought home had such leaves. In the ceremony, a man
representing the survivor collects edged tools from each
household; these are later thrown into a deep pool. If this
sacrifice is not made, the man says, another flood will
come and destroy everyone. [<a href="#Judson">Judson</a>,

              <p>tree on the highest pinnacle</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>In the world before this one, the people didn't know how
to behave or how to act human, and the creating power was
displeased. He placed three dry buffalo chips under a
sacred pipe rack and saved a fourth for lighting the pipe.
He sang three songs to bring rain, which caused the rivers
to overflow; then he sang a fourth song and stamped on the
earth. The earth split open, and water flowed from the
cracks and covered everything. The Creating Power floated
on the sacred pipe and his huge pipe bag. All people and
animals were destroyed except Kangi, the crow. It was very
tired and three times asked the Creating Power to make a
place for it to rest. The Creating Power opened his pipe
bag, which contained all manner of animals and birds, and
selected four known for their diving abilities. He sang a
song and commanded the loon to dive and bring up mud, but
the loon failed. Likewise, the water was too deep for otter
and beaver. But the turtle succeeded in bringing up a
little mud. The Creating Power took the mud and, singing,
spread it out on the water. After the fourth song, there
was enough land for himself and the crow. He waved two long
eagle feathers over the ground, and it spread until it
replaced the water. He named it the Turtle Continent. The
Creating Power thought, "Land without water is not good,"
and wept for the earth and the creatures he would put upon
it. His tears became oceans, streams, and lakes. He
scattered the animals across the land; they came to life
when he stamped on the ground. He created four colors of
people from red, white, black, and yellow earth. He created
the rainbow as a sign that there would be no more great
flood, but warned that he had destroyed the first world by
fire because it was bad, and the second world by flood, and
he would destroy this world too if people make it bad and
ugly. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>, pp.
496-499]</p>
<p>Unktehi, a water monster, fought the people and caused a
great flood. The people retreated to a hill, but the water
swept over them, killing them all. The blood gelled and
turned to pipestone. (Pipes made from that rock are sacred
today.) Unktehi was also turned to stone; her bones are in
the Badlands now, forming a long ridge. A giant eagle,
Wanblee Galeshka, swept down, saved one girl from the
flood, carrying her to a tree on the highest pinnacle, the
only place not covered by water. He made her his wife. She
bore twins, a boy and a girl, which are the ancestors of
the Sioux. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>, pp.
93-95]</p>
<p>Unktehi puffed up her body to make the Missouri
overflow, and the little water monsters, her children, did
the same with other streams and lakes. This caused a great
flood which covered the country. Only a few people escaped
to the highest mountain, and the waves threatened to kill
them. The thunderbirds liked people, so they fought the
water monsters for several years. In time, it became clear
that the thunderbirds were losing when they fought close,
so they retreated to the sky and, all together, sent their
lightning bolts. This burned the forests, boiled the water,
and turned the earth red hot, except where the people had
taken refuge. Unktehi and the water monsters were defeated.
Their bones can still be seen in the Badlands. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>, pp. 220-222]</p></p>

              <p>Tsisnatcin</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Before the Apaches emerged from the underworld, there
were other people on the earth. Dios told an old man and
old woman that it would rain forty days and nights. People
were warned to go to the tops of four mountains
(Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and another whose
identity isn't known), and not to look at the flood or sky.
The people didn't believe the old couple. When the rains
came, only a few people made it to the mountain tops and
shut their eyes. Those who looked at the flood turned into
a fish or frog (as did some who were caught in the flood);
if they looked at the sky, they turned into a bird. The
people sitting on the mountains were told, when they got
hungry, to think of food, and Dios would feed them. After
eighty days, Dios told the 24 people remaining to open
their eyes and come down. These 24 people went into 24
mountains. Eight other people survived the flood who were
able to travel by looking where they wanted to go, and they
were there. These people told the Apaches about the flood
before going into two mountains themselves. Dios told them
to stay there until the world is destroyed. Around the year
2000, when the Apaches dwindle in number, the surface of
the earth will again be destroyed, this time by fire. [<a href="#Opler">Opler</a>, pp. 111-113]</p>
<p>When people still lived in the underworld, the chief,
after an argument with his mother-in-law, decided that men
and women should live apart for awhile, so the men all
moved to the other side of a river, and the chief prayed to
Kogulhtsude (a water spirit) to widen the river. They lived
four years like this. The women's farms became less and
less productive, and they began to go hungry. The men
wanted sexual satisfaction and began some sexual
perversions; the older girls, likewise affected, began to
masturbate with elk horns, eagle feathers, and other
things. These things impregnated them and produced the
monsters that afterwards killed men. About that time,
Coyote found a baby in a whirlpool in the river and took it
out to raise himself. But the baby was Kogulhtsude's child,
and he sent water out to draw it back. Some people were
drowned and turned into frogs and fish; the other men and
women escaped together to a tall mountain. Coyote used his
magic to make the mountain grow, but the waters kept
rising, finally overflowing onto this world. The people
suspected Coyote was causing the trouble and found the baby
hidden under his coat. They threw the baby (which was
almost dead from drying) into the water, and the water
receded. The people went down into the underworld again.
When they later emerged, the surface of the earth was
covered with water from that flood. The four Holy Ones made
black, blue, yellow, and glittering hoops and threw them in
each compass direction, and the water receded. They
commanded the four winds to dry the land further. [<a href="#Opler">Opler</a>, p. 20, 265-268]</p>
<p>As the waters rose, a chief led his warriors into the
Superstition Mountains in Arizona. When it became clear
that even the mountain peaks would be submerged, the chief
told his braves that, rather than let them drown
ignominiously, he would turn then to stone. They are there
guarding the heights even today. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 170]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>After the earth had become peopled, the great eagle told
a seer in the Gila valley, on three occasions, to warn the
people about a great flood that would soon come, but the
seer ridiculed him and ignored his warnings. Scarcely had
the bird gone for the third time when a tremendous clap of
thunder was heard. When morning came, the earth trembled,
and a great green wall of water roared down the valley and
destroyed everything in it. Szeukha, son of Chiowotmahke
(Earth maker), saved himself by floating on a ball of pine
resin. When the water receded somewhat, he landed on a
mountain above the Salt River; his cave and tools can still
be seen there. Szeukha made a ladder that reached into the
clouds and went to fight the great eagle, whom he thought
had caused the flood. They fought long, but at last he
killed the eagle. He found the bones and corpses of the
people which the eagle had abducted and returned them to
life. He also rescued a pregnant woman and her child. The
eagle had stolen her and taken her for his wife. She became
the mother of the Pima people. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes
&amp; Ortiz</a>, pp. 473-475; <a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>,
p. 115]</p>
<p>The Creator, Earth Doctor, made the mountains, the
waters, the plants; he made the sun and moon in their
courses. Then he made all kinds of birds and creeping
things, and he made clay images and commanded them to
become living humans. They obeyed him, multiplied, and
spread over the earth. In time, as sickness and death were
still unknown, the population outran the available
sustenance, and people faced ever-increasing famine. The
Creator resolved to destroy the creatures he had made, so
he pulled down the sky, crushing to death all living
things. Then he restored the world and made humans again.
The earth gave birth to one known as Siuuhû or Elder
Brother. He spoke harshly to the Creator, and the Creator
feared him. Elder Brother shortened people's lives so that
they didn't multiply out of control as before. He resolved
further to destroy mankind entirely with a great flood. He
created a handsome youth to go among the Pimas, wed their
women, and beget children, staying with each wife only
until his first child was born. The first wife gave birth
four months after marriage and conception, and the
gestation periods became shorter with each successive wife,
until the last child was born at the time of the marriage.
(The people were amazed and frightened by the powers shown
by Elder Brother and his agent during these years.) This
last child's screams shook the earth, and it was he who
caused the flood. Meanwhile, Elder Brother had begun
fashioning, out of black gum, a jar in which to save
himself, and he announced his purpose to the Creator. The
Creator called the people together and warned them of the
nearing flood. He thrust his staff into the ground, boring
a hole all the way through the earth. Some people took
refuge in the hole. Other people appealed, futilely, to
Elder Brother. Elder Brother did tell coyote to find a big
log on which to float safely on the flood. Elder Brother
closed himself in the jar, known as Black House, and the
flood came. The jar bobbed on the waters until it came to
rest near the mouth of the Colorado River. It may be seen
there today; it is called Black Mountain. The Creator
survived the flood by enclosing himself in his reed staff
and floating. The coyote survived on his driftwood. Only
five sorts of birds survived, including the flicker and
vulture, by clinging to the sky with their beaks until a
god took pity on them and let them make nests from their
own down and float in them. Some people survived in the
hole which the Creator had made. Others survived in a
similar hole made by a powerful person called South Doctor.
Others appealed to the Creator, who told them to try to
find refuge on Crooked Mountain, and he directed South
Doctor to help them. South Doctor led the people to the
summit and, with his enchantments, four times raised the
mountain and arrested the rising waters, but then his
powers were exhausted. He threw his staff into the water,
where it cracked loudly. He sent a dog to see how high the
tide had risen, and when the dog reported that the water
was very near the top, the people were transformed into
stone. You may see them there today. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 283-287]</p>
<p>Because someone displeased the gods, a heavy rain began
pouring down, and water gushed from the broken ground,
swelling the rivers. For the first time, the wise Se-eh-ha
(Elder Brother) did not know what to do. Some people ran up
Slanting Mountain (Superstition Mountain) and prayed to the
Great Spirit to stop the flood, but when the water
threatened to swallow them up, they turned into rocks in
fright. Se-eh-ha and his brother Juvet-Makai (Earth
Medicine Man) hurriedly made canoes and rode out the flood
in them. Coyote used his magic to turn himself small and
crawl into his bamboo flute, in which he floated. Some
birds, including the swallow, buzzard, raven, oriole, and
hummingbird, clung to the sky with their bills. The flood
rose high enough to drench their tails, leaving them
drenched-looking for all time. The flood lasted four days,
and Se-eh-ha, Juvet-Makai, and Coyote were tossed in
different directions. Coyote landed on a high mountain near
the Colorado River; his flute was tightly stuck in the
rocks, so he left it there. He left to look for Se-eh-ha
and Juvet-Makai, finding them at Slanting Mountain
surveying the desolated land. Elder Brother rubbed some
dust off his chest onto the ground, where it turned into
ants. The ants began scattering the dirt, making it drier,
and Elder Brother said that is what he wants ants to do.
The three of them began making images to replace the lost
people. Elder Brother scolded Earth Medicine Man for making
his images so different, with one leg and one arm, and
Earth Medicine Man angrily threw away his images and sank
into the ground to find a place to live on the other side
of the earth. Elder Brother and Coyote placed their images
in a warm mud hut and waited for them to speak. Coyote's
images began laughing first; this displeased Elder Brother,
so he sprinkled cold water on them and threw them to the
cold north, where they became the Apaches. Coyote was
angered and disappeared as Earth Medicine Man had. After
four days, Elder Brother's images began laughing and
talking. They became the River People and repopulated the
Gila valley. (Later, Elder Brother became greedy and evil
and led Juvet-Makai's people to conquer the River People.)

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Back when the sun was closer to the earth, Coyote
foresaw the coming of a flood, gnawed down a great tree,
entered it, and sealed the opening. Montezuma, who was the
first person created by the Great Mystery, took warning
from Coyote and prepared a dugout canoe for himself atop
Monte Rosa. Only they survived the flood, which covered all
the land. They met again on the top of Monte Rosa, which
rose above the flood waters. To ascertain how much dry land
was left, the man sent Coyote to explore. Coyote reported
that there was sea to the west, south, and east, but
seemingly endless land to the north. The Great Spirit, with
the help of Montezuma, restocked the earth with men and
animals. Montezuma, with Coyote's help, taught them and led
them. Montezuma later became prideful and rebelled against
the Great Mystery, thus bringing evil into the world. The
Great Mystery raised the sun to its present height and,
with an earthquake, destroyed the tower that Montezuma was
building into the heavens, in the process changing
languages so that people could no longer understand animals
or other tribes. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>,

              <p><p>A great flood once forced the Zunis out of their valley
to take refuge on a nearby tableland. But the flood rose
nearly to the top of the tableland, and the people, fearing
it would drown them all, decided to offer a human sacrifice
to appease the angry waters. A youth and maiden, children
of two Priests of the Rain, were dressed in finery and
thrown into the flood. The waters began subsiding
immediately. The two young people turned to stone; they may
be seen as two great pinnacles rising from the tableland.

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Tumbainot, a righteous man, had a wife named Naipande
and three sons, Oshomo, Bartimaro, and Barmao. When his
brother Lengerni died, Tumbainot, according to custom,
married the widow Nahaba-logunja, who bore him three more
sons, but they argued about her refusal to give him a drink
of milk in the evening, and she set up her own homestead.
The world was heavily populated in those days, but the
people were sinful and not mindful of God. However, they
refrained from murder, until at last a man named Nambija
hit another named Suage on the head. At this, God resolved
to destroy mankind, except Tumbainot found grace in His
eyes. God commanded Tumbainot to build an ark of wood and
enter it with his two wives, six sons and their wives, and
some of animals of every sort. When they were all aboard
and provisioned, God caused a great long rain which caused
a flood, and all other men and beasts drowned. The ark
drifted for a long time, and provisions began to run low.
The rain finally stopped, and Tumbainot let loose a dove to
ascertain the state of the flood. The dove returned tired,
so Tumbainot knew it had found no place to rest. Several
days later, he loosed a vulture, but first he attached an
arrow to one of its tail feathers so that, if the bird
landed, the arrow would hook on something and be lost. The
vulture returned that evening without the arrow, so
Tumbainot reasoned that it must have landed on carrion, and
that the flood was receding. When the water ran away, the
ark grounded on the steppe, and its occupants disembarked.
Tumbainot saw four rainbows, one in each quarter of the
sky, signifying that God's wrath was over. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 330-331]</p></p>

              <p><p>A man clearing fields found the trees regrown overnight.
On the fifth day of this, he found that the Grandmother
Nakawe, goddess of the earth, did this, because she wanted
to talk to him. She told him that he was working in vain
because a flood was coming in five days. Per her
instructions, he built a box from the fig tree and entered
it with five grains of corn and beans of each color, fire
with five squash stems to feed it, and a black bitch. (In
other versions, the vessel was a canoe.) She closed him in
and caulked the cracks, and he floated in the flood for
five years, first floating south, then north, then west,
then east, then rising upward as the whole world flooded.
Finally the box came to rest on a mountain near Santa
Cantarina, where it can still be seen. The world was still
under water, but parrots and macaws pulled up mountains and
created valleys to drain the water, and the land dried. The
old woman, who had sat upon the box with a macaw during the
flood, turned to wind and disappeared. The man lived with
the bitch in a cave. Every evening he would return home
from work in the fields to find meals prepared. He spied
one day and found that the bitch took off her skin and
became a woman to do the work. He threw her skin into the
fire. She whined like a dog, but he bathed her in nixtamal
water, and she remained a woman. They repopulated the
earth. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 122-123; <a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, pp. 203-205]</p></p>

              <p><p>People in three previous ages were destroyed by being
devoured by jaguars, swept away by the wind and turned into
monkeys, and transformed into birds in a rain of fire. The
sun of 4 Water lasted 676 years; then the heavens came down
in one day, and the people were inundated and transformed
into fish. In the next age, Titlacahuan (Tezcatlipoca) told
a man known as Nata ("Our Father") and his consort Nene to
hollow out an aheuhuetl (cypress?) log and enter it during
the vigil of Toçoztli, when the heavens would come
crashing down. He sealed them in with a single ear of corn
apiece to eat. When they had finished eating all the
kernels, they heard the water declining. They exited the
log, found a fish, and made a fire to cook it. The gods
Citlallinicue and Citlallatonac complained that someone was
smoking up the heavens. Tezcatlipoca descended, struck off
the people's heads, and reattached them over their
buttocks; they became dogs. [<a href="#Markman">Markman</a>, pp. 132-133; <a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 274-275]</p>
<p>The deluge overwhelmed mankind. Only a man named Coxcox
(some call him Teocipactli) and a woman named Xochiquetzal
survived in a small bark. They landed on a mountain called
Colhuacan and had many children. These children were all
born dumb until a dove from a lofty tree gave them
languages, but different languages so that they couldn't
understand each other. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.

              <p><p>The Angel Gabriel warned Noéh that a flood was
coming because of mankind's sins. Noéh warned other
people, but they didn't believe him. He built an ark and
took pairs of all animals. The waters came; the Archangel
Saint Michael blew his trumpet. When the waters receded,
Noéh sent out a buzzard to see if the world was dry,
but it stayed out to eat dead animals. The crow was then
sent; it returned to say that the world was drying. Then
the turtledove and parroquet went and reported back that
the world was dry, and Noéh and the animals left the
ark. The buzzard became ugly because of his actions, and
the trip of a person unmindful of his mission is called a
"buzzard's trip." Petela, a great Zapotec chieftain of
Ocelotepeque, was descended from the survivors of the
flood. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, p.
192,213]</p>
<p>In another version, the buzzard stayed to eat the dead
and was condemned to be a scavenger. A heron was sent next,
fulfilled its mission, and was allowed to eat fish as a
reward. A raven was sent, and its obedience was rewarded by
permitting it to eat fruit and corn. A dove then went and
reported that the earth was almost dry, and it was granted
freedom. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, p. 212]</p>
<p>The earth was dark and cold. The only inhabitants were
giants, and God was angry with them for their idolatry.
Some giants, feeling that a flood was coming, carved
underground houses for themselves out of great slabs of
rock. Some thus escaped destruction and may still be found
hidden in certain caverns. Other giants hid in the forests
and became monkeys. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>,

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The gods, led by Enlil, agreed to cleanse the earth of
an overpopulated humanity, but Utnapishtim was warned by
the god Ea in a dream. He and some craftsmen built a large
boat (one acre in area, seven decks) in a week. He then
loaded it with his family, the craftsmen, and "the seed of
all living creatures." The waters of the abyss rose up, and
it stormed for six days. Even the gods were frightened by
the flood's fury. Upon seeing all the people killed, the
gods repented and wept. The waters covered everything but
the top of the mountain Nisur, where the boat landed. Seven
days later, Utnapishtim released a dove, but it returned
finding nowhere else to land. He next returned a sparrow,
which also returned, and then a raven, which did not
return. Thus he knew the waters had receded enough for the
people to emerge. Utnapishtim made a sacrifice to the gods.
He and his wife were given immortality and lived at the end
of the earth. [<a href="#Sandars">Sandars</a>, chpt. 5]</p>
<p>Sharur destroyed Asag, demon of sickness and disease, by
flooding his abode. In the process, "The primeval waters of
Kur rose to the surface, and as a result of their violence
no fresh waters could reach the fields and gardens." [<a href="#Kramer">Kramer</a>, p. 105]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The god Chronos in a vision warned Xisuthrus, the tenth
king of Babylon, of a flood coming on the fifteenth day of
the month of Daesius. The god ordered him to write a
history and bury it in Sippara, and told him to build and
provision a vessel (5 stadia by 2 stadia) for himself, his
friends and relations, and all kinds of animals. Xisuthrus
asked where he should sail, and Chronos answered, "to the
gods, but first pray for all good things to men." Xisuthrus
built a ship five furlongs by two furlongs and loaded it as
ordered. After the flood had come and abated somewhat, he
sent out some birds, which returned. Later, he tried again,
and the birds returned with mud on their feet. On the third
trial, the birds didn't return. He saw that land had
appeared above the waters, so he parted some seams of his
ship, saw the shore, and drove his ship aground in the
Corcyraean mountains in Armenia. He disembarked with his
wife, daughter, and pilot, and offered sacrifices to the
gods. Those four were translated to live with the gods. The
others at first were grieved when they could not find the
four, but they heard Xisuthrus' voice in the air telling
them to be pious and to seek his writings at Sippara. Part
of the ship remains to this day, and some people make
charms from its bitumen. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
108-110; <a href="#Smith">G. Smith</a>, pp. 42-43]</p>
<p>According to accounts attributed to Berosus, the
antediluvians were giants who became impious and depraved,
except one among them that reverenced the gods and was wise
and prudent. His name was Noa, and he dwelt in Syria with
his three sons Sem, Japet, Chem, and their wives Tidea,
Pandora, Noela, and Noegla. From the stars, he foresaw
destruction, and he began building an ark. 78 years after
he began building, the oceans, inland seas, and rivers
burst forth from beneath, attended by many days of violent
rain. The waters overflowed all the mountains, and the
human race was drowned except Noa and his family who
survived on his ship. The ship came to rest at last on the
top of the Gendyae or Mountain. Parts of it still remain,
which men take bitumen from to make charms against evil.

              <p>Mount of Olives</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>God, upset at mankind's wickedness, resolved to destroy
it, but Noah was righteous and found favor with Him. God
told Noah to build an ark, 450 x 75 x 45 feet, with three
decks. Noah did so, and took aboard his family (8 people in
all) and pairs of all kinds of animals (7 of the clean
ones). For 40 days and nights, floodwaters came from the
heavens and from the deeps, until the highest mountains
were covered. The waters flooded the earth for 150 days;
then God sent a wind and the waters receded, and the ark
came to rest in Ararat. After 40 days, Noah sent out a
raven, which kept flying until the waters had dried up. He
next sent out a dove, which returned without finding a
perch. A week later he set out the dove again, and it
returned with an olive leaf. The next week, the dove didn't
return. After a year and 10 days from the start of the
flood, everyone and everything emerged from the ark. Noah
sacrificed some clean animals and birds to God, and God,
pleased with this, promised never again to destroy all
living creatures with a flood, giving the rainbow as a sign
of this covenant. Animals became wild and became suitable
food, and Noah and his family were told to repopulate the
earth. Noah planted a vineyard and one day got drunk. His
son Ham saw him lying naked in his tent and told his
brothers Shem and Japheth, who came and covered Noah with
their faces turned. When Noah awoke, he cursed Ham and his
descendants and blessed his other sons. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+6-9" rel="external" target="_blank">Genesis
6-9</a>]</p>
<p>Men lived at ease before the flood; a single harvest
provided for forty years, children were born after only a
few days instead of nine months and could walk and talk
immediately, and people could command the sun and moon.
This indolence led men astray, especially to the sins of
wantonness and rapacity. God determined to destroy the
sinners, but in mercy he instructed Noah to warn them of
the threat of a flood and to preach to them to mend their
ways. Noah did this for 120 years. God gave mankind a final
week of grace during which the sun reversed course, but the
wicked men did not repent; they only mocked Noah for
building the ark. Noah learned how to make the ark from a
book, given to Adam by the angel Raziel, which contained
all knowledge. This book was made of sapphires, and Noah
put it in a golden casket and, during the flood, used it to
tell day from night, for the sun and moon did not shine at
that time. The flood was caused by male waters from the sky
meeting the female waters from the ground. God made holes
in the sky for the waters to issue from by removing two
stars from the Pleiades. He later closed the hole by
borrowing two stars from the Bear. That is why the Bear
always runs after the Pleiades. The animals came to the ark
in such numbers that Noah could not take them all; he had
them sit by the door of the ark, and he took in the animals
which lay down at the door. 365 species of reptiles and 32
species of bird were taken. Since seven pairs of each kind
of clean animal were taken, the clean animals outnumbered
the unclean after the flood. One creatures, the <i>reem</i>
was so big it had to be tethered outside the ark and follow
behind. The giant Og, king of Bashan, was also too big and
escaped the flood sitting atop the ark. In addition to
Noah, his wife Naamah, and their sons and sons' wives,
Falsehood and Misfortune also took refuge on the ark.
Falsehood was initially turned away when he presented
himself without a mate, so he induced Misfortune to join
him and returned. When the flood began, the sinners
gathered around it and rushed the door, but the wild beasts
aboard the ark guarded the door and set upon them. Those
which escaped the beasts drowned in the flood. The ark, and
the animals in it, were tossed around on the waters for a
year, but Noah's greatest difficulty was feeding all the
animals, for he had to work day and night to feed both the
diurnal and nocturnal animals. When Noah once tarried in
feeding the lion, the lion gave him a blow which made him
lame for the rest of his life and prevented him from
serving as a priest. On the tenth day of the month of
Tammuz, Noah sent forth a raven, but the raven found a
corpse to devour and did not return. A week later Noah sent
out a dove, and on its third flight it returned with an
olive leaf plucked from the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem,
for the Holy Land had not suffered from the flood. Noah
wept at the devastation when he left the ark, and Shem
offered a thank-offering; Noah could not officiate due to
his encounter with the lion. [<a href="#Ginzberg">Ginzberg</a>, 
pp. 319-335; see also <a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 143-145]

</p>
<p>Aprocryphal scripture tells that Adam directed that his
body, together with gold, incense, and myrrh, should be
taken aboard the Ark and, after the flood, should be laid
in the middle of the earth. God would come from thence and
save mankind. [<a href="#Platt">Platt</a>, p. 66, 80 (2
Adam 8:9-18, 21:7-11)]</p>
<p>A woman "clothed with the sun" gave birth to a man child
who was taken up by God. The woman then lived in the
wilderness, where the Devil-dragon, cast down to earth,
persecuted her. At one time he cast a flood of water from
his mouth trying to wash her away, but the earth helped the
woman and swallowed the flood. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=rev+12" rel="external" target="_blank">Revelation

              <p><p>Allah sent Noah to warn the people to serve none but
Allah, but most of them would not listen. They challenged
Noah to make good his threats and mocked him when, under
Allah's inspiration, he built a ship. Allah told Noah not
to speak to Him on behalf of wrongdoers; they would be
drowned. In time, water gushed from underground and fell
from the sky. Noah loaded onto his ship pairs of all kinds,
his household, and those few who believed. One of Noah's
sons didn't believe and said he would seek safety in the
mountains. He was among the drowned. The ship sailed amid
great waves. Allah commanded the earth to swallow the water
and the sky to clear, and the ship came to rest on Al-Judi.
Noah complained to Allah for taking his son. Allah
admonished that the son was an evildoer and not of Noah's
household, and Noah prayed for forgiveness. Allah told Noah
to go with blessings on him and on some nations that will
arise from those with him. [<a href="http://islamicity.com/mosque/QURAN/11.htm#25" rel="external" target="_blank">Koran

drove a pair of all kinds of animals into trees and climbed
into a coconut tree with his family. As soon as the wicked
men ate the fish, water violently burst from the ground and
drowned everyone on it. As soon as the water reached the

              <p><p>The stars are the shining eyes of the gods. A man once
went into the sky and stole one of the eyes. (The Pelew
Islanders' money is made from it.) The gods were angry at
this and came to earth to punish the theft. They disguised
themselves as ordinary men and went door-to-door begging
for food and lodging. Only one old woman received them
kindly. They told her to make a bamboo raft ready and, on
the night of the next full moon, to lie down on it and
sleep. This she did. A great storm came; the sea rose,
flooded the islands, and destroyed everyone else. The
woman, fast asleep, drifted until her hair caught on a tree
on the top of Mount Armlimui. The gods came looking for her
again after the flood ebbed, but they found her dead. So
one of the women-folk from heaven entered the body and
restored it to life. The gods begat five children by the
old woman and then returned to heaven, as did the goddess
who restored her to life. The present inhabitants of the
islands are descendants of those five children. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 112-113; <a href="#Dixon">Dixon</a>, p. 257]</p>
<p>Before humans, one of the Kaliths (deities) named
Athndokl visited an unfriendly village and was killed by
its inhabitants. Seven friendly gods, who went searching
for him, were met with unkindness except from the woman
Milathk, who told them of the death. They resolved
vengeance by flooding the village, and suggested Milathk
save herself by preparing a raft tied to a tree by a rope.
The flood came and covered the village at the next full
moon. Milathk perished in the flood, but was recalled to
life by the oldest Obakad god. He wanted to make her
immortal but was stopped by another god, Tariit. Milathk
became the mother of mankind. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 132]</p></p>

              <p><p>A man and his wife, who was of supernatural origin,
could not satisfy the hunger of her father, named
Insatiable, who was also of supernatural origin. He had
grown so that he filled the entire council-house and had
eaten all the coconuts on the island. The husband, Kitimil,
saw one day that a mouse had been eating in his sugar-cane
field. His wife, Magigi, told him that it must have been
her father who had turned himself into a mouse. Kitimil
thought this was impossible, though, so he set a trap which
that night caught and killed the mouse. Magigi was
terrified that he had killed her father, and told him to
bring the mouse. Kitimil did so, and when he looked and saw
that the council-house was empty, he believed his wife. The
next morning, Magigi told Kitimil to take the mouse's blood
and four of its teeth and bury the body. When he had done
so, she said that a great flood will come and kill all the
people of Yap, so they must climb the highest mountain and
build a seven-story pile-dwelling there. They took some
leaves and oil and the blood and teeth of the mouse and
built the structure on the mountaintop. On the seventh day,
a great storm came, and the sea covered all of Yap. As the
water rose, Kitimil and Magigi climbed to higher stories of
their house. The deluge still rose when they reached the
top, so Magigi put some oil on a leaf and laid it on the
water, and immediately the storm ceased and the water
started abating. When the land was dry again, they found
that one other man had survived by lashing himself to an
outrigger anchored to a large stone. Magigi bore seven
children, who scattered across the land. [<a href="#Dixon">Dixon</a>, pp. 256-257]</p></p>

              <p><p>The great god Ndengei had a favorite bird, called
Turukawa, which would wake him every morning. His two
grandsons killed the bird and buried it to hide the crime.
Ndengei sent his messenger Utu to find the bird. The first
search proved fruitless, but a second search exposed the
grandsons' guilt. Rather than apologizing, they fled to the
mountains and took refuge with some carpenters, who built a
strong stockade to keep Ndengei at bay. In their fortress,
the rebels withstood Ndengei's armies for three months, but
then Ndengei caused the earth to be flooded with rain. The
rebels sat securely as the surrounding lands were
submerged, until the waters reached their walls. They
prayed to another god for direction, and they were brought
canoes (or taught how to make them) by Rokoro, the god of
carpenters, and his foreman Rokola. (By other accounts,
they were instructed to make floats out of the shaddock
fruit, or they floated in bowls.) They floated around
picking up other survivors. The receding tide left a total
of eight survivors on the island of Mbengha. Two tribes
were destroyed completely--one consisting entirely of women
and the other with tails like dogs. The natives of Mbengha
claim to rank highest of all the Fijians. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 131; <a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 106]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>The rain god Aokeu ("Red Circle" for the red clay he
washes around the island), who was lowly born of the
drippings from stalactites, disputed with the ocean god Ake
to see which was more powerful. Ake summoned help from the
wind god Raka and his twin children Tikokura, who is seen
in the line of curling billows which break over reefs, and
Tane-ere-tue, who manifests in storm waves. They attacked
the coast, reaching the height of the Makatea, a raised
barrier reef plateau surrounding the island, hundreds of
feet high. Proof of their deeds may be seen in seashells
embedded in high rocks. Meanwhile, Aokeu caused five days
and nights of rain, washing the red clay and small stones
into the ocean and carving deep valleys. Rangi, the
people's first chief, had been forewarned and led his
people to Rangimotia, the central peak. Soon water covered
everything except a long narrow strip of soil, and the tide
continued rising. Rangi waded through water up to his chin
to reach the temple of the supreme god Rongo, and appealed
to him. Rongo looked at the war of the waters and cried
"Enough!" The sea subsided and the rain stopped, leaving
the island with its present landscape. Aokeu was judged the
victor, because the sea had been stopped by the rocky
heights, but but the rains flowed far into the ocean,
carrying red clay to mark their progress. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 246-248; <a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 168]</p></p>

              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>A chief named Taoiau, angered at his people for not
bringing him the sacred turtle, roused all the sea gods on
whose good will the islands depend. One, who sleeps at the
bottom of the sea, was roused to anger by the king's prayer
and stood straight up. A hurricane burst forth, and the sea
swept over the island of Rakaanga. A few inhabitants
survived by taking refuge on a mound. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 249]</p></p>

              <p>Toamarama</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Shortly after the peopling of the world, a fisherman
carelessly let his hooks get entangled in the hair of the
sea god Ruahatu, who was reposing among the coral, and
disturbed the god's rest when wrenching them out. The angry
god surfaced, upbraided the fisherman, and threatened to
destroy the land in revenge. The fisherman prostrated
himself and apologized profusely. Moved by his penitence,
Ruahatu told him to go with his wife and child to
Toamarama, a small low island (not more than two feet above
sea level) in a lagoon on the east side of Raiatea. This he
did, taking also some domesticated animals. As the sun set,
the ocean waters began to rise and continued rising all
night. The other inhabitants fled to the mountains, but at
last even these were covered, and everyone on Raiatea
perished. When the waters receded, the fisherman and his
family returned to the mainland and became progenitors of
its present inhabitants. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp.

              <p><strong>Tahiti, French Polynesia, Oceania</strong></p>
              <p>Mount Pita-hiti</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Tahiti was destroyed by the sea. Even the trees and
stones were carried away by the wind. But two people were
saved. The wife took up her young chicken, her young dog,
and her kitten, and the husband took up his young pig. The
husband said they should escape to Mount Orofena, but the
wife said (correctly) that the flood would reach even
there, and they should go to Mount Pita-hiti instead, which
they did. They watched ten nights till the sea ebbed. The
land, though, remained without produce, and the fish in the
rock crevices were putrid. When the wind died away, stones
and trees began to fall from the heavens, where the winds
had carried them. To escape this new danger, the couple dug
a hole, lined it with grass, and covered it over with
stones and earth. They crept inside and listened to the
terrible crash of the falling stones. By and by, the
falling stones stopped, but to be safe they waited another
night before coming out. The land they found was desolated.
The woman brought forth two children, a son and a daughter,
but grieved about the lack of food. Again the mother
brought forth, but still there was no food. Then in three
days all the trees bore fruit. All people are descended
from that couple. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp.

<p>The Supreme God was angry and dragged the earth through
the sea. By a happy chance, the island of Tahiti broke off
and was preserved. [<a href="#HMiller">H. Miller</a>, p.

              <p><strong>Hawaii, United States, Oceania</strong></p>
              <p>Mauna Kea</p>
              <p><b>Original story:</b></p>
              <p><p>Lalohona, a woman from the depths of the sea, was
enticed ashore by Konikonia with a series of images. She
warned him that her parents, Kahinalii and
Hinakaalualumoana, would cause the ocean to flood the land
so that her brothers, the <i>pao'o</i> fish, may search for
her. At her suggestion, they fled to the mountains and
built their home in the tops of the tallest trees. After
ten days, Kahinalii sent the ocean; it rose and overwhelmed
the land. The people fled to the mountains, and the flood
covered the mountains; they climbed the trees, and the
flood rose above the trees and drowned them all. But the
waters began to subside just as they reached the door of
Konikonia's house. When the waters retreated, he and his
people returned to their land. This flood is called
kai-a-ka-hina-lii. [<a href="#Barrere">Barrère</a>,
p. 23]</p>
<p>All the land was once overflowed by the sea, except for
the peak of Mauna Kea, where two humans survived. The event
is called <i>kai a Kahinarii</i> (sea of Kahinarii). There
was no ship involved. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
110; Barrère, p. 22]</p>
<p>In the earliest times in Hawaii, there was no sea, nor
even fresh water. Pele came to Hawaii because she was
displeased over her husband having been enticed from her.
Her parents gave her the sea so she could bring her canoes.
At Kanaloa she poured the sea from her head. It rose until
it covered the high ground, leaving only a few mountains
not entirely submerged. She later caused it to recede to
what we see today. This sea was named after the mother of
Pele, Kahinalii, because the sea belonged to her; Pele
simply brought it. [<a href="#Barrere">Barrère</a>,
pp. 23-24]</p>
<p>The people had turned to evil, so Kane punished their
sin with a flood. Nu'u and his company were saved by
entering into the Great-Canoe, a large canoe roofed over
like a house, which had been given them by Kane. The canoe
contained a number of things, and Nu'u ruled over the whole
like a chief. After the flood, these people repopulated the
islands. The waters came up as a wicked brother-in-law of
Nu'u was indulging himself in pleasure. He ran to enter the
ark, but his calls were unheard by those inside. He prayed
to the god Lono in the name of his sister but did not
escape. He became angry at the first pair of people who had
brought this trouble by bringing evil into the world, and
he prayed to Lono that the whole earth be destroyed and
that the first pair of people be brought back to life to
witness the trouble they caused. [<a href="#Barrere">Barrère</a>, pp. 19-21]</p>
<p>Nuu was of the thirteenth generation from the first man.
The gods commanded Nuu to build an ark and carry on it his
wife, three sons, and males and females of all breathing
things. Waters came and covered the earth. They subsided to
leave the ark on a mountain overlooking a beautiful valley.
The gods entered the ark and told Nuu to go forth with all
the life it carried. In gratitude for his deliverance, Nuu
offered a sacrifice of pig, coconuts, and awa to the moon,
which he thought was the god Kane. Kane descended on a
rainbow to reproach Nuu for his mistake but left the
rainbow as a perpetual sign of his forgiveness. [<a href="#Kalakaua">Kalakaua</a>, p. 37; <a href="#Barrere">Barrère</a>, pp. 21-22]</p>
<p>A high chief had two boys killed for playing with his
drums. Their father Kamalo sought the help of the shark god
Kauhuhu to get revenge. Kauhuhu told the man to build a
special fence around his place and to collect 400 black
pigs, 400 red fish, and 400 white chickens. Months later,
Kauhuhu came in the form of a cloud. He caused a great
storm which washed everyone on the hillside, except Kamalo
and his people, into the harbor, where sharks devoured
them. [<a href="#Westervelt">Westervelt</a>, pp.
