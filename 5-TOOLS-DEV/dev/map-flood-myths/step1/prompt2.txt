This is a list of locations, sometimes historical/ancient, sometimes just referring to a specific culture or religion. Extra details for a certain location are sometimes provided in parentheses. Convert each entry to a modern present-day existing location, in either of 2 formats:
- city, country, continent (this is the preferred option)
- country, continent (use this when nothing more than a country is specified)

All results should be present day locations, not ancient ones. Ancient locations, religions, and cultures should be converted to present day locations. If there is no such location provided, you should infer a location of a present day city/country that is closest to the provided location.

Return in an unordered list markdown code block. Here are the (potentially ancient) locations/regions/cultures you should convert to present-day existing locations, one-for-one (the number of output results should be exactly the same as the number of input entries):
