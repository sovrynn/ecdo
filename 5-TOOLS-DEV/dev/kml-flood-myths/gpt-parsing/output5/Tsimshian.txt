Yes, the story mentions that a few people escaped to the tops of high mountains during the flood. However, specific names of those mountains are not provided. It also indicates that more people were saved in canoes and that they settled in various spots after the waters went down. 

Since there are references to survival on high mountains, I cannot return "0".
