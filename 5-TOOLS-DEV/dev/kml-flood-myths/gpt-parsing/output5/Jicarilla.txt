The story mentions four mountains where people were told to go to avoid the flood: Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and another unnamed mountain. Additionally, it refers to the Superstition Mountains in Arizona, where a chief led his warriors. Therefore, there is land that did not get flooded, namely these mountains mentioned.

There is also mention of people surviving in the mountains, specifically the 24 people who remained on the mountain tops and the chief and his warriors in the Superstition Mountains.

Thus, the mountains that remained above the water during the flood are Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and the unnamed mountain, along with the Superstition Mountains.

Survivors were present in the mountains but no mention of someone specifically surviving in a cave. 

In summary, yes, there was land that didn't get flooded, and here are the names: Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and the Superstition Mountains.
