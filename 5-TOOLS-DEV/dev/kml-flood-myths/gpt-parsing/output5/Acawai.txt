Yes, there were lands that did not get flooded in the story. Sigu led the birds and climbing animals to tall cocorite trees on the highest hill. Additionally, he led the other animals to a cave where its entrance was covered with wax. Thus, the names of the land that did not get flooded include the highest hill (where the cocorite trees are) and the cave where some animals survived.
