The story mentions that the good people were saved in a dugout boat, and specifically notes that the canoe can still be seen on the east side of Toppenish Ridge. This implies that Toppenish Ridge was a place that did not get flooded and served as a refuge for the good people. 

Therefore, there was indeed land that did not get flooded, and the name of that land is **Toppenish Ridge**.
