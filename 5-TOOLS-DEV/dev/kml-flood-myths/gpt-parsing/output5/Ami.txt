Ragasan mountain and Mount Kaburugan are mentioned as places that were not flooded during the deluge. The story details that the children Sura and Nakao floated to safety on Ragasan mountain, while another brother and sister climbed Mount Kaburugan after escaping the flood. 

Additionally, there is a mention of the sister who turned into a rock during the flood event, but there is no explicit mention of anyone surviving in a cave. 

Thus, the two pieces of land that did not flood are:
- Ragasan mountain
- Mount Kaburugan
