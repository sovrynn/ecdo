The story mentions that Lip-long survived the flood on a raft with a cow, and later he crawled into the belly of the cow to escape the fire sent by the storm god. The flood also affected the earth, but there is no specific mention of any other land or mountain that remained unscathed or above water where individuals took refuge.

There is also mention of a giant gourd shell which was used by righteous individuals to survive the flood. The mountain itself does not serve as a refuge for survivors, and while caves were noted as places for snakes and tigers to escape the storm god's wrath, no human survivors were said to have occupied caves or mountaintops above the water's level.

Given the details in the story, the answer is 0.
