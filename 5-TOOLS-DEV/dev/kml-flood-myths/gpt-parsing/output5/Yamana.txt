The story mentions that five mountaintops stayed above the floodwater. These mountains are:

1. Usláka
2. Wémarwaia
3. Auwáratuléra
4. Welalánux
5. Piatuléra

Additionally, it states that a few people survived on these mountaintops. Therefore, there was land that didn't get flooded. 

As for survival in a cave, the excerpt does not mention anyone surviving in a cave. 

So, the answer regarding land that didn't get flooded is the names of the five mountaintops:

Usláka, Wémarwaia, Auwáratuléra, Welalánux, Piatuléra.
