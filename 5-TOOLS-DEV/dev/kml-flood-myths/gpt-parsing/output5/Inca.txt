In the flood story, it is mentioned that some priests heeded a warning and went to live as hermits in a temple on a hill, indicating that they survived the flood. However, the specific name of the hill or mountain is not provided in the text. Therefore, it can be concluded that there were lands that did not get flooded, and at least some people (the priests) survived by staying above the water.

The key points are:
- Priests survived on a hill (not specifically named).
- No mention of survival in a cave.

Given this, I will return the number of the surviving group:

1. The priests survived on a hill but no specific name is given.

Thus, the response is: 

1
