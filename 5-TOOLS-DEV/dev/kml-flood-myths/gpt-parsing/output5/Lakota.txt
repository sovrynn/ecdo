In the flood story, it is mentioned that only a few people escaped to the highest mountain, which was the only place not covered by water. However, no specific name for this mountain is provided. Additionally, there is mention of a girl who survived in a tree on the highest pinnacle, but there are no details about a cave or any other specific land that remained above water.

Therefore, since the text does reference a "highest mountain" where some people found refuge, I cannot conclude that there was entirely no land that didnâ€™t get flooded, and I also do not have specific names.

The answer is: 0
