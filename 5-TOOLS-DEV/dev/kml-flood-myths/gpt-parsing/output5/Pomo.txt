In the flood story you provided, there are mentions of land that did not get flooded. Specifically, the story refers to a "very high mountain" where the three children went to escape the flood, as well as Mt. Kanaktai, which Gopher climbed to avoid the floodwaters. Therefore, the names of lands that didn't get flooded are:

1. The very high mountain (unspecified name)
2. Mt. Kanaktai

Additionally, it is noted that Gopher survived by climbing to the top of Mt. Kanaktai. 

Since there are mentions of both lands that remained above water and a survivor in a mountain, I provide the following response:

Very high mountain, Mt. Kanaktai.
