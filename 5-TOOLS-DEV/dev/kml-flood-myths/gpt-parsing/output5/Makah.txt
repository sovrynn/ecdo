In the flood story you provided, it mentions that "the rising waters were very warm" and that they "covered all but the mountain tops." This indicates that there were indeed areas of higher land that remained above the floodwaters. However, the story does not specify the names of any particular mountains or lands where people survived. 

Since it does not directly mention anyone surviving specifically on a mountain or in a cave, I will return the character you requested.
