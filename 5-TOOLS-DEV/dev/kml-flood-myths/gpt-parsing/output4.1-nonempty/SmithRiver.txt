The highest peak is mentioned as the place where the surviving pair found safety, but no specific name for this land or mountain is provided in the excerpt. Therefore, there is land that did not get flooded, but its name is not specified. 

Additionally, the mention of surviving in a cave is not present in the story.

Based on these points, I will return the character:
