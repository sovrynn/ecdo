The hill of Parbus (today called Maatale) is mentioned as a land that did not get flooded, as well as "other mountains" where a few other people were saved. Additionally, it is noted that Yaitowi and others survived the flood. Thus, the specific lands/mountains that remained above the water include the hill of Parbus/Maatale and other unnamed mountains. There is no mention of anyone surviving in a cave. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Parbus (Maatale) and other mountains.
