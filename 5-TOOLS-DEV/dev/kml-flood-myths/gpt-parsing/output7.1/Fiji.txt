Yes, during the flood story, the grandsons fled to the mountains where they took refuge with some carpenters. They built a strong stockade in the mountains to withstand the flood. Although the name of the exact mountain is not provided, it is clear that there was land—specifically, the mountains—where they sought safety from the floodwaters. Eventually, they were able to escape using canoes or by floating on shaddock fruits or bowls. Later, they ended up as survivors on the island of Mbengha. 

So, to summarize: 
1. There was land that did not get flooded—the mountains where the grandsons took refuge.
2. They survived by going to the mountains.

The response is not "0" because there is a mention of survival in the mountains. 

**Mountains (land):** The mountains (unspecified). 
**Island:** Mbengha (where they ultimately ended up).
