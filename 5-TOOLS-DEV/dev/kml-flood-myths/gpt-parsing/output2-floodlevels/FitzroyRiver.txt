The excerpt does not provide a specific flood level in terms of mountaintops or exact heights reached by the flood. It only mentions the location where the Ark came to rest, which is the flood plain of Djilinbadu, but does not indicate how high the floodwaters rose relative to any specific geographical features. 

Therefore, the answer is: nothing.
