The excerpt mentions that when the man embarked in the canoe, "the water rose till no land was visible anywhere," indicating that the flood covered all land. However, it does not specify any exact locations, mountaintops, or specific flood levels. Therefore, there are no specific names of mountaintops or heights reached by the flood mentioned in the text.

Thus, the response is: nothing.
