The excerpt mentions that the flood "rose above the highest mountains" but does not specify exact mountaintops or names of mountains. It also states that the water left "seashells on the Altiplano at elevations of 3660 m" and that the flood eventually covered the ruined city, leading to the creation of Lake Titicaca. However, no specific mountain peaks or other exact flood levels are given. 

Therefore, the answer is: nothing.
