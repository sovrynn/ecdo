The exact location that the flood went up to is described as "the height of the Makatea, a raised barrier reef plateau surrounding the island, hundreds of feet high." Additionally, Rangi waded through water up to his chin. Therefore, the flood reached at least up to the height of the Makatea and to Rangi's chin level.
