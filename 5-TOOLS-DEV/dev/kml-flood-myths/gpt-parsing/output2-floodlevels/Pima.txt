The excerpt describes a flood that washed over the Gila valley, but it does not provide specific names of mountaintops or exact locations where the flood reached. Instead, it mentions that Szeukha landed on a mountain above the Salt River and refers to a mountain near the Colorado River, but no specific names are given for these mountain tops or their locations in relation to the flood level. 

Therefore, based on the excerpt provided, there are no specific flood levels given regarding mountaintops. I will return nothing.
