The excerpt does not specify the exact mountaintops or flood levels. It mentions that the flood "spread over Queen Katife's country (drowning her) and several cities in Africa" and refers to "ship moorings high above the coast of the Black Sea," but it does not provide specific locations like the names of mountaintops or the tops of mountains. 

Therefore, the answer is: nothing.
