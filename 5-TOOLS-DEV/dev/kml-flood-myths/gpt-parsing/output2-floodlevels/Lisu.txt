The excerpt mentions that the brother and sister "found they had landed atop a mountain" after the flood had receded. However, it does not specify the name of the mountain or any particular mountaintops that the flood reached. Therefore, there is no exact location identified in the text regarding the specific flood level. 

Nothing.
