The excerpt states that "the highest mountains were covered" by the flood, but does not provide specific names of those mountains or their tops. There is a mention of the "Mount of Olives in Jerusalem" as a location that did not suffer from the flood, but it does not specify a flood level there. Therefore, there are no specified flood levels in terms of mountaintops or specific locations given in this excerpt. 

Since there is no specific flood level mentioned, the return is: **nothing**.
