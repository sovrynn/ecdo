The specific locations that the flood went up to mentioned in the excerpt are:

1. Mount Parnassus (where Deucalion and his wife landed)
2. Mount Othrys (where another version states Deucalion's ark landed)
3. A peak, probably Phouka, in Argolis (another account of Deucalion's landing)
4. Mount Gerania (where Megarus escaped the flood)

These mountaintops are noted as the highest places where people escaped the flood.
