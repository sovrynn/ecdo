The flood went up to the "top boughs of a fir tree on the top of one tall mountain" and stopped just "as they reached his mouth" (referring to Menaboshu). Additionally, it is mentioned that the waters rose "to cover even the highest mountains," but no specific mountaintops are named. Therefore, the answers are:

- "the top boughs of a fir tree on the top of one tall mountain"
- "the highest mountains" (but no specific names provided)

If you are looking for specific names of mountaintops, there are none in the provided excerpt.
