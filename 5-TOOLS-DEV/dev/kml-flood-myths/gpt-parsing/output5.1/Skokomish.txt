The flood story mentions that the flood covered the Olympic Mountains, indicating that this land was affected by the flooding. However, it does not specify anyone surviving on a mountaintop or in a cave. The mention of Takhoma (Mount Rainier) suggests that it was a higher land where some good people and animals climbed down after the floodwaters receded, but it does not indicate that anyone survived on it during the flood itself.

Therefore, since there is no specific mention of someone surviving on a mountaintop or other land above the water, I will return:
