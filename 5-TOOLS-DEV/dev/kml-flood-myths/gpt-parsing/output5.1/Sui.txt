Yes, there was land that didn't get flooded. The survivors, including Grandpa Xiang, his wife Ya, and their grandchildren, lived on Sun Mountain. They managed to survive by staying in their wooden houses that floated on the floodwaters. When the golden dragon shook his body, the upper half of Sun Mountain erupted into the sky, allowing them to stay above the water. The story indicates that they settled there peacefully after the flood. 

Thus, the name of the land from which they survived is **Sun Mountain**.
