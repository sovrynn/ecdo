Based on the flood story provided, it is mentioned that people retreated to the "highest peaks" during the flood. However, the story does not specify any particular names of the mountains or any land that remained above the floodwaters. Since it does indicate that people survived by going to higher ground but does not give specific names or details of the locations, I will return the character.
