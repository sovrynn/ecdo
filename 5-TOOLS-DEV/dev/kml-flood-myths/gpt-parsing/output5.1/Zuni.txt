The story describes that the Zunis took refuge on a nearby tableland, which implies that this land was above the floodwaters initially. However, it also states that the flood rose nearly to the top of the tableland, creating a perilous situation for the people. 

Ultimately, the mention of the youth and maiden being thrown into the flood as a sacrifice indicates that the situation was desperate, but the presence of the tableland suggests that it was a location of refuge for the people before the floodwaters came very close.

Based on the information given, there is a mention of the nearby tableland serving as land that did not get completely flooded, as the people were able to take refuge there, at least temporarily. However, there is no indication of anyone surviving by reaching a mountaintop or staying above the water in a cave. The transformation of the two sacrificed individuals into stone pinnacles may symbolize the events but does not state that they survived in a traditional sense.

Given this interpretation:

1. The tableland provided temporary refuge above the floodwaters.
2. There's no mention of individuals surviving on a mountaintop or a cave.

Since there was technically land that didn't get flooded completely, I will offer a single character response based on the criteria presented.
