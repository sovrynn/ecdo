Menaboshu, Nenebojo, and Wenebojo all survived on mountain tops or high ground during the floods they faced. Specifically:

- Menaboshu climbed to the top boughs of a fir tree on the top of a tall mountain.
- Nenebojo was directed to a tall pine tree on a mountain where he built a raft.
- Wenebojo climbed a tall pine tree on a bluff that stretched higher to save him from the flood.

So there are mountains mentioned where survivors took refuge:

1. A tall mountain (specific name not provided) where Menaboshu stayed.
2. A tall pine tree on a mountain where Nenebojo took refuge.
3. A bluff with a tall pine tree (specific name not provided) where Wenebojo climbed.

Therefore, the answer is:
