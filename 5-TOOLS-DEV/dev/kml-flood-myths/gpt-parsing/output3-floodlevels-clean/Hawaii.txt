The flood covered the mountains and rose above the trees, drowning them all, reaching just as high as the door of Konikonia's house. Additionally, it is noted that all the land was overflowed by the sea, except for the peak of Mauna Kea, where two humans survived. Therefore, the specific locations mentioned are:

- The peak of Mauna Kea.
- The tops of the tallest trees.
- The door of Konikonia's house.

So the exact locations reached by the flood are:

- Mauna Kea
- The tops of the tallest trees
- The door of Konikonia's house

However, if you require a singular most specific location that the flood reached, it would be Mauna Kea.
