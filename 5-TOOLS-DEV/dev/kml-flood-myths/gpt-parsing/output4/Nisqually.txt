Yes, there was land that didn't get flooded. The story mentions that one woman and one dog survived atop Tacobud (Mt. Rainier). 

Additionally, it can be inferred that the woman and the dog survived in a place that was not flooded, which can be interpreted as a cave, although it's not explicitly stated in the excerpt. 

So the answer is:
Tacobud (Mt. Rainier)
