The flood story indicates that the only land that remained above the water were the summits of some of the highest mountains. However, specific names of such mountains or land are not provided in the excerpt. It also mentions that three men escaped to the Nzukeski Mountains. Thus, a specific location where there was land that didnâ€™t get flooded is the Nzukeski Mountains. 

Coyote survived by turning himself into a piece of wood and floating, but there is no mention of someone surviving in a cave.

In summary, the Nzukeski Mountains are mentioned as land that was not flooded, and Coyote survived by floating, not in a cave.

So, the answer is: Nzukeski Mountains
