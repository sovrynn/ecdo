The flood story indicates that the mountain Noesake emerged from the waters, and it mentions that other mountains also emerged. Therefore, there was land that did not get flooded, specifically the mountain Noesake. Additionally, no mention is made of survival in a cave.

So the names of the land/mountains that did not get flooded would include:

1. Noesake

Since other mountains are mentioned but not named, only Noesake is explicitly referenced in this excerpt. 

The answer is:

Noesake
