The story indicates that the man's box came to rest on a mountain near Santa Cantarina, which implies that this mountain was not flooded. Additionally, it mentions that the man lived with the bitch in a cave, suggesting that there was at least some land (the cave) that was not submerged. Therefore, the mountain that remained above water is Santa Cantarina. 

The answer is: Santa Cantarina.
