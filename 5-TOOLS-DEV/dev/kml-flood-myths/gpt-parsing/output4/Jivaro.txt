The story indicates that some land did not get flooded, specifically referencing "the top of a palm tree on the highest mountain" to which one brother fled. Additionally, it mentions that a man and woman took refuge in "a cave on a high mountain" during the flood. 

Thus, the high mountain and the palm tree on it, along with the cave, are identified as places that remained above the floodwaters. 

In summary:
- The land that didn't get flooded includes:
  - The highest mountain (with a palm tree)
  - A high mountain (where the cave was located)
  
There were survivors in a cave as well.
