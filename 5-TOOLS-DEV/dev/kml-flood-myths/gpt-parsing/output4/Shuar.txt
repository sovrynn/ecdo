The story indicates that the hunter and one of his daughters escaped to a mountaintop, which implies that there was land that did not get flooded. However, the specific name of that mountaintop is not provided in the excerpt. Therefore, I can confirm that there was land that didn't get flooded, but no specific names are mentioned.

As for survival in a cave, there is no indication of anyone surviving in a cave in the story.

So, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- There was land that didn't get flooded (a mountaintop).
- Specific names of such land/mountains were not provided.

Since the excerpt does not provide specific names, I will return:
