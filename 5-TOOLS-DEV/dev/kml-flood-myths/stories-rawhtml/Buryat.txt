<p>The god Burkhan advised a man to build a great ship, and
the man worked on it in the forest for many long days,
keeping his intention secret from his wife by telling her
he was chopping wood. The devil, Shitkur, told the wife
that her husband was building a boat and that it would be
ready soon. He further told her to refuse to board and,
when her husband strikes her in anger, to say, "Why do you
strike me, Shitkur?" Because the woman followed this
advise, the devil was able to accompany her when she
boarded the boat. With the help of Burkhan, the man
gathered specimens of all animals except Argalan-Zan, the
Prince of animals (some say it was a mammoth), which
considered itself too large to drown. The flood destroyed
all animals left on earth, including the Prince of animals,
whose bones can still be found. Once on the boat, the devil
changed himself into a mouse and began gnawing holes in the
hull, until Burkhan created a cat to catch it. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, pp. 361-362]</p>
