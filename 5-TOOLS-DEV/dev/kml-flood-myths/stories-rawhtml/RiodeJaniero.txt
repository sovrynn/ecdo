<p>Two twin sons of a great wizard, one good and the other
evil, were always arguing. One day the angered good brother
stamped so hard that the earth opened and water gushed out,
shooting as high as the clouds. The water covered the whole
world. The good brother and his wife climbed a
<i>pindona</i> tree, and the evil brother and his wife
climbed a <i>geniper</i> tree until the waters receded. (In
another account, they survived in canoes.) From these
couples descended the Tupinambas and Tominus, two tribes
which don't get along well. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 175; <a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 124-125]</p>
