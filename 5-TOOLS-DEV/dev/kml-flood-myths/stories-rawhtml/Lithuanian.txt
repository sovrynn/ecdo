<p>From his heavenly window, the supreme god Pramzimas saw
nothing but war and injustice among mankind. He sent two
giants, Wandu and Wejas (water and wind), to destroy earth.
After twenty days and nights, little was left. Pramzimas
looked to see the progress. He happened to be eating nuts
at the time, and he threw down the shells. One happened to
land on the peak of the tallest mountain, where some people
and animals had sought refuge. Everybody climbed in and
survived the flood floating in the nutshell. God's wrath
abated, he ordered the wind and water to abate. The people
dispersed, except for one elderly couple who stayed where
they landed. To comfort them, God sent the rainbow and
advised them to jump over the bones of the earth nine
times. They did so, and up sprang nine other couples, from
which the nine Lithuanian tribes descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 93]</p>
