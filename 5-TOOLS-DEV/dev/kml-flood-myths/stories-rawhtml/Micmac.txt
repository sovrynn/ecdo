<p>Kuloscap (Glooscap) defeated the cruel Ice Giant
magicians at various contests. Then he stomped on the
ground, and foaming water rushed down from the mountains.
He sang a song which changed how everyone looks, and the
Ice Giants became large fish and were washed to sea. Those
fish carry markings like the wampum collars of the
magicians. [<a href="#Norman">Norman</a>, p. 115; <a href="#Leland">Leland</a>, p. 126]</p>
