<p>A flood covered the whole world except for the summit of
Mount Tauga. When the waves threatened to cover even that,
the rockface cracked and the diamond-studded head of
Radaulo, king of snakes, emerged. His fiery tongue licked
out to taste the waves, and the water, hissing, retreated.
Radaulo slowly uncoiled and pursued the water all the way
back to the ocean bed. [<a href="#Eliot">Eliot</a>, p.
