<p>Lohero and his brother were angry with their neighbors,

flood came forth, and the people had to retreat to the
highest peaks until the sea receded. Some people descended,
and others made their homes on the ridges. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 105; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp. 130-131]</p>
