<p>The ocean was once enclosed in a small pot kept by a man
and his wife under the roof of their hut to fill their
larger pots. The man told his daughter-in-law never to
touch it because it contained their sacred ancestors. But
she grew curious and touched it. It shattered, and the
resulting flood drowned everything. [<a href="#Kahler">Kahler-Meyer</a>, pp. 253-254]</p>
