<p>When the Squamish saw the great flood coming, they held
a council and decided to make a giant canoe. The men worked
day and night to make this canoe, the biggest ever, and the
women made a long rope of oiled cedar fibers with which
they tied the canoe to a giant rock. They put every baby
into the canoe, with food and water. They selected the
bravest young man and the mother of the youngest baby to go
as their guardians. No one cried as the waters rose and
drowned everyone else. After several days, the man saw a
speck far to the south. By the next day, he could see that
it was a mountain top, Mount Baker. He cut the rope and
paddled to it, and made a new home there. The outline of
the canoe can still be seen halfway up the slope of Mount
Baker. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, pp. 42-43]</p>
