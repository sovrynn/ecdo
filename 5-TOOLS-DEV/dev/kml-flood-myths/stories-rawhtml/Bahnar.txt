<p>A kite once quarrelled with the crab and pecked a hole
in its skull (which can still be seen today). In revenge,
the crab caused the sea and rivers to swell until the
waters reached the sky. The only survivors were a brother
and sister who took a pair of all kinds of animals with
them in a huge chest. They floated for seven days and
nights. Then the brother heard a cock crowing outside, sent
by the spirits to signal that the flood had abated. All
disembarked, birds first, then the animals, then the two
people. The brother and sister did not know how they would
live, for they had eaten all the rice that was stored in
the chest. However, a black ant brought two grains of rice.
The brother planted them, and the plain was covered with a
rice crop the next morning. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>,
