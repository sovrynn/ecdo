<p>A flood once covered everything but the summit of Mount
Wawom Pebato (seashells on the hills are evidence). Only a
pregnant woman and a pregnant mouse escaped in a pig's
trough, paddling with a pot-ladle. After the waters had
descended, the woman saw a sheaf of rice hanging from an
uprooted tree which drifted ashore where she was standing.
The mouse got it down for her, but demanded in recompense
that mice should thereafter have the right to eat part of
the harvest. The woman gave birth to a son, took him for
her husband, and by him had a son and daughter who became
mankind's ancestors. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
