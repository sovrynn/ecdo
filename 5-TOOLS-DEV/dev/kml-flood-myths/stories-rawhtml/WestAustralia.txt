<p>Long ago, two races, one white and one black, lived on
opposite shores of a great river. At first they were on
friendly terms, intermarrying, feasting together, etc. But
the whites were more powerful and had better spears and
boomerangs, so they came to feel superior and broke off
relations. Some time later, it rained for several months.
The river overflowed and forced the blacks to retreat into
the hinterland. When the rains stopped and the waters
receded, the blacks returned, to find that their neighbors
had vanished under a wide sea. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, p. 166]</p>
