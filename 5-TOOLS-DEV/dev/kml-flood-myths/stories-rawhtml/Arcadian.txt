<p>Dardanus, first king of Arcadia, was driven from his
land by a great flood which submerged the lowlands,
rendering them unfit for cultivation. The people retreated
to the mountains, but they soon decided that the land left
was not enough to support them all. Some stayed with Dimas,
son of Dardanus, as their king; Dardanus led the rest to
the island of Samothrace. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p.
