<p>As a great worldwide flood receded, the mountain Noesake
emerged with its sides clothed with trees whose leaves were
shaped like female genitalia. Only three people survived on
the top of the mountain. The sea-eagle brought tidings of
other mountains emerging from the waters, and the people
went thither. By means of the remarkable leaves, they
repopulated the world. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
