<p>Long ago, when men had become evil, the Strong Serpent
<i>Maskanako</i> came. He was the foe of people, and they
became embroiled, hating and fighting each other. The small
men (<i>Mattapewi</i>) fought with <i>Nihanlowit</i>,
keeper of the dead. The Strong Serpent resolved to destroy
all men, and the Black Serpent brought the snake-water
rushing, spreading everywhere, destroying everything. Then
the waters ran off, and the great evil went away by the
path of the cave. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp.
