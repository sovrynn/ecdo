<p>Quilla, the moon, had sex with his bird sister, Jilucu.
From this union came the stars, as people. Quilla always
came unseen at night. One night Jilucu smeared genipa juice
on his face, telling him it would make him feel fresh. By
morning the juice turned dark, and Jilucu saw that her
lover was the moon. The stars also knew from the moon's
spotted face that they were descended from an incestuous
relationship. They all cried, and their crying produced
rain, earthquake, and flood. Volcanoes erupted, new hills
formed, rivers swelled; the earth people were swept
eastward by a great river into the sea. From this river
came the sun, who began his regular course and brought an
orderly axis to the world. The moon and stars lost much of
their power because of the incestuous relationship, making
night lose most of its light. The people were separated
from one another and had to work their way westward, having
many adventures along the way. [<a href="#Whitten">Whitten</a>, pp. 51-52]</p>
