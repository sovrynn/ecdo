<p>Léxuwakipa, the rusty brown spectacled ibis, felt
offended by the people, so she let it snow so much that ice
came to cover the entire earth. This happened at the time
of Yáiaasága, when men seized power from the
women. When the ice melted, it rapidly flooded all the
earth. People hurried to their canoes, but many didn't make
it, and more perished when they couldn't find sheltered
places. Some people reached the five mountaintops which
stayed above the flood. These mountains were Usláka,
Wémarwaia, Auwáratuléra,
Welalánux, and Piatuléra. The water stayed at
its high mark for two days and then rapidly lowered. Signs
of the floodwaters still show up on those mountains. The
few families which survived rebuilt their huts on the
shore. Men have ruled women since then. [<a href="#Wilbert">Wilbert</a>, pp. 27-28]</p>
<p>The moon-woman Hánuxa caused the flood because
she was full of hatred against the people, especially the
men, who had taken over the women's secret <i>kina</i>
ceremony and made it their own. A few people survived on
five mountaintops. [<a href="#Wilbert">Wilbert</a>, p.

<p>The sun sank into the sea, causing its waters to rise
tumultuously and to cover all the earth except the summit
of a single mountain. A few people survived there. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 128]</p>
