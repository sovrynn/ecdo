The Druids represented the world as an enormous animal issuing out of the abyss from the abode of an evil spirit. In common with most nations and religions, they had their Deluge tradition, but they represented the event as occuring in a lake called Llyn Llion, the waters of which burst forth and overwhelmed the face of the whole world. One vessel only escaped the catastrophe, and in this were a man and a woman and certain of the animal species. By these Britain was re-peopled with human beings and animals.
