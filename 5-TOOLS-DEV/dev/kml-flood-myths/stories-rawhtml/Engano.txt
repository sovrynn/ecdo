<p>The tide rose so high it overflowed the island. All
drowned except one woman, who survived through the
fortunate chance that her hair got caught in a thorny tree
as she drifted along on the tide. When the flood sank, she
came down from the tree and found herself alone. Hungry,
she searched for food and finding none inland, went to the
beach hoping to catch a fish. She found a fish, but it hid
in one of the corpses left by the flood. She picked up
stone and hit the corpse, but the fish escaped and headed
inland. She followed, but soon met a living man. The man
told her that he had to returned to life as a consequence
of somebody knocking on his dead body. The woman told him
her story, and they returned to the beach and restored the
population by knocking on the drowned people. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 100-101]</p>
