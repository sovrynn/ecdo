<p>A flood once covered all but the summits of some of the
highest mountains. Its cause isn't certain, but it may have
been made the the three brothers Qoaqlqal, who travelled
the country transforming things until they themselves were
transformed into stones. Three men escaped in a canoe and
drifted to the Nzukeski Mountains, where they and their
canoe were afterwards turned to stone; you may see them
there today. Coyote survived by turning himself into a
piece of wood and floating. When the flood subsided,
leaving him in the Thompson River area, he resumed his
normal shape. He took trees to be his wives, and from them
the Indians are descended. The flood left lakes in the
hollows of the mountains, streams flowing from them, and
fish in them; none of these existed before the flood. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 322]</p>
