<p>The giant frog (or turtle) which supported the earth
moved, which caused the cosmic ocean to begin flooding the
earth. An old man who had guessed something like this would
happen built an iron-reinforced raft, boarded it with his
family, and was saved. When the waters receded, the raft
was left on a high wooded mountain, where, it is said, it
remains today. After the flood, Kezer-Tshingis-Kaira-Khan
created everything around us. Among other things, he taught
people how to make strong liquor. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, p. 366]</p>
