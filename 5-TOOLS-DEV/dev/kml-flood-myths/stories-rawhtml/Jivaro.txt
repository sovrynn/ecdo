<p>Two boys found that the game they had hunted for a feast
kept disappearing while they were gone. One stayed in camp
and discovered a large snake was responsible. They built a
fire to drive the snake out of the hollow in a tree, where
it lived. The snake fell in the fire, and one of the
brothers ate some of its roasted flesh. He became very
thirsty, drank all the water in camp, and went to the lake.
He was transformed first into a frog, then a lizard, and
finally into a snake, which grew rapidly. His brother was
frightened and tried to pull him out, but the lake began to
overflow. The snake told his brother that the lake would
continue to grow and all the people would perish unless
they made their escape. The snake told him to take a
calabash and flee to a palm tree on the highest mountain.
The brother told his people what was happening, but they
didn't believe him. He fled to the top of a palm tree on
the top of a mountain and returned many days later when the
waters had subsided. Vultures were eating the dead people
in the valley. He went to the lake and carried away his
brother in a calabash. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp.

<p>A great cloud fell from heaven, turned to rain, and
killed all the inhabitants of earth. Only a man and his two
sons were saved. One of the sons was cursed by his father;
the Jivaros are descended from him. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p>
<p>According to some Jivaro, the flood was survived by a
man and woman, who took refuge in a cave on a high mountain
along with samples of all the various animal species. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p>
<p>Two brothers survived the flood in a mountain which rose
higher and higher with the flood waters. They went looking
for food after the flood, and when they returned, found
food set out for them. To find its source, one of the
brothers hid himself and saw two parrots with the faces of
women enter their hut and prepare the food. He jumped out,
seized one of the birds, and married it. From this union
came three boys and three girls from whom the Jivaros are
descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 126]</p>
