<p>In early times, the earth was full of malign creatures
fashioned by the evil Ahriman. The angel Tistar (the star
Sirius) descended three times, in the form of man, horse,
and bull respectively, causing ten days and nights of rain
each time. Each rain drop became as big as a bowl, and the
water rose the height of a man over the whole earth. The
first flood drowned the creatures, but the dead noxious
creatures went into holes in the earth. Before returning to
cause the second flood, Tistar, in the form of a white
horse, battled the demon Apaosha, who took the form of a
black horse. Ormuzd blasted the demon with lightning,
making the demon give a cry which can still be heard in
thunderstorms, and Tistar prevailed and caused rivers to
flow. The poison washed from the land by the second flood
made the seas salty. The waters were driven to the ends of
the earth by a great wind and became the sea Vourukasha
("Wide-Gulfed"). [<a href="#Carnoy">Carnoy</a>, p. 270; <a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, pp. 161-162; <a href="#HMiller">H. Miller</a>, p. 288]</p>
