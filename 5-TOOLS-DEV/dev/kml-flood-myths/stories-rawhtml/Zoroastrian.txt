<p>Yima, under divine superintendence, reigned over the
world for 900 years. As there was no disease or death, the
population increased so that it was necessary to enlarge
the earth after 300 years; Yima accomplished this with the
help of a gold ring and gold-inlaid dagger he had received
from Ahura Mazda, the Creator. Enlargement of the earth was
necessary again after 600 years. When the population became
too great after 900 years, Ahura Mazda warned Yima that
destruction was coming in the form of winter, frost, and
subsequent melting of the snow. He instructed Yima to build
a <i>vara</i>, a large square enclosure, in which to keep
specimens of small and large cattle, human beings, dogs,
birds, red flaming fires, plants and foodstuffs, two of
every kind. The men and cattle he brought in were to be the
finest on earth. Within the enclosure, men passed the
happiest of lives, with each year seeming like a day. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 180-182; <a href="#Dresden">Dresden</a>, p. 344]</p>
