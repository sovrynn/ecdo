<p>The Great Spirit created three kinds of men: red men,
white men with hairy heads, and hairy men with hair all
over their body. The hairy men went to the barren south and
eventually dwindled in numbers and disappeared. The red men
went south after the Great Spirit taught them culture. They
went north again when the Great Medicine told them the
south would be flooded. In the north, they found that the
white men had gone and they could no longer talk to the
animals, though they could still control them. Later, they
went south again, but another flood came and scattered
them, and they never came together again. They traveled in
small bands to the north, but they found it barren, so they
returned south and lived the best they could. One
particularly hard winter had earthquakes, volcanoes, and
floods which destroyed all the trees. The people spent the
long winter in caves and were almost famished the following
spring. The Great Medicine, in pity, gave them corn and
buffalo. Since then, there have been no more famines or
floods. [<a href="#Erdoes">Erdoes &amp; Ortiz</a>, pp.
