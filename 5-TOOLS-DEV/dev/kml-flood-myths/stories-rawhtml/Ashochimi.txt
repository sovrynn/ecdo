<p>A great flood covered the earth and drowned every living
creature except the coyote. He collected tail-feathers of
owls, hawks, eagles, and buzzards and traveled with them
all over the earth. Wherever a wigwam had stood before the
flood, he planted a feather. The feathers sprouted and
flourished, turning into men and women. Thus coyote
repopulated the world. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p.
