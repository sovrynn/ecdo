<p>A fight between the great forces of Good and Evil was
followed by an immense flood. It wiped out all traces of
the previous world and covered all the earth except two
islands. Coyote, the only living thing in the world, stood
on one of the islands (Mount Diablo or Pico Blanco). One
day, he saw a feather floating on the water. It turned into
Eagle as it reached the island. Later, they were joined by
Hummingbird. This trio created a new race of people. Eagle
told Coyote how to find a wife but did not tell him how to
make children. Coyote told the girl to louse him and to
swallow the woodtick she found. She became pregnant from
this. Afraid, she ran away to the ocean and turned into a
sand flea. Coyote found another wife and with her went out
over the world, founding five tribes with five different
languages. [<a href="#Margolin1978">Margolin 1978</a>, pp.
