<p>Heaven and Earth were great giants, and Heaven lay upon
the Earth so that their children were crowded between them,
and the children and their mother were unhappy in the
darkness. The boldest of the sons led his brothers in
cutting up Heaven into many pieces. From his skull they
made the firmament. His spilling blood caused a great flood
which killed all humans except a single pair, who were
saved in a ship made by a beneficent Titan. The waters
settled in hollows to become the oceans. The son who led in
the mutilation of Heaven was a Titan and became their king,
but the Titans and gods hated each other, and the king
titan was driven from his throne by his son, who was born a
god. That Titan at last went to the land of the departed.
The Titan who built the ship, whom some consider to be the
same as the king Titan, went there also. [<a href="#Sproul">Sproul</a>, pp. 172-173]</p>
