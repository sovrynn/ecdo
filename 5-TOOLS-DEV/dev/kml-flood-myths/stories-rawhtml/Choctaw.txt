<p>A prophet was sent by the high god to warn of a coming
flood, but nobody took notice. When the flood came, the
prophet took to a raft. After several months, he saw a
black bird. He signaled it, but it just cawed and flew
away. Later, he sighted and signaled a bluish bird. The
bird flapped, moaned dolorously, and guided the raft
towards where the sun was breaking through. Next morning,
he landed on an island with all kinds of animals. He cursed
the black bird (a crow) and blessed the bluish one (a
dove). [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 116]</p>
