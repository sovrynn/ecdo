<p>Christ ordered a man to build an ark and to take in it
pairs of all useful animals. The flood came and subsided.
The survivors began to cook fish, which the rest of the
former inhabitants of the world had been turned into.
Christ sent a buzzard to investigate, but the buzzard
stayed to eat fish. Then Christ sent down the hawk and
hummingbird and finally came himself. He turned the people
upside down, and they became monkeys. Christ repopulated
the world by turning the dead fish back into people. The
buzzard was condemned to eat only carrion thereafter. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, pp. 196-197]</p>
<p>God told a man to stop working, because a flood was
coming. The man was told to build a canoe to save himself
and his family. After the deluge came and went, the man
began to cook the bodies of the dead animals. Saint Peter
smelled the smoke and came to investigate. He turned the
man into a buzzard and his children into monkeys. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, p. 197]</p>
