<p>In the time of the great flood, "the Age of Water," the
sea broke against the Encamarada mountain chain, and people
were forced into canoes. One man and one woman were saved
on the high mountain called Tamanacu, on the banks of the
Asiveru. After the flood, as they descended the mountain
grieving the destruction of mankind, they heard a voice
telling them to throw the fruits of the Mauritia palm over
their heads behind them. People sprung from the kernels of
these fruits, men from those thrown by the man, and women
from those thrown by the woman. (This tradition occurs also
in neighboring tribes.) [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
