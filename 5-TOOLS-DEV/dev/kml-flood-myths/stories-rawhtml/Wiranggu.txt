<p>Djunban, a rain-maker, was hunting kangaroo rat with his
magic boomerang, but he hit his "sister" Mandjia instead
and wounded her leg. She hid the boomerang in the sand so
he couldn't find it. The people were on the move, so he
carried Mandjia. Later, he gave her to a woman to carry so
he could search for his boomerang, and eventually he found
it. Some time later he taught his people how to make rain.
The next day they all traveled further. Mandjia died from
her injury and metamorphosed into a rock. After traveling
the next day, Djunban performed the rain-making ceremony
again, but he was grieving his sister and not concentrating
on his task, and the rain came too heavily. He tried to
warn his people, but the flood came and washed away all the
people and their possessions, forming a hill of silt. Gold
and bones found in that hill came from those people. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 297-300]</p>
