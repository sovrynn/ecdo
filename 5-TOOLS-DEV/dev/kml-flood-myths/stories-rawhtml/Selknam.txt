<p>At one time, people didn't die; instead, they just slept
awhile and woke up refreshed. After many lives, some got
tired of being human and turned into rocks, clouds,
animals, and such. A flood came which covered the world.
People floundered around in the cold water. Some climbed
onto ice floes and joined the penguins, playing and eating
fish as the penguins did. In time, they turned into large
penguins. When the water went down, some people went back
to living as humans, but others stayed emperor penguins.
