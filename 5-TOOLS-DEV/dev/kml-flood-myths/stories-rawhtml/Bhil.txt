<p>Out of gratitude for the <i>dhobi</i> feeding it, a fish
told a <i>dhobi</i> (a pious man) that a great deluge was
coming. The man prepared a large box in which he embarked
with his sister and a cock. After the flood, a messenger of
Rama sent to find the state of affairs discovered the box
by the cock's crowing. Rama had the box brought to him and
questioned the man. Facing north, east, and west, the man
swore that the woman was his sister; facing south, the man
said she was his wife. Told that the fish gave the warning,
Rama had the fish's tongue removed, and fish have been
tongueless since. Rama ordered the man to repopulate the
world, so he married his sister, and they had seven
daughters and seven sons. The firstborn received a horse as
a gift from Rama, but, being unable to ride, he instead
went into the forest to cut wood, and so his descendants
have been woodcutters to this day. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 95-96]</p>
