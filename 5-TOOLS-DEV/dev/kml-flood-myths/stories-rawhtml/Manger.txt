<p>Crow got into an argument with two other men because he
accidentally let green ants contaminate their fish. They
took back their fish, and Crow took back the goose eggs he
had brought. They fought. Crow defeated them and left
saying they'd fight again. Crow went to his mother's tribe.
When the other two men appeared, the tribe put on a
ceremony rather than quarrelling more. When everyone else
had fallen asleep, Crow climbed a tree and chopped off a
branch, which fell and killed the two men. Then he poured
out a bag of honey which came down so heavily it flooded
the area. All the people turned into birds. [<a href="#Berndt">Berndt &amp; Berndt</a>, pp. 185-187]</p>
