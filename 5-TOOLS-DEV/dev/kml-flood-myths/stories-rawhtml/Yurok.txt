<p>The sky fell and hit the water, causing high breakers
that flooded all the land. That is why one can find shells
and redwood logs on the highest ridges. Two women and two
men jumped into a boat when they saw the water coming, and
they were the only people saved. Sky-Owner gave them a
song, and many days later the water fell when they sang it.
Sky-Owner sent a rainbow to tell them the water would never
cover the world again. [<a href="#Bell">Bell</a>, p.
