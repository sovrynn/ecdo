<p>A small gray bird, despite the prohibition of her
husband (a chicken hawk, <i>Accipiter cooperi</i>), bathed
in a certain lake after picking berries in the hot sun.
There she was seized and raped by a giant in the lake. The
bird's husband shot the monster, who in revenge swallowed
up all the water to keep others from having it. The woman
pulled out the arrow, and the water rushed forth in a
torrent. The husband and wife escaped to a mountain until
the flood receded. (In variant versions, the woman was
seized by a giant fish or water animal. The husband killed
it, and its blood caused the flood. The husband escaped up
a tree.) [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp. 147-148; <a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 323]</p>
