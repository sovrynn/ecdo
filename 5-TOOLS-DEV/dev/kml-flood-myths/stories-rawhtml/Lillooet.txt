<p>A great rain came, making the rivers and lakes overflow
the country. A man named Ntcinemkin took refuge with his
family in his very large canoe. The others fled to the
mountains, but the flood rose to cover them, too. The
people begged Ntcinemkin to save at least their children.
He didn't have room enough to hold all of them, so he took
one child from each family, alternating males and females.
The flood covered all land except the peak of Split
Mountain (<i>Ncikato</i>) on the west side of Lower
Lillooet Lake. When the waters dropped, the canoe grounded
on Smimelc Mountain. Each stage of the water's dropping is
marked by a terrace on the side of the mountain, which can
be seen today. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp.
