<p>Day after day, a dog stood at the river bank and howled
piteously. Rebuked by his master, the dog said a flood was
coming, and he must build and provision a boat.
Furthermore, the dog said, he must throw him, the dog, into
the water. For a sign that he spoke the truth, the dog
showed the back of his neck, which was raw and bare with
flesh and bone showing. The man followed directions, and he
and his family survived; from them, the present population
is descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp.
