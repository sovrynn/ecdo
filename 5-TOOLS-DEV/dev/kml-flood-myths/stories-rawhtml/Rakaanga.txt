<p>A chief named Taoiau, angered at his people for not
bringing him the sacred turtle, roused all the sea gods on
whose good will the islands depend. One, who sleeps at the
bottom of the sea, was roused to anger by the king's prayer
and stood straight up. A hurricane burst forth, and the sea
swept over the island of Rakaanga. A few inhabitants
survived by taking refuge on a mound. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 249]</p>
