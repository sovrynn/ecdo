<p>In primeval times, men were wicked. The patriarch
Tse-gu-dzih sent a messenger down to earth, asking for some
flesh and blood from a mortal. Only one man, Du-mu,
complied. In wrath, Tse-gu-dzih locked the rain-gates, and
the waters mounted to the sky. Du-mu was saved in a log
hollowed out of a <i>Pieris</i> tree, together with his
four sons and otters, wild ducks, and lampreys. The
civilized peoples who can write are descended from the
sons; the ignorant races are descendants of wooden figures
whom Du-mu constructed after the deluge. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 99-100]</p>
