<p>Some women gathered bamboo shoots, sat on a log, and
began paring them. But they noticed the trunk exuded drops
of blood with each cut of their knives. Some men came by
and saw that the trunk was actually a giant, torporous boa
constrictor. They killed it, cut it up, and took it home to
eat. While they were frying the pieces, strange noises came
from the frying pan and a torrential rain began. The rain
continued until only the highest hill remained above water.
Only a woman, dog, rat, and a few small creature survived.
The woman noticed that the dog had found shelter from the
rain under a creeper warmed by the rubbing between the
creeper and a tree in the wind. She took the hint, rubbed
the creeper against a piece of wood, and produced fire for
the first time. The woman took the fire-drill for her mate
and gave birth to a son called Simpang-impang. He was only
half a man, with only one arm, one leg, etc. Some time
later, the Spirit of the Wind carried off some rice which
Simpang-impang had spread out to dry. Simpang-impang
demanded compensation. The Spirit of the Wind refused but
was vanquished in a series of contests and restored
Simpang-impang's missing parts. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 101-102]</p>
<p>When the flood came, a man named Trow made a boat from a
large wooden mortar previously used for pounding rice. He
took with him his wife, a dog, pig, cat, fowl, and other
animals, and rode out the flood. Afterwards, to repeople
the earth, Trow fashioned additional wives out of a log,
stone, and anything else handy. Soon he had a large family
which became the ancestors of the various Dyak tribes. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 102]</p>
<p>Once, when much of a ripe harvest was found despoiled, a
watch was kept, and a great serpent was seen to lower
itself from the sky and feed on the rice. People rushed up
and cut off its head, and one of the men fed on some of the
flesh the following morning. No sooner had he done so,
however, when a terrible storm arose, causing a flood which
killed all but the few who escaped to the highest hills.
