<p>A hunter heard whistling at a riverbank, and suspecting
it was something from the spirit world, went home and used
tobacco smoke to induce a dream. In it, he was told by the
daughter of the water spirit Tsunki to return to the river.
He did so, met the woman, and followed her underwater to
her father's house. The woman's mother gave him an
aphrodisiac, and he became her husband. When he returned to
his home on earth, she took the form of a snake. She became
pregnant, and the man had to go out hunting. While he was
out, his two earthly wives discovered the snake and
tormented her, and she returned to her father. Tsunki, in a
rage, flooded the earth, drowning everyone but the hunter
and one of his daughters, who escaped to a mountaintop.
These two repopulated the world. [<a href="#Bierhorst1988">Bierhorst, 1988</a>, p. 218]</p>
