<p>A deluge covered the whole earth. A few people survived
on the back of a turtle which was so old its shell was
mossy. A loon flew by, and the people begged it to dive and
bring up some land. The bird dived but could not reach the
bottom. Then he flew far away, came back with some earth in
his bill, and led the turtle back to some dry land. There
the people settled and repopulated the country. Those saved
by the turtle became the Turtle Clan. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 295; <a href="#Bierhorst1995">Bierhorst</a>, 1995, pp. 30, 43]</p>
<p>After the Great Spirit created the earth, he flooded it.
He sent various animals diving for earth. At last the
muskrat succeeded. He put the earth on the turtles back,
and it increased in size. [<a href="#Bierhorst1995">Bierhorst</a>, 1995, p. 44]</p>
