<p>Seven people were saved in a boat from a flood. A
terrible draught followed the flood, but the people were
saved by digging a deep hole in which water formed.
However, all but one young man and woman died of hunger.
These two saved themselves by eating the mice which came
out of the ground. The human race is descended from this
couple. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, pp. 367-368]</p>
