<p>Long ago, there were a great many different tribes, and
they quarrelled and made war on each other. The worship of
Tane, the creator, was being neglected and his doctrines
denied. Two prophets, Para-whenua-mea and Tupu-nui-a-uta,
taught the true doctrine about the separation of heaven and
earth, but others just mocked them, and they became angry.
So they built a large raft at the source of the Tohinga
River, built a house on it, and provisioned it with
fern-root, sweet potatoes, and dogs. Then they prayed for
abundant rain to convince men of the power of Tane. Two men
named Tiu and Reti, a woman named Wai-puna-hau, and other
women also boarded the raft. Tiu was the priest on the
raft, and he recited the prayers and incantations for rain.
It rained hard for four or five days, until Tiu prayed for
the rain to stop. But though the rain stopped, the waters
still rose and bore the raft down the Tohinga river and
onto the sea. In the eighth month, the waters began to
thin; Tiu knew this by the signs of his staff. At last they
landed at Hawaiki. The earth had been much changed by the
flood, and the people on the raft were the only survivors.
They worshipped Tane, Rangi (Heaven), Rehua, and all the
gods, each at a separate alter. After making fire by
friction, they made thanks-offerings of seaweed for their
rescue. Today, only the chief priest may go to those holy
spots. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 110-112; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 133]</p>
<p>Two brothers-in-law of the hero Tawhaki attacked him and
left him for dead. He recovered, and retired with his own
warriors and their families to a high mountain, where he
built a fortified village. Then he called to the gods, his
ancestors, for revenge. The floods of heaven descended and
killed everyone on earth. This event was called "The
overwhelming of the Mataaho." [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 112]</p>
<p>In another version of the story, Tawhaki, a man, put on
a garment of lightning and was worshipped as a god. Once,
in a fit of anger, he stamped on the floor of heaven,
breaking it and releasing the celestial waters which
flooded the earth. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p.
112]</p>
<p>In another version, the flood was caused by the copious
weeping of Tawhaki's mother. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>,
