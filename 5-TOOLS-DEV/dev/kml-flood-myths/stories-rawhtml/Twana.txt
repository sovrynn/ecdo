<p>The people were wicked, and to punish them, a flood came
which covered all the land except one mountain. The people
escaped in their canoes to the highest peak in their
country, which they call "Fastener." With long ropes, they
tied their canoes to the tallest tree on the peak, but the
water rose over it. Some of the canoes broke their moorings
and drifted west; those people formed a tribe to the west
which speaks a language like that of the Twanas. Because
those people drifted away, the present Twana tribe is
small. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 324]</p>
