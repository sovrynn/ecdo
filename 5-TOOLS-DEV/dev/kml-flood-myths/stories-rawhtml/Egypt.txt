<p>People have become rebellious. Atum said he will destroy
all he made and return the earth to the Primordial Water
which was its original state. Atum will remain, in the form
of a serpent, with Osiris. [<a href="#Faulkner">Faulkner</a>, plate 30] (Unfortunately the
version of the papyrus with the flood story is damaged and
unclear. See also <a href="#Budge">Budge</a>, p. ccii.)</p>
