<p>To find out why Noah was building an ark, the devil told
Noah's wife to prepare a strong drink. Noah, drunk from
this drink, told the secret God entrusted him with. The
devil hindered Noah's work, and when the ship was finished,
sneaked into it in the company of the wife, who had tempted
her husband into saying the devil's name. Once in the ark,
he assumed the form of a mouse and gnawed holes in the
bottom of the ark. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, p.
