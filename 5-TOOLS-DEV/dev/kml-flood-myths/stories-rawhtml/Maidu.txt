<p>As the Indians of old lived tranquilly in the Sacramento
Valley, a mighty rushing of waters came suddenly, so that
the whole valley became like an ocean. Many Indians were
overtaken by the waters, and the frogs and the salmon
overtook and ate many others. Only two escaped to the
hills, but the Great Man made them fruitful, so the world
was soon repopulated with many tribes. One man was a chief
of great renown over all the nations. He went to a knoll
overlooking the waters that covered the fertile plains of
his ancestors. For nine sleeps he lay there without food,
meditating on how that water had come there. At the end of
nine sleeps, he was changed so that no arrow could harm
him. He commanded the Great Man to let the waters flow from
the plains. The Great Man opened the side of a mountain,
and the waters flowed away to the ocean. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 290-291]</p>
