<p>In early times, many people had gone to war with other
tribes; even medicine men had killed people. But there were
still some good people. One of the good men heard from the
Land Above that a big water was coming. He told the other
good people, and they decided they would make a dugout boat
from the largest cedar they could find. Soon after the
canoe was finished, the flood came, filling the valleys and
covering the mountains. The bad people were drowned; the
good people were saved in the boat. We don't know how long
the flood stayed. The canoe came down where it was built
and can still be seen on the east side of Toppenish Ridge.
The earth will be destroyed by another flood if people do
wrong a second time. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, p.
