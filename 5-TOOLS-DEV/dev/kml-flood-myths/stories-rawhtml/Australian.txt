<p>Grumuduk, a medicine man who lived in the hills, had the
power to bring rain and to make plants and animals
plentiful. A plains tribe kidnapped him, wanting his power,
but Grumuduk escaped and decreed that wherever he walked in
the country of his enemies, salt water would rise in his
footsteps. [<a href="#Flood">Flood</a>, p. 179]</p>
