<p>A charitable man gave away everything he had to the
animals. His family deserted him, but when he gave his last
meal to the (unrecognized) god Ouende, Ouende rewarded him
with three handfuls of flour which renewed itself and
produced even greater riches. Then Ouende advised him to
leave the area, and sent six months of rain to destroy his
selfish neighbors. The descendants of the rich man became
the present human race. [<a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, pp.
