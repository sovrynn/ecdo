<p>Nexquiriac sent down a great flood to punish mankind for
its very wicked ways. He instructed one good man to make a
large box and to preserve himself in it, along with many
animals and seeds of certain plants. When the flood was
almost over, Nexquiriac told the man not to come out, but
to bury the box, along with himself, until the face of the
earth had been burned. After that was done, the man emerged
and repopulated the earth. [<a href="#Horcasitas">Horcasitas</a>, p. 192]</p>
