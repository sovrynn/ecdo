<p>In one version of the myth of the Wawalik sisters, the
sisters, with their two infant children, camped by the
Mirrirmina waterhole. Some of the older sister's menstrual
blood fell into the well. The rainbow serpent Yurlunggur
smelled the blood and crawled out of his well. He spit some
well water into the sky and hissed to call for rain. The
rains came, and the well water started to rise. The women
hurriedly built a house and went inside, but Yurlunggur
caused them to sleep. He swallowed them and their sons.
Then he stood very straight and tall, reaching as high as a
cloud, and the flood waters came as high as he did. When he
fell, the waters receded and there was dry ground. [<a href="#Buchler">Buchler</a>, pp. 134-135]</p>
<p>Two orphaned children were left in the care of a man
called Wirili-up, who shirked the responsibility. The
children, always hungry, cried so much that a
<i>ngaljod</i> (rainbow serpent) rose from his waterhole
and flooded the countryside. Wirili-up fled, but the
children drowned. [<a href="#Mountford">Mountford</a>, p.
