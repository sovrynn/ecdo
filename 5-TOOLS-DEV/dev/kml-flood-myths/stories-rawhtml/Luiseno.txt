<p>A great flood covered high mountains and drowned most
people. A few saved themselves on a knoll called Mora by
the Spaniards and Katuta by the Indians, staying there
until the flood went down. The hill still has stones,
ashes, and heaps of seashells showing where the Indians
cooked their food. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp.
