<p>Very long ago, a flood covered everything but three
mountains, one near Bella-Bella, one northeast of there,
and a hill called Ko-Kwus on Don Island which rose with the
flood to stay above the water. Nearly all people floated on
logs and trees in different directions. Some people had
small canoes with anchors and managed to land near their
homes when the water subsided. Of the Hailtzuk only two
men, a woman, and a dog survived. One of the men landed at
Ka-pa, one at another village site, and the woman and dog
at Bella-Bella. The Bella-Bella Indians descended from the
marriage of the woman and dog. There was no fresh water
when the flood subsided. The raven showed people where they
could dig for a little water and how chewing on cedar
brought water into their mouths. This sustained them until
a great rain came which filled the lakes and rivers. It is
still understood, though, that without cedars there would
be no water. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 321]</p>
