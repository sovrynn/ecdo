<p>Twice, a great flood came. Afraid that another might
come, the people made a giant canoe from a big cedar. When
they saw a third flood coming, they put the bravest young
men and fairest young women in the canoe, with plenty of
food. Then the flood, bigger and deeper than the earlier
ones, swallowed the land. It rained for many days and
nights, but when the clouds finally parted for the third
time, the people saw land (Mount Jefferson) and paddled to
it. When the water receded, they made their home at the
base of the mountain. The canoe was turned to stone and can
be seen on Mount Jefferson today. [<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>. pp. 14-15]</p>
