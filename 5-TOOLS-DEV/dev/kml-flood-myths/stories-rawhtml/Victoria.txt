<p>Bunjil, the creator, was angry with people because of
the evil they did, so he caused the ocean to flood by
urinating into it. All people were destroyed except those
whom Bunjil loved and fixed as stars in the sky, and a man
and a woman who climbed a tall tree on a mountain, and from
whom the present human race is descended. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 114]</p>
<p>A man fishing in a lake caught a young <i>bunyip</i>, a
fearsome water monster. His companions begged him to let it
go lest he anger the water monsters by killing it, but he
refused to listen and began carrying it away. The
<i>bunyip's</i> mother, in a rage, caused the waters of the
lake to follow the man who had taken her young. The waters
rose higher and higher, covering all the country. The
people fled to a high hill, but the flood rose, and when it
touched their feet, they turned into black swans. [<a href="#Dixon">Dixon</a>, p. 280]</p>
