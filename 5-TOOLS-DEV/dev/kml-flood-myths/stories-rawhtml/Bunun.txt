<p>A heavy rain fell for many days, and a giant snake lay
across the river, blocking it so that the whole land
flooded. Many people drowned, and the few survivors fled to
the highest mountain, but they still feared as the waters
kept rising. A crab appeared and cut through the body of
the snake, and the flood subsided. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 232]</p>
<p>A giant crab caught and tried to eat a large snake, but
the snake managed to escape into the ocean. Immediately a
great flood covered the world. The ancestors of the Bunun
escaped to Mount Usabeya (Niitaka-yama) and Mount Shinkan,
where they lived by hunting until the waters receded. They
returned to find their fields washed away, but a stalk of
millet remained. They planted its seeds and subsisted on
its produce. Before the flood, the land had been quite
flat; many mountains and valleys were formed by it. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 232-233]</p>
