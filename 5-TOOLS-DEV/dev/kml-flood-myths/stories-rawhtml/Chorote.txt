<p>The bottle tree (<i>Chorisia insignis</i>) once
contained all the water and all the fish. The tree had a
locked door. Fox stole the key and thoughtlessly opened the
door wide. The waters rushed out, flooding the world and
bringing all kinds of fish. Fox drowned. [<a href="#Bierhorst1988">Bierhorst, 1988</a>, p. 123]</p>
<p>In a former time when there were a great many people,
the earth sank. Then water began to seep out. It kept
rising until it became a flood. Some boys were saved,
plucked from the water by a white bird; all other people
drowned. [<a href="#Bierhorst1988">Bierhorst, 1988</a>, p.
