<p>People were once fighting among themselves, and Father
God (<i>Tata Dios</i>) sent much rain, drowning everyone.
After the flood, God sent three men and three women to
repopulate the earth. They planted three kinds of corn
which still grow in the country. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 124]</p>
<p>When all the world was flooded, a little boy and girl
climbed the mountain Lavachi ("Gourd") south of Panalachic.
They came down when the flood subsided, bringing with them
three grains of corn and three beans. The rocks were so
soft that their feet sank into them, leaving footprints
that can still be seen today. They planted the corn, slept
and dreamed, and harvested. All Tarahumares are descended
from them. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, p. 281]</p>
