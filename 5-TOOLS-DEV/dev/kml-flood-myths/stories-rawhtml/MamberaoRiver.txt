<p>A rising river caused a flood which overwhelmed Mount
Vanessa. Only a man and his wife, a pig, a cassowary, a
kangaroo, and a pigeon escaped. These became the ancestors
of humans and other species. The bones of the drowned
animals can still be found on Mount Vanessa. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp. 105-106]</p>
