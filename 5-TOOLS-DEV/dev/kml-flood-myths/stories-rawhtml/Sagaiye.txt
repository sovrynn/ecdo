<p>God told Noj to build a ship. The devil tempted his wife
to find out what he was building in the forest. When the
devil found out, he destroyed by night what Noj built by
day, so the boat was not completed when the flood came. God
was forced to send down an iron vessel in which Noj, his
wife and family, and all kinds of animals were saved. [<a href="#Holmberg">Holmberg</a>, p. 362]</p>
