<p>The natives laughed at the old man Nol for making a
canoe far inland, but he declared that he would need no
help getting it to the sea; the sea would come to it. When
he had finished, rain fell in torrents, flooding the island
and drowning everybody. Nol's canoe was lifted by the
water. It struck a rock that was still out of water and
split the rock two. (These two rocks can still be seen.)
The waters then rushed back into the sea, leaving Lifou
dry. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, p. 107]</p>
