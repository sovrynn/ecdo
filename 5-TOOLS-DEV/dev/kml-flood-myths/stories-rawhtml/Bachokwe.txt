<p>A chieftainess named Moena Monenga sought food and
shelter in a village. She was refused, and when she
reproached the villagers for their selfishness, they said,
in effect, "What can you do about it"? So she began a slow
incantation, and on the last long note, the whole village
sank into the ground, and water flowed into the depression,
forming what is now Lake Dilolo. When the village's
chieftain returned from the hunt and saw what had happened
to his family, he drowned himself in the lake. [<a href="#Vitaliano">Vitaliano</a>, pp. 164-165; <a href="#Kelsen">Kelsen</a>, p. 136]</p>
