<p>Long ago, a great storm came. The people baked a great
earthen pot, in which two people saved themselves. Since
rattlesnakes were then the friends of man, two rattlesnakes
were saved in the pot, too. The red-headed woodpecker clung
to the sky, but the waters rose so high they wet and marked
his tail. When the waters sank, the woodpecker was sent to
find land, but he could find none. The dove was sent next
and came back with a grain of sand. When this grain was
placed on the water, it spread out and became dry land. [<a href="#Judson">Judson</a>, p. 19]</p>
<p>When the earth was first made, all was under water. The
Creator sent Crawfish to bring up a little earth. The mud
he brought up spread out, and dry earth appeared. [<a href="#Judson">Judson</a>, p. 5]</p>
