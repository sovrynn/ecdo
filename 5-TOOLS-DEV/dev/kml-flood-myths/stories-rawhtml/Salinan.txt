<p>The old woman of the sea, jealous of Eagle's power, came
with her basket in which she carried the sea. She
continually poured out water until it covered the land,
almost to the top of Santa Lucia Peak where the animals
gathered. Eagle borrowed Puma's whiskers, made a lariat
from them, and lassoed the basket. The sea stopped rising,
and the old woman died. Eagle told Dove to fetch up some
mud, and he made the world from it. Eagle shaped the first
people, a woman and two men, from elder-wood. After
sweating in a sweat-house, he blew on them and gave them
life. Then they had a great fiesta. [<a href="#Sproul">Sproul</a>, p. 236]</p>
