<p>Shortly after the peopling of the world, a fisherman
carelessly let his hooks get entangled in the hair of the
sea god Ruahatu, who was reposing among the coral, and
disturbed the god's rest when wrenching them out. The angry
god surfaced, upbraided the fisherman, and threatened to
destroy the land in revenge. The fisherman prostrated
himself and apologized profusely. Moved by his penitence,
Ruahatu told him to go with his wife and child to
Toamarama, a small low island (not more than two feet above
sea level) in a lagoon on the east side of Raiatea. This he
did, taking also some domesticated animals. As the sun set,
the ocean waters began to rise and continued rising all
night. The other inhabitants fled to the mountains, but at
last even these were covered, and everyone on Raiatea
perished. When the waters receded, the fisherman and his
family returned to the mainland and became progenitors of
its present inhabitants. [<a href="#Gaster">Gaster</a>, pp.
