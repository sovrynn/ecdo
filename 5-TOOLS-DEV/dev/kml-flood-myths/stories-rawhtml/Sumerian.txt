<p>The gods had decided to destroy mankind. The god Enlil
warned the priest-king Ziusudra ("Long of Life") of the
coming flood by speaking to a wall while Ziusudra listened
at the side. He was instructed to build a great ship and
carry beasts and birds upon it. Violent winds came, and a
flood of rain covered the earth for seven days and nights.
Then Ziusudra opened a window in the large boat, allowing
sunlight to enter, and he prostrated himself before the
sun-god Utu. After landing, he sacrificed a sheep and an ox
and bowed before Anu and Enlil. For protecting the animals
and the seed of mankind, he was granted eternal life and
taken to the country of Dilmun, where the sun rises. [<a href="#Hammerly">Hammerly-Dupuy</a>, p. 56; <a href="#Heidel">Heidel</a>, pp. 102-106]</p>
