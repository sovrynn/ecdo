<p>Noah invited all animals to save themselves aboard his
ark, but the mammoths thought there would not be much of a
flood and that their legs were long enough to deal with it,
so they stayed outside and became extinct. The other
animals believed Noah and were saved. [<a href="#Frazer">Frazer</a>, pp. 328-329]</p>
