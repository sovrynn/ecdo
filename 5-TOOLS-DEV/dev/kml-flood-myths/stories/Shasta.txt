Coyote encountered an evil water spirit who said, "There
is no wood" and caused water to rise until it covered
Coyote. After the water receded, Coyote shot the water
spirit with a bow and ran away, but the water followed him.
He ran to the top of Mount Shasta; the water followed but
didn't quite reach the top. Coyote made a fire, and all the
other animal people swam to it and found refuge there.
After the water receded, they came down, made new homes,
and became the ancestors of all the animal people today.
