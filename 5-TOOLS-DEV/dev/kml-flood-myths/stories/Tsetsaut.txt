A man and his wife went up the hills to hunt marmots.
There, they saw that the water was still rising. They
enclosed their children, along with supplies, in hollow
trees. The water rose further, and all other people
drowned. The children went to sleep, and when they awoke,
one of the boys opened a hole, and they came out, the
waters having had receded. [Roheim,
pp. 159-160]
