Some adventurous Indians, looking for a reputed land of
abundance, travelled to the Amazonian jungle. To make a
clearing, they set the forest alight. The gods of the
mountains were angry at the smoke dirtying their snow.
Khuno, the snow god, decided to kill them with a flood, but
the mountain god Illimani suggested instead that they be
driven to great hardship. Khuno sent a flood that spared
their lives but destroyed everything they had managed to
build and grow. The people were almost hopeless, but one
was attracted to a brilliant green plant, coca. He chewed
its leaves and forgot his discomforts, and the others
followed his example. When they all felt strong again, they
returned to Tiahuanaco, taking coca with them. [Gifford, p. 76]
