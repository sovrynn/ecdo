After seven years of drought, the Great Woman said to
the Great Man that rains had come elsewhere; how should
they save themselves. The Great Man counseled the other
giants to make boats from cut poplars, anchor them with
ropes of willow roots 500 fathoms long, and provide them
with seven days of food and with pots of melted butter to
grease the ropes. Those who did not make all the
preparations perished when the waters came. After seven
days, the waters sank. But all plants and animals had
perished, even the fish. The survivors, on the brink of
starvation, prayed to the great god Numi-t√¢rom, who
recreated living things. [Gaster, pp.
