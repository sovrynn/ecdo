The Sun, the Moon, and their two children "Old Man" and
"Apistotoki God" began creating the world. They were given
sand, stone, water, and the hide of a fisher with which to
complete the creation. A flood came, and they could save
only those four things. Later, they created an old man, a
dog, a man, and a woman. After a second flood, only those
four were left on earth, and they created the rest of the
world. [von Franz, p. 163]
