A louse and a flea were brewing beer in an eggshell. The
louse fell in and burnt herself. This made the flea weep,
which made the door creak, which made the broom sweep,
which made the cart run, which made the ash-heap burn,
which made the tree shake itself, which made the girl break
her water-pitcher, which made the spring begin to flow. And
in the spring's water everything was drowned. [Grimm 30]
