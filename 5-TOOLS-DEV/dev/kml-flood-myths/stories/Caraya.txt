The Carayas, hunting pigs, drove them into their dens
and began pulling them out and killing them. In doing so,
they also came upon a deer, a tapir, a white deer, and
finally the feet of a man. They fetched a magician, who
drew the man from the earth. This man was Anatiua; he had a
thin body but fat paunch. He sang that he wanted tobacco,
but the Carayas didn't understand him and offered him all
kinds of flowers and fruits until Anatiua pointed at a man
smoking. Then they gave him tobacco. He smoked it until he
fell senseless. They took him back to their village, where
he awoke and began to dance and sing. But his behavior and
unintelligible speech so alarmed the Carayas that they
packed up and left. This angered Anatiua, and he turned
himself into a giant piranha and followed them, carrying
many calabashes full of water. The Carayas didn't heed his
calls to stop, so he smashed his calabashes one at a time,
making the water rise until only the mountains at the mouth
of the Tapirape River were exposed. The Carayas took refuge
on the two peaks of those mountains. Anatiua called on the
fish to drag the people into the water. The jahu,
pintado, and pacu failed, but the
bicudo managed to scale the mountain from behind and
pull the people from the summit; a lagoon still marks where
they fell. Only a few people survived, who descended when
the flood had gone. [Frazer, pp.
