Water covered the world except for the top of the
highest mountain. People escaped to there, but they were
starving. The water went down, leaving the ground a soft
mud. The people rolled down rocks to see if the mud was
hard enough to support them. When the rocks stayed on top
of the mud, the people went down. But the mud was not hard
enough, and the people sank out of sight. Ravens came and
stood at the holes where the people had gone down, one
Raven at each hole. When the ground hardened, the ravens
turned into people. That is why the Miwok are so dark. [Merriam, p. 101]
