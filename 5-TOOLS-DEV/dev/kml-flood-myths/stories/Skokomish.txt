The Great Spirit, angry with the wickedness of people
and animals, decided to rid the earth of all but the good
animals, one good man, and his family. At the Great
Spirit's direction, the man shot an arrow into a cloud,
then another arrow into that arrow, and so on, making a
rope of arrows from the cloud to the ground. The good
animals and people climbed up. Bad animals and snakes
started to climb up, but the man broke off the rope. Then
the Great Spirit caused many days of rain, flooding up to
the snow line of Takhoma (Mount Ranier). After all the bad
people and animals were drowned, the Great Spirit stopped
the rain, the waters slowly dropped, and the good people
and animals climbed down. To this day there are no snakes
on Takhoma. [Clark, pp. 31-32]
Once a big flood came. People made ropes of twisted
cedar limbs and used them to fasten their canoes to
mountains. The flood covered the Olympic Mountains. Some of
the ropes broke, and the canoes drifted to the country of
the Flatheads. That is why the Skokomish and the Flatheads
speak the same language. [Clark, p.
