In the first days, the water from the sea came up and
flooded all the earth except for a very high mountain in
the middle. A few animals escaped to this mountain, and a
few people survived in a boat, subsisting on fish. The
people landed on the mountain as the water subsided and
followed the retreating water to the coast. The animals
also descended. [Gaster, p. 120]
