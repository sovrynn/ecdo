People made the lizards angry first by making a lot of
noise and then by teasing them. Finally, the people
incurred the wrath of the Lizard Man, who caused it to rain
for days, and the water rose. People climbed to the highest
mountain, but still the rain came and the water rose
higher. People were drowning. Two brothers built a small
raft and climbed aboard. Others tried to climb on with
them, but the raft held only two. The two brothers floated
off, and only they survived the flood. [LaHaye & Morris, p. 231]
