A flood killed all animals and humans except for two
Shaman, who survived in a boat. They copulated, and their
offspring included the world's first women. [Balikci]
The giant Inugpasugssuk waded into the ocean to hunt
seals. His penis stuck up out of the water so far away that
he thought it was a seal putting its head up, and he struck
it by mistake. He fell backwards in pain, and that raised a
wave that flooded the whole district of Arviligjuaq. [Norman, p. 233]
