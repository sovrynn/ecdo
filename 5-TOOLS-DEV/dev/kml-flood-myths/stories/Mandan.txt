The earth is a large tortoise. Once a tribe, digging for
badgers, dug deep into the earth and cut through the shell
of Tortoise. Tortoise began to sink, and water rose through
the knife cut. The water covered all the ground and drowned
all the people except one man, Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah, who
escaped in a large canoe to a mountain in the west. Today,
a plank structure called the "big canoe" stands in the
central plaza of a Mandan village. The Mandans celebrate
the subsidence of the flood every year with a ceremony
called Mee-nee-ro-ka-ha-sha, held when willow leaves
are fully grown because the twig that the turtle-dove
brought home had such leaves. In the ceremony, a man
representing the survivor collects edged tools from each
household; these are later thrown into a deep pool. If this
sacrifice is not made, the man says, another flood will
come and destroy everyone. [Judson,
