Shortly after people arrived on earth, all crops grew on
a single tree. The culture hero Makunaima and his four
brothers cut down the tree, and water immediately poured
from the stump, and with it came fish. One of the brothers
made a basket to stop the water, but Makunaima wanted a few
more fish for the rivers. When he lifted the basket just a
little, water came out full force, flooding the earth. Some
people survived in canoes or by climbing tall palms until
the water subsided. (In some versions of this myth, the
water from the stump merely forms rivers.) [Bierhorst, 1988, pp. 79-80]
