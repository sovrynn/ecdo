Long ago, when men had become evil, the Strong Serpent
Maskanako came. He was the foe of people, and they
became embroiled, hating and fighting each other. The small
men (Mattapewi) fought with Nihanlowit,
keeper of the dead. The Strong Serpent resolved to destroy
all men, and the Black Serpent brought the snake-water
rushing, spreading everywhere, destroying everything. Then
the waters ran off, and the great evil went away by the
path of the cave. [Kelsen, pp.
146-147]
