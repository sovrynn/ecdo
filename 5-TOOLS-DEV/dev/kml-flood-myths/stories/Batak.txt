The earth once rested on the three horns of the giant
snake Naga Padoha, who grew tired of its burden and shook
it off into the sea. The god Batara Guru, to recover it
from the abyss, sent his daughter Puti-orla-bulan (who had
requested the mission). She came down on a white owl and
accompanied by a dog, but they found no place to rest.
Batara Guru let Mount Bakarra fall from heaven for her
abode; from it, the rest of the habitable earth gradually
arose. Puti-orla-bulan had three sons and three daughters
from whom the human race is descended. Later, the earth was
replaced onto the head of the snake, and there has been a
constant struggle between the snake, wanting to be free of
its burden, and the deity. Batara Guru sent his son
Layang-layang-mandi ("Diving Swallow") to bind Naga
Padoha's hands and feet, but the serpent still struggles
and causes earthquakes, and it will again throw the earth
into the sea when it breaks its fetters. When this happens,
men will either be transported to heaven or cast into a
flaming cauldron; the sun will approach close to our world,
and its flame will join with the cauldron's fire to consume
the material universe. [Frazer, pp.
217-218; Kelsen, p. 133]
Debata, the Creator, sent a flood to destroy every
living thing when the earth grew old and dirty. The last
pair of humans took refuge on the highest mountain, and the
flood had already reached their knees, when Debata repented
his decision to destroy mankind. He tied a clod of earth to
a thread and lowered it. The last pair stepped onto it and
were saved. As the couple and their descendants multiplied,
the clod increased in size, becoming the earth we inhabit
today. [Gaster, p. 100]
