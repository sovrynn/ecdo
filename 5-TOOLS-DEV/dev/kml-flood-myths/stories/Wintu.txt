People came into existence and dwelt a long, long time.
Then one of them dreamed of a whirlwind, and the others
said he had dreamed something bad. After that it blew, and
the wind increased. The world was going bad. At noon they
all went into an earth lodge. It blew terribly. Trees fell
down westward. The one who had dreamed stayed outside and
told the others it was raining, the water was coming, the
earth will be destroyed. All the other houses were blown
away. He came into the earth lodge and leaned against the
pole. At last the pole came loose too. The one who dreamed
was the last destroyed of all the people. The world was
destroyed and water alone was left. After some time,
Olelbes (He-Who-Is-Above) looked down all around and
finally saw something barely visible in the north in the
middle of the water. It swam around a little. It was
lamprey eel, the first to come into existence, and it lay
on the bedrock. On the rocks lay a little mud. No one knows
how long the waters sat there. At last it receded to the
south, turning into numerous creeks. A little earth came
into being, and it turned into all kinds of trees. [Margolin 1981, pp. 128-129]
