The wife of a very good man saw a very big fish. She
called her husband, but he couldn't see it until he hid
behind a banana tree and peeked through its leaves. When he
finally saw it, he was horribly afraid and forbade his
wife, son, and two daughters to catch and eat the fish. But
other people caught the fish and, heedless of the man's
warning, ate it. When the good man saw that, he hastily
drove a pair of all kinds of animals into trees and climbed
into a coconut tree with his family. As soon as the wicked
men ate the fish, water violently burst from the ground and
drowned everyone on it. As soon as the water reached the
treetops, it sank rapidly, and the good man and his family
came down and laid out new plantations. [Gaster, p. 105]
