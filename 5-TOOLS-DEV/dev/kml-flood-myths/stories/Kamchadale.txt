A flood covered the whole land in the early days of the
world. A few people saved themselves on rafts made from
bound-together tree trunks. They carried their property and
provisions and used stones tied to straps as anchors to
prevent being swept out to sea. They were left stranded on
mountains when the waters receded. [Holmberg, p. 368; Gaster, p. 100]
