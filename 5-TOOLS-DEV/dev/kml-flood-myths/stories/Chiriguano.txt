The evil supernatural being Aguara-Tunpa declared war
against the god Tunpaete, Creator of the Chiriguanos. He
set fire to the prairies in autumn, destroying all the
plants and land animals. The people, who had not then begun
farming, nearly died of hunger, but they retreated to the
banks of rivers and survived on fish. Seeing people still
surviving, Aguara-Tunpa caused a torrential rain. Acting on
a hint given them by Tunpaete, the Chiriguanos placed two
sibling babies, a boy and a girl, on a large mate leaf and
set it afloat on the water. The flood rose, covering the
earth and killing the rest of the Chiriguanos, but the two
babies survived and eventually landed on solid ground when
the flood sank. There, they found fish to eat, but they had
no way to cook it. Fortunately, before the flood, a frog
had taken some hot coals in his mouth, and it kept them
alight during the flood by blowing on them. He gave the
fire to the children, and they were able to roast their
fish. In time, they grew up, and the Chiriguanos are
descended from them. [Gaster, pp.
