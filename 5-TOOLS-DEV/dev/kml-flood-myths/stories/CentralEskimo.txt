The ocean rose suddenly and continued rising until it
covered even the tops of mountains. Ice drifted on the
water, and when the flood subsided, ice was stranded to
form ice-caps on the tops of mountains. The shells and
bones of many shellfish, fish, seals, and whales were also
left high above sea level, where they may be found today.
Many people drowned, but many others were saved in their
boats. [Frazer, pp. 327-328]
