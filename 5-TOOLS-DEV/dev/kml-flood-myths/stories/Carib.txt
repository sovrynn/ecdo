The Master of Spirits, angered at the people for not
giving the offerings due him, caused a heavy rain to fall
for several days, drowning the people. Only a few survived,
escaping by canoe to an isolated mountain. This flood
separated the Carib's islands from the mainland and caused
their present terrain. [Frazer, p.
