Sing Bonga created man from the dust of the ground, but
they soon grew wicked and lazy, would not wash, and spent
all their time dancing and singing. Sing Bonga regretted
creating them and resolved to destroy them by flood. He
sent a stream of fire-water (Sengle-Daa) from
heaven, and all people died save a brother and sister who
had hidden beneath a tiril tree (hence tiril
wood is black and charred today). God thought better of his
deed and created the snake Lurbing to stop the fiery rain.
This snake held up the showers by puffing up its soul into
the shape of a rainbow. Now Mundas associate the rainbow
with Lurbing destroying the rain. [Frazer, p. 196]
