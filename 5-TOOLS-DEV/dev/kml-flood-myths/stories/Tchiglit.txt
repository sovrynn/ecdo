A great flood broke over the land. Driven by the wind,
it submerged people's dwellings. The people formed a raft
by tying several boats together and pitched a tent against
the icy blast. They huddled together for warmth as uprooted
trees drifted past. Finally, a magician named An-odjium
("Son of the Owl") threw his bow in the water and commanded
the wind to be calm. Then he threw in his earrings, causing
the flood to subside. [Frazer, p.
