On the 17th day of February, in the year 614, it rained
for fourteen days all over the world. The waters rose and
destroyed all living things. Yaitowi, a just and perfect
man who walked with Dios, was saved, along with thirteen
others and eleven women, on the hill of Parbus (today
called Maatale). A few other people, seven birds, seven
asses, and seven little dogs were saved on other mountains.
After the flood, two angels appeared to two of the
survivors, and the angel San Gabriel came, sent by Dios,
telling the people to "go by the way of our Dios and
Father." When they arrived at Venedici, they heard the
voice of Dios, who promised the rainbow as a sign that no
other flood would destroy earth. [Giddings, pp. 106-108]
