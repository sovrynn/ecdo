Half of the land mass Kumari Kandam, which was south of
India, sank in a great flood, destroying the first Tamil
Sangam (literary academy). The people moved to the other
half and established the second Tamil Sangam there, but the
rest of Kumari too sank beneath the sea. The lone survivor
was a Tamil prince named Thirumaaran, who managed to rescue
some Tamil literary classics and swim with them to
present-day Tamil Nadu. [Sundar Narayan, personal
