A great flood came; people survived it on rafts and
canoes. Darkness and high winds came, which scattered the
vessels. When the flood subsided, people landed at the
nearest land and lived where they had landed. Thus they
were scattered all over the world, and when they met again
long afterwards, they were different tribes and spoke
different languages. [Gaster, p.
