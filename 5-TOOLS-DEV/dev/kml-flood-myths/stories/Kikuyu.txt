A beautiful but mysterious woman agreed to marry a man
on the condition that he never ask about her family. He
agreed, and they lived happily together until it was time
for their oldest son's circumcision, and the man asked his
wife why her family couldn't attend the ceremony. With
that, the wife bounced into the air and made a hole seven
miles deep when she landed. She called upon her ancestors,
who came as spirits from Mt. Kenya. The spirits raised a
thunder and hailstorm as they came. They brought food,
goats, cattle, and beer with them and, while the people
took shelter in caves, flooded the countryside with beer,
turning it into a lake. When the spirits left, they took
the couple and their children with them into Mt. Kenya. [Abrahams, pp. 336-338]
