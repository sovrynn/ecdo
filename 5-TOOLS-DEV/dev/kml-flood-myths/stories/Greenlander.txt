The world once overturned. Some people were turned into
fiery spirits; all the rest drowned but one. Afterwards,
the survivor smote the ground with his stick, a woman
sprung out, and the two of them repopulated the world.
Proof of the flood is found in the form of sea fossils on
high mountains. [Gaster, p. 120]
