The people became so numerous that they ate all the fish
and game and started to eat each other. They were so wicked
that Dokibatl, the Changer, flooded the earth. All living
things were destroyed except one woman and one dog, which
survived atop Tacobud (Mt. Ranier). From them the next race
of people were born. They walked on four legs and lived
like animals. To make matters worse, a huge and powerful
bear came from the south. It had the power to paralyze with
its gaze whatever it wanted to eat, and it threatened to
eat all the people. The Changer sent a Spirit Man from the
east to teach them civilization. He showed them how to make
and use bows, canoes, clothing, fire, etc., and taught them
about the spirits and the potlatch custom. He killed the
bear with seven arrows, and he put all the ills of the
world in a large building, but years later a curious
daughter peeked in the building and let them out. [Clark, pp. 136-138]
