During the Dreamtime flood, woramba, the Ark
Gumana carrying Noah, Aborigines, and animals, drifted
south and came to rest in the flood plain of Djilinbadu
(about 70 km south of Noonkanbah Station, just south of the
Barbwire Range and east of the Worral Range), where it can
still be seen today. The white man's claim that it landed
in the Middle East was a lie to keep Aborigines in
subservience. [Kolig, pp. 242-245]
