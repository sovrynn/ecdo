The rivers began flooding. God told two men to go into a
ship, taking with them all sorts of seed and animals. The
flood rose, covering the mountains. Later, to check whether
the waters had dried up, the man sent out a dove, and it
came back to the ship. He waited and sent out a hawk, which
did not return because the waters had dried. The men then
disembarked with the animals and seeds. [Gaster, pp. 120-121]
