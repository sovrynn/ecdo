Two great serpents made the sea rise to determine which
of them had the more powerful magic. The flood came after a
strong earthquake and volcanic eruption. The people took
refuge on a mountain called Thegtheg ("thundering" or
"sparkling") which floated close to the sun. Afterwards,
whenever the Araucanians felt an earthquake, they would
flee to the hills carrying bowls to protect their heads
from the sun's heat. [Vitaliano,
