A great drought dried up all the rivers. The old men
suggested digging in a river bed to find the soul of the
river. After three days of digging, a great spring gushed
forth rapidly enough to kill many of the diggers. While the
Ifugaos celebrated the waters, a storm came, the river kept
rising, and the elders advised people to run for the
mountains, as the river gods were angry. Only two people
made it to safety, a brother and sister, Wigan and Bugan,
on the separate mountains Amuyao and Kalawitan. Both had
enough food on the summits, but only Bugan had fire. After
six months, the waters receded, creating the rugged terrain
that exists today. Wigan traveled to his sister on Mt.
Kalawitan, and they settled in the valley. The sister later
found herself with child and ran away in shame, following
the course of the river. The god Maknongan, appearing as an
old man, assured her that her shame had no foundation,
since she and her brother would repopulate the world. [Demetrio, p. 262; Dixon, pp. 179-180]
Only a brother and sister named Wigam and Bugan survived
a primeval flood, on Mount Amuyas. [Gaster, p. 104]
