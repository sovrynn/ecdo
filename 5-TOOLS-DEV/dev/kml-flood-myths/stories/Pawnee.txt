The first people on the earth were giants, very big and
strong. They did not believe in the creator Ti-ra-wa. They
thought nothing could overcome them. They grew increasingly
worse. At last Ti-ra-wa grew angry and raised the water to
the level of the land so that the ground became soft. The
giants sank into the mud and drowned. Their bones can still
be found today. Ti-ra-wa then created a man and woman, like
people of today, and gave them corn. The Pawnees are
descended from them. [Grinnell, pp.
355-356]
