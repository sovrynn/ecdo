A month before the flood came, the sheep showed much
sadness, watching the stars at night and not eating. Their
shepherd asked what bothered them, and they told him that
the conjunction of stars foretold the destruction of the
world by water. The shepherd and his six children gathered
all the food and sheep they could and took them to the top
of the very tall mountain Ancasmarca. As the flood water
rose, the mountain rose higher, so its top was never
submerged, and the mountain later sank with the water. The
six children repopulated the province after the flood. [Frazer, pp. 270-271]
