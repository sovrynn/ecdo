In olden times before the moon existed, the Muyscas
lived as savages. A bearded old man with the names
Botschika, Nemquetheba, and Zuhe came and taught them
agriculture, crafts, religion, and government. His wife,
with the names Huythaca, Chia, and Yubecayguya, was
beautiful but malicious. To destroy the good works of her
husband, she magically caused the river Funza (Rio Bogota)
to flood the whole Cundinamarca plateau. Only a few people
escaped to the mountain tops. Botschika banished her from
earth and changed her into the moon. Then he opened a pass,
and the water poured down in the Tequendama waterfall,
leaving Lake Guatavita. The country dried and was
cultivated by the survivors. [Kelsen,
p. 140; Vitaliano, pp.
173-175]
Offended by people's wickedness, Chibchachun, the
tutelary god, sent the torrents of Sopo and Tibito down
from the hills, flooding the plain. This made cultivation
impossible and threatened to submerge the people, who had
fled to the mountains. The people appealed to the
culture-hero Bocicha. Appearing as a rainbow, he struck the
mountain with his staff and provided an outlet for the
waters, creating the waterfall of Tequendama. Chibchachun
was driven under the ground and made to hold it up
(replacing the lignum-vitae trees which had held it
before). His restlessness causes earthquakes. The rainbow,
Chuchaviva, was thence honored as a god, but Chibchachum,
in revenge, proclaimed that many would die when it appears.
