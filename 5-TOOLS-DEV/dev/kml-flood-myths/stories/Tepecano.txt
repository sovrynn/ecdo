A man cleared trees every morning and found them regrown
overnight. He spied and found an old man had been doing
this. The old man told him not to work anymore because a
flood was coming, and instead to build an ark and take on
it pairs of all animals, corn, and water. The flood came,
and the ark wandered over the waters for forty days. When
the waters went down, the man returned to work. He soon
noticed that food had been prepared for him when he
returned from work. He spied and found his black bitch had
been turning into the housekeeper. He burned her skin and
soothed her by sprinkling nixtamal water on her.
They lived together and had 24 children. One day the man
took half of them to visit God, who gave them clothes; the
others remained naked. That's why there are rich and poor
people. [Horcasitas, p. 205]
