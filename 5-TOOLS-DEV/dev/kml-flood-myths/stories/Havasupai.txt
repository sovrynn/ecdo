Two brothers fueded, and Hokomata angrily sent a deluge
which destroyed the world. Before it came, though, Tochopa
sealed his daughter Pukeheh in a hollow log. She emerged
when the flood subsided. She bore a son, fathered by the
sun, and a daughter, fathered by a waterfall; these two
repopulated the world. Havasupai women are called
"Daughters of the Water". [Alexander, 1916, p. 180]
