Long ago, a great flood covered the country. All drowned
except a man and two or three women who took refuge on a
mud island near Port Albert. Pelican came by in his canoe
and went to help them. He fell in love with one of the
women. He ferried the others to the mainland, but left her
for last. Afraid of being alone with him, the woman dressed
a log in her opossum rug so it looked like her, left it by
the fire, and swam to the mainland. The pelican returned
and flew into a passion when the log dressed as a woman
wouldn't answer him. He kicked it, which only hurt his foot
and made him angrier. He began to paint himself white so
that he might fight the woman's husband. Another pelican
came up when he was halfway through with these
preparations, but not knowing what to make of the strange
half black and half white creature, pecked him and killed
him. That is why pelicans are now black and white. [Dixon, pp. 279-280; Gaster, pp. 113-114]
