The daughter of Rahaririyoma went to a river to fetch
water. Omauwä (one of the first beings) and his
brother Yoawä found her and copulated with her; then
Omauwä changed the girl's vagina into a mouth with
teeth. Howashiriwä, another of the first beings, then
saw her and seduced her, but her vagina bit off his penis.
Then the son of Omauwä became very thirsty.
Omauwä and Yoawä dug a hole for water, but they
dug so deep that water gushed forth and covered the jungle.
Many drowned. Some of the first beings survived by cutting
down trees and floating on them. This was such a strange
thing to do that they became foreigners and floated away,
and their language gradually became unintelligible. The
Yanomamö survived by climbing mountains, namely Maiyo,
Howashiwä, and Homahewä. Raharariyoma painted red
dots all over her body and plunged into the lake, causing
it to recede. Omauwä then caused her to be changed
into a rahara, a dangerous snake-like monster that
lives in large rivers. Omauwä went downstream and
became an enemy of the Yanomamö, sending them hiccups
and sickness. [Chagnon, pp.
