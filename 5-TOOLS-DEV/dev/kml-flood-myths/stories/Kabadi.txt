Lohero and his brother were angry with their neighbors,
so they put a human bone into a small stream. Soon a great
flood came forth, and the people had to retreat to the
highest peaks until the sea receded. Some people descended,
and others made their homes on the ridges. [Gaster, p. 105; Kelsen, pp. 130-131]
