A buzzard told a man working in the fields not to work
anymore and caused all the trees that had been cut to rise
again. The buzzard told the man to make a box for himself
and take along in it a dog and a chicken. The man survived
the flood in this box. When the waters lowered, the chicken
turned into a buzzard, and the man lived with the dog. The
man found that someone prepared tortillas for him while he
was away at work. One day he returned home and saw the
bitch remove her skin and grind corn. He then burned her
skin. She complained, but she remained a woman, and the two
of them repopulated the world. [Horcasitas, p. 206]
