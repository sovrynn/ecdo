The first people neglected Kuma the creator, so she made
it rain until only one sand dune and one tree stayed above
water. People escaped into the tree, but there were only
leaves and rotten fruit to eat, and when people sat with
their bottoms towards the water, a big fish would come by
and bite them. A few of these people survived as humans,
but Kuma turned the ones that ate leaves and rotten fruit
into howler monkeys. [Brusca &
Wilson, p. "M"]
