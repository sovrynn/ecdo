A giant frog once swallowed all the water, and no one
else could get anything to drink. After many other animals
failed, eel, with his remarkable contortions, made the frog
laugh, releasing the water. Many were drowned in the flood.
The whole of mankind would have perished if the pelican had
not picked up survivors in his canoe. [Roheim, p. 156; Gaster, p. 114]
