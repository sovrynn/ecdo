Three times (every 1200 years), the gods were distressed
by the disturbance from human overpopulation. The gods
dealt with the problem first by plague, then by famine.
Both times, the god Enki advised men to bribe the god
causing the problem. The third time, Enlil advised the gods
to destroy all humans with a flood, but Enki had Atrahasis
build an ark and so escape. Also on the boat were cattle,
wild animals and birds, and Atrahasis' family. When the
storm came, Atrahasis sealed the door with bitumen and cut
the boat's rope. The storm god Adad raged, turning the day
black. After the seven-day flood, the gods regretted their
action. Atrahasis made an offering to them, at which the
gods gathered like flies, and Enki established barren women
and stillbirth to avoid the problem in the future. [Dalley, pp. 23-35]
