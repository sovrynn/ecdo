Some men of Kampong Tudu, looking for wood for a fence,
came upon what seemed to be a great tree trunk lying on the
ground. They began to cut it, but blood came from the cuts,
and, following it to one end, they found it was a giant
snake. They staked it to the ground, killed it, and skinned
it. They went home, feasted on its flesh, and made a great
drum from the skin, but the drum produced no sound. In the
middle of the night, the drum began sounding "Duk Duk Kagu"
on its own. Then a great hurricane came and swept away all
the houses, with the people in them. Some were carried out
to sea; others settled in various places and gave rise to
present villages. [Dixon, p. 181]
