A flood once covered the whole world and drowned
everyone except for one couple, who climbed up a tree on
the highest peak of the Leng hill. In the morning, they
discovered that they had been changed into a tiger and
tigress. Seeing the sad state of the world, Pathian, the
creator, sent a man and a woman from a cave on the hill.
But as they emerged from the cave, they were terrified by
the sight of the tigers. They prayed to the Creator for
strength and killed the beasts. After that, they lived
happily and repopulated the world. [Gaster, p. 97]
