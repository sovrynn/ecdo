The sea rose when the barriers dividing the Black Sea
from the Mediterranean burst, releasing waters from the
Black Sea in a great torrent that washed over part of the
coast of Asia and the lowlands of Samothrace. The survivors
on Samothrace retreated to the mountains and prayed for
deliverance. On being saved, they set up monuments to the
event and built alters on which to continue sacrifices
through the ages. Fishermen still occasionally draw up
parts of stone columns in their nets, signs of cities
drowned in the sea. [Frazer, pp.
167-168]
