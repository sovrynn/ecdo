A great flood once forced the Zunis out of their valley
to take refuge on a nearby tableland. But the flood rose
nearly to the top of the tableland, and the people, fearing
it would drown them all, decided to offer a human sacrifice
to appease the angry waters. A youth and maiden, children
of two Priests of the Rain, were dressed in finery and
thrown into the flood. The waters began subsiding
immediately. The two young people turned to stone; they may
be seen as two great pinnacles rising from the tableland.
