The king of the water demons fell in love with the woman
Ngai-ti (Loved One). She rejected him and ran away. He
pursued and surrounded the whole human race with water on
the hill Phun-lu-buk, said to be in the far northeast.
Threatended by waters which continued to rise, the people
threw Ngai-ti into the flood, which then receded. The
receding water carved great valleys; until then, the earth
had been level. [Gaster, p. 97]
