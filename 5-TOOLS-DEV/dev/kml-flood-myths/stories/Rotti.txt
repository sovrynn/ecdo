In former times, the sea flooded the earth and destroyed
all plants and animals; only the peak of Lakimola remained
above water. A man, with his wife and children, took refuge
there, but the tide kept slowly rising for some months.
They prayed to the sea to return to its old bed. The sea
answered, "I will do so, if you give me an animal whose
hairs I cannot count." A pig, goat, dog, and hen failed
this test, but when the man threw in a cat, the sea sank
abashedly. An osprey appeared and sprinkled some dry earth
on the waters, and the family descended to a new home. The
Lord commanded that the osprey bring all kinds of seed to
the man for him to cultivate. After harvests on Rotti,
people still set up a sheaf of rice as an offering to Mount
Lakimola. [Gaster, p. 103]
