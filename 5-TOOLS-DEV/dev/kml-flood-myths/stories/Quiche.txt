The wooden people, an early version of humanity, were
imperfect because there was nothing in their hearts and
minds, and they did not remember Heart of Sky. So Heart of
Sky destroyed them with a flood. He sent down a black rain
of resin; animals came into their houses and attacked them;
and even pots and stones crushed them. The dogs and turkeys
told them, "You caused us pain, you ate us. Now we eat
you." Their other animals and implements likewise turned on
them. They tried to escape onto their houses, into trees,
and into caves, but the houses collapsed, the trees threw
them off, and the caves slammed shut. Today's monkeys are a
sign of these people, mere manikins. This was before the
sun dawned on the earth. [Tedlock,
p. 83-86]
Some men tried to save themselves from the deluge by
making boxes and going underground in them. God didn't
approve of this and turned them into bees. [Horcasitas, p. 199]
