A medicine man named Sommay had two sons, Tamendonare
and Ariconte. Tamendonare tilled the ground and was a good
husband and father. Ariconte was interested only in war.
One day he returned from battle with the arm of a slain foe
and accused his brother of cowardice. Tamendonare
sarcastically asked why he didn't bring the whole carcass.
Ariconte threw the arm at his brother's door, and at that
moment, their village was transported to the sky, leaving
the two brothers on earth. Tamendonare stamped on the
ground so hard that a fountain of water sprang forth into
the sky; the water continued until the whole world was
covered. The brothers fled to the highest mountains and
climbed trees. Tamendonare climbed a pindona tree,
helping one of his wives up with him, and Ariconte climbed
a geniper tree with his wife. All other people
drowned. Ariconte's wife dropped fruit and heard from the
splash when the water was still too high for them to climb
down. Two different peoples, who are perpetually feuding,
are descended from these two couples. The Tupinambo exalt
themselves over the Tominu by claiming descent from
Tamendonare. [Frazer, pp.
254-255]
The great god Tupi warned a medicine man named
Tamanduare of a coming great flood that would cover the
earth, and he told Tamanduare to seek refuge on a lofty
peak with a palm tree at its top. Tamanduare and his family
went there immediately, and when they arrived, it began to
rain. It continued to rain until the whole earth was
flooded. The water covered even the summit of the mountain,
and Tamanduare and his family climbed into the palm tree
and live there, eating its fruit, until the water subsided.
Then they descended and repopulated the devastated world.
