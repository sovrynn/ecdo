Oye, Coyote-man, and Wekwek, Falcon-man, quarreled. Oye
took all the people with him across the ocean and made rain
to cover the world with water. Wekwek flew and flew but
could find no place to rest. The water covered everything.
Finally he fell in the water. He was floating nearly dead
when his wing caught on a stick. The stick was from the
roundhouse of Peleet the Grebe, who investigated and found
Wekwek. He pulled Wekwek into his roundhouse and saved him.
Oye let the water down and brought the people back. [Merriam, p. 157]
