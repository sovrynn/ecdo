A man was surprised to find his fields overgrown after
clearing them the previous day. He spied and found a monkey
was responsible. The monkey told him that God didn't want
him to work because a flood was coming, and it gave him
instructions for building a coffinlike craft. The man built
the box and got into it, and when the flood came, the
monkey rode atop it. When the flood subsided, the man got
out and built a fire to cook some fish he found. But the
Almighty, irritated with him for building the fire,
appeared and turned him into a monkey. [Horcasitas, p. 198]
