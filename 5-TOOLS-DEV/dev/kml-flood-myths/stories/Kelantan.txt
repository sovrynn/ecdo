One day a feast was made for a circumcision, during
which all manner of beasts were pitted to fight one
another. The last fight was between dogs and cats. During
this fight, a great flood came down from the mountains,
drowning everyone except two or three menials who had been
sent to the hills to gather firewood. Then the sun, moon,
and stars were extinguished. When light returned, there was
no land, and all the abodes of men had been overwhelmed.
