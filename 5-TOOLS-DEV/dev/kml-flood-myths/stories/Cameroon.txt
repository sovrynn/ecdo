As a girl was grinding flour, a goat came to lick it.
She first drove it away, but when it came back, she allowed
it to lick as much as it could. In return for the kindness,
the goat told her there will be a flood that day and
advised her and her brother to run elsewhere immediately.
They escaped with a few belongings and looked back to see
water covering their village. After the flood, they lived
on their own for many years, unable to find mates. The goat
reappeared and said they could marry themselves, but they
would have to put a hoe-handle and a clay pot with a broken
bottom on their roof to signify that they are relatives.
