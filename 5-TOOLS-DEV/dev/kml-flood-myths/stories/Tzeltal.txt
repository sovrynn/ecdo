Through a misunderstanding, a wife killed and cooked her
child. She and her husband ate it and enjoyed it, and soon
everyone was killing and cooking children. God became angry
and sent a deluge. One intelligent man survived in a canoe.
Right after the flood, he lit a fire, and God smelled the
smoke. God sent the buzzard, turkey buzzard, and churn-owl
to investigate, but they stayed to eat dead bodies. God
condemned them always to eat dead bodies. God then sent the
hawk, which reported back. The man was turned into a
monkey. [Horcasitas, p. 198]
The Padre Santo warned two brothers that a flood was
coming, and they, with many animals, survived in an ark.
When the waters were subsiding, the younger brother fell
out of the ark, landed in a tree, and turned into a monkey.
