Tahiti was destroyed by the sea. Even the trees and
stones were carried away by the wind. But two people were
saved. The wife took up her young chicken, her young dog,
and her kitten, and the husband took up his young pig. The
husband said they should escape to Mount Orofena, but the
wife said (correctly) that the flood would reach even
there, and they should go to Mount Pita-hiti instead, which
they did. They watched ten nights till the sea ebbed. The
land, though, remained without produce, and the fish in the
rock crevices were putrid. When the wind died away, stones
and trees began to fall from the heavens, where the winds
had carried them. To escape this new danger, the couple dug
a hole, lined it with grass, and covered it over with
stones and earth. They crept inside and listened to the
terrible crash of the falling stones. By and by, the
falling stones stopped, but to be safe they waited another
night before coming out. The land they found was desolated.
The woman brought forth two children, a son and a daughter,
but grieved about the lack of food. Again the mother
brought forth, but still there was no food. Then in three
days all the trees bore fruit. All people are descended
from that couple. [Gaster, pp.

The Supreme God was angry and dragged the earth through
the sea. By a happy chance, the island of Tahiti broke off
and was preserved. [H. Miller, p.
