A Murato was fishing in a lagoon of the Pastaza River
when a small crocodile swallowed his bait. The fisherman
killed it. The mother of crocodiles was angered and lashed
the water with her tail, which flooded the area and drowned
all people except one man, who climbed a palm tree. It was
dark as night, so he dropped a palm fruit from time to
time. When he heard it thud on ground rather than splash,
he knew the flood had subsided. He climbed down, built a
house, and began tilling a field. Being alone, he cut off a
piece of his flesh and planted it; from this grew a woman,
whom he married. [Frazer, pp.
