The sun and moon are man and wife, and their best friend
was flood, whom they often visited. They often invited
flood to visit them, but he demurred, saying their house
was too small. Sun and moon built a much larger house, and
flood could no longer refuse their invitation. He arrived
and asked, "Shall I come in?" and was invited in. When
flood was knee-deep in the house, he asked if he should
continue coming and was again invited to do so. The flood
brought many relatives, including fish and sea beasts. Soon
he rose to the ceiling of the house, and the sun and moon
went onto the roof. The flood kept rising, submerging the
house entirely, and the sun and moon made a new home in the
sky. [Eliot, pp. 47-48]
