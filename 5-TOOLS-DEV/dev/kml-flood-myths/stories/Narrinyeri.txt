A man's two wives ran away from him. He pursued them to
Encounter Bay, saw them at a distance, and angrily cried
out for the waters to rise and drown them. A terrible flood
washed over the hills and killed the two women. The waters
rose so high that a man named Nepelle, who lived at
Rauwoke, had to drag his canoe to the top of the hill now
called Point Macleay. The dense part of the Milky Way shows
his canoe floating in the sky. [Frazer, p. 236]
