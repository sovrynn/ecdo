Masmasalanich, who created man, fastened the earth to
the sun to keep the earth from sinking and to keep the sun
at the proper distance. One day he stretched the rope, so
the earth sank and the water ran over it, eventually
covering even the tops of the mountains. A fierce storm
broke out at the same time. Many people who had taken to
boats were drowned in the storm, and others were driven far
away. At last Masmasalanich shortened the rope, the earth
rose again from the water, and mankind spread over it.
Diversity of language arose from their being scattered;
there was but one speech before the flood. [Frazer, p. 320]
