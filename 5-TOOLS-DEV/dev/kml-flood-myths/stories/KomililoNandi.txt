Ilet, the spirit of lightning, came to live, in human
form, in a cave high on the mountain named Tinderet. When
he did so, it rained incessantly and killed most of the
hunters living in the forest below. Some hunters, searching
for the cause of the rain, found him and wounded him with
poison arrows. Ilet fled and died in a neighboring country.
When he died, the rain stopped. [Kelsen, p. 137]
