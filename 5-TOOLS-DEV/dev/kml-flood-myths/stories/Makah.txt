The ocean rose high enough to cut off the cape. Then it
withdrew, reaching its low ebb four days later, leaving
Neah Bay high and dry. Then it rose again to cover all but
the mountain tops. The rising waters were very warm. People
with canoes loaded their belongings and were borne far to
the north. Many died when their canoes were caught in
trees. The sea returned to normal after four more days, and
the people found themselves far to the north, where their
descendants still live. [Vitaliano, pp. 171-172]
