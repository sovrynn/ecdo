A flood overflowed the land. An old man and his family,
on a boat or raft, were blown by the wind to a certain
mountain. He stayed there and sent a crow to search for
land, but it returned without finding any. Later, it
brought back a leaf from a certain grove, and the old man
knew the water was abating. [Frazer,
pp. 324-325]
