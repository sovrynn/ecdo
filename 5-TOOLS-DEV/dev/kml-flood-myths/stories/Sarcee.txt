The world was flooded, and one man and one woman
survived on a raft on which they collected all kinds of
animals and birds. The man sent a beaver (or, some say, a
muskrat) diving to the bottom, and it brought up a little
mud. The man shaped this to form a new world. It was at
first so small that a little bird could walk around it, but
it grew and grew. [Frazer, pp.
314-315]
