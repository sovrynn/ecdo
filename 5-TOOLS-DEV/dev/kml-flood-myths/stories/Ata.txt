Water covered the whole earth, and all the Atás
drowned except two men and a woman who were carried far to
sea. They would have perished, but a great eagle offered to
carry them on its back to their homes. One man refused, but
the other two people accepted and returned to Mapula. [Gaster, pp. 103-104]
