Rainbow does not like menstruating women to enter the
water, or even to drink from it. One day a young woman
broke this taboo because her mother and sisters didn't
leave her any drinking water when they left for the day.
Driven by thirst, she went to the lagoon. When she had
returned, Rainbow, full of anger, caused a strong wind,
accompanied by whirlwinds and heavy rain. All were drowned
in the ensuing flood. [Bierhorst, 1988, pp. 142-143]
