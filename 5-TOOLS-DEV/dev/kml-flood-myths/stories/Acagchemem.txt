The descendants of Captain Ouiot asked Chinigchinich for
vengeance upon their chief. Chinigchinich appeared to them
and told them that those of them with the power to cause
rain were the once to achieve vengeance by inundating the
earth and so destroying every living thing. The rains came;
the sea swelled in over the earth, covering all the land
except a high mountain, where a few people had gone with
the person who caused the rain with songs of supplication
to Chinigchinich to drown their enemies. Every other animal
on earth was destroyed. If their enemies heard them, they
sang other songs saying that they were not afraid because
Chinigchinich will not destroy the world with another
inundation. [Frazer, p. 288]
