Two brother escaped a great flood on top of the tall
mountain Huaca-y単an. As the water rose, the mountain
also rose. When the water lowered and their provisions were
consumed, the brother descended, built a small house, and
ate herbs and roots, living a miserable existence of hunger
and toil. One day, they returned home to find food and
chicha drink prepared. After ten days of this, to
find out who their benefactor was, the elder brother hid
and presently saw two macaws, dressed like Ca単aris,
enter the house and begin to prepare food they had brought
with them. The man saw that they were beautiful and had
faces of women, and he came out of hiding. But the birds
became angry and left when they saw him, leaving no food.
The younger brother came home and heard the story, and both
were angry. The next day, the younger brother decided to
hide. After three days, the macaws returned. The two men
waited until the birds had finished cooking and then shut
the door. The birds were angry, and the larger one escaped
as the brothers held the small one. The brothers took the
macaw as a wife; by her they had six sons and daughters,
from whom the Ca単ari are descended. Macaws and the
hill Huaca-y単an are venerated by the Indians today.
