The mountains quarrelled over which of them was the
highest. In vexation, their great ancestor Baluga Luomewona
caused the oceans to rise by throwing into a sea a comb
which became a giant crab which stopped up the ocean's
outlet sluices. The water rose to cover all but the tops of
two or three mountains. The people who had escaped to these
mountains with their cattle survived. [Kelsen, p. 133, Gaster, p. 100; Dixon, pp. 181-182]
