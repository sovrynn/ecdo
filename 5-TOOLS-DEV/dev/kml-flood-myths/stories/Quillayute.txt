Thunderbird was once so angry that he sent the ocean
over the land. When it reached the village of the
Quillayute, they got into their canoes. The water rose for
four days, covering the mountains. The boats were scattered
by the wind and waves. Then the water receded for four
days, and people settled in many areas. [Clark, p. 45]
