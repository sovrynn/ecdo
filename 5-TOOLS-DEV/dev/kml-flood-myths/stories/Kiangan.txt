Wigan's first son Kabigat went from Hudog (the Sky
World) to Earth World to hunt with his dogs, but the earth
was then entirely flat, causing no echoes by which he could
hear his dogs barking. He mused a while, went to the Sky
World, and came back with a large cloth with which he
closed the exit of the rivers to the sea. He returned to
Hudog and told Bongabong what he had done. Bongabong had
Cloud and Fog go to the house of Baiyuhibi, and Baiyuhibi
brought together his sons and bade them rain for three
days, stopping finally when Bongabong commanded. Wigan told
Kabigat to remove the stopper. When he did so, the waters
which covered the earth formed mountains and valleys as
they rushed out. Bongabong called on Mumba'an to dry the
earth. [Dixon, pp. 178-179]
