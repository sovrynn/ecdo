The good spirit Makunaima ("He who works in the night")
created the heaven and earth. When he had created plants
and trees, he came down from his heavenly mansion, climbed
a tree, and chipped off bark with a large stone axe. The
chips turned into animals of all kinds when they fell into
the river at the base of the tree. Next, Makunaima created
man, and after the man had fallen asleep, he awoke to find
a woman beside him. Later the evil spirit got more power on
earth, so Makunaima sent a great flood. Only one man
survived in a canoe. He sent a rat to see whether the flood
had abated, and the rat returned with a cob of maize. When
the flood had subsided, the man threw stones behind him,
which became other people. [Frazer,
