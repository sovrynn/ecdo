A boy and girl were born to the first man and woman. God
sent a deluge to destroy a jackal which had angered him.
The man and woman heard it coming, so they shut their
children in a hollow piece of wood with provisions to last
until the flood subsides. The deluge came, and everything
on earth was drowned. After twelve years, God created two
birds and sent them to see if the jackal had been drowned.
They saw nothing but a floating log and, landing on it,
heard the children inside, who were saying to each other
that they had only three days of provisions left. The birds
told God, who caused the flood to subside, took the
children from the log, and heard their story. In due time
they were married. God gave each of their children the name
of a different caste, and all people are descended from
them. [Gaster, p. 96]
