The flood was sent by the god Laxha, who had become
annoyed by the noise of boys at play. [Gaster, p. 119]
All people except for a few were destroyed by a flood,
which was sent by heaven to punish man's ill behavior.
Later, people were devastated by fire. The earth had no
mountains or trees before the flood. Leqa created them
after the deluge. [Frazer, p.
319]
Long ago the waters swelled. A few people escaped to the
tops of high mountains, but more were saved in their
canoes. They were scattered and, when the waters went down,
they landed and settled in various spots. Thus Indians are
spread all over the country, but their common songs and
customs show that they are one people. [Frazer, p. 320]
