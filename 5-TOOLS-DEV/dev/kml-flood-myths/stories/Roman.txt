Jupiter, angered at the evil ways of humanity, resolved
to destroy it. He was about to set the earth to burning,
but considered that that might set heaven itself afire, so
he decided to flood the earth instead. With Neptune's help,
he caused storm and earthquake to flood everything but the
summit of Parnassus, where Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha
came by boat and found refuge. Recognizing their piety,
Jupiter let them live and withdrew the flood. Deucalion and
Pyrrha, at the advice of an oracle, repopulated the world
by throwing "your mother's bones" (stones) behind them;
each stone became a person. [Ovid, 
book

Jupiter and Mercury, traveling incognito in Phrygia,
begged for food and shelter, but found all doors closed to
them until they received hospitality from Philemon and
Baucis. The gods revealed their identity, led the couple up
the mountains, and showed them the whole valley flooded,
destroying all homes but the couple's, which was
transformed into a marble temple. Given a wish, the couple
asked to be priest and priestess of the temple, and to die
together. In their extreme old age, they changed into an
oak and lime tree. [Ovid, 
book 8]
One of the kings of Alba (named Romulus, Remulus, or
Amulius Silvius), set himself up as a god equal to or
superior to Jupiter. He made machines to mimic thunder and
lightning, and he ordered his soldiers to drown out real
thunder by beating on their shields. For his impiety, he
and his house were destroyed by a thunderbolt in a fierce
storm. The Alban lake rose and drowned his palace. You may
still see the ruins when the lake is clear and calm. [Frazer 1993, p. 149]
