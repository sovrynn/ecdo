When the flood waters began to rise, a man named Tezpi
entered into a great vessel, taking with him his wife and
children and diverse seeds and animals. When the waters
abated, the man sent out a vulture, but the bird found
plenty of corpses to eat and didn't return. Other birds
also flew away and didn't return. Finally, he sent out a
hummingbird, which returned with a green bough in its beak.
