People dividing fish always gave the man Crow the poor
quality ones. Crow cut down a big paperbark tree, which
fell across a creek. Crow sat on the tree crying out,
"Waag. . . Waag!" As he did, the creek grew wider and
wider, dividing the island into two islands. Crow turned
into a bird and flew over the people. The splash from the
tree caused the water to rise, and the people, who were all
on the bank of the creek, all drowned. On hearing what
happened, Blanket Lizard swam towards South Goulburn Island
in search of his wife, but halfway across he drowned and
turned into a reef. [Berndt &
Berndt, p. 40]
