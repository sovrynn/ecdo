Once upon a time, people heard a rumbling above and
below the ground; the sun and moon turned red, blue, and
yellow; and wild beasts mingled fearlessly with man. A
month later, they saw darkness ascending from the earth to
the sky, accompanied by a roar and by thunder and heavy
rain. Everything was in dreadful confusion. Some people
lost themselves. Some died without knowing why. The water
rose to cover the earth, and people took refuge in the
highest trees. There they perished from cold and hunger,
for it continued to be dark and rainy. Only Uassu and his
wife survived. When they came down after the flood, they
could not find even a sign of a single corpse. They had
many children. Today, the Pamarys build their houses on the
river, so that when the water rises, they may rise with it.
