An old lady, weary and covered with sores, arrived in a
town called Sonanzenzi and sought hospitality, which was
denied her at all homes but the last she came to. When she
was well and ready to depart, she told her friends to pack
up and leave with her, as the place was accursed and would
be destroyed by Nzambi. The night after they had left,
heavy rains came and turned the valley into a lake,
drowning all the inhabitants of the town. The sticks of the
houses can still be seen deep in the lake. [Feldmann, p. 50; Kelsen, p. 137]
