Allah sent Noah to warn the people to serve none but
Allah, but most of them would not listen. They challenged
Noah to make good his threats and mocked him when, under
Allah's inspiration, he built a ship. Allah told Noah not
to speak to Him on behalf of wrongdoers; they would be
drowned. In time, water gushed from underground and fell
from the sky. Noah loaded onto his ship pairs of all kinds,
his household, and those few who believed. One of Noah's
sons didn't believe and said he would seek safety in the
mountains. He was among the drowned. The ship sailed amid
great waves. Allah commanded the earth to swallow the water
and the sky to clear, and the ship came to rest on Al-Judi.
Noah complained to Allah for taking his son. Allah
admonished that the son was an evildoer and not of Noah's
household, and Noah prayed for forgiveness. Allah told Noah
to go with blessings on him and on some nations that will
arise from those with him. [Koran
11:25-48]
