The earth was once well populated, when mankind
committed a magical fault for which they were punished by a
great deluge. The Mixtec people descended from the few
survivors. [Horcasitas, p.
192]
The god and goddess Puma-Snake and Jaguar-Snake raised a
cliff above the abyss. Here they lived many centuries and
raised two boys who had the power to transform themselves
into eagles and serpents. The brothers established farming
and sacrifice and penance; at their prayers, light appeared
and water separated from earth. The earth was peopled, but
a flood destroyed them, and Creator-of-All-Things restored
the world. [Alexander, 1920,
p. 87]
