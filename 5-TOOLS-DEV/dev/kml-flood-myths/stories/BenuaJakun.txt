The ground we stand on is merely a skin covering an
abyss of water. Long ago, Pirman, the deity, broke up this
skin, flooding and destroying the world. However, Pirman
had created a man and woman and placed them in a completely
closed ship of pulai wood. When at last this ship
came to rest, the couple nibbled their way out through its
side, and they saw land stretching to the horizon in all
directions. The sun had not yet been created, so it was
dark; when it grew light, they saw seven small rhododendron
shrubs and seven clumps of sambau grass. The couple
bemoaned their lack of children, but in time the woman
conceived in the calves of her legs, a male child coming
from the right calf and a female from the left. That is why
offspring from the same womb may not marry. All mankind are
descended from that first pair. [Gaster, p. 99]
