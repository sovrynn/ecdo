Since its creation, the world has been destroyed twice,
once by fire and once by flood, by the great god Aiomun
Kondi because of the wickedness of mankind. The pious and
wise chief Marerewana was informed of the coming of the
flood and saved himself and his family in a large canoe. He
tied the canoe to a tree with a long cable of bushrope to
prevent drifting too far from his old home. [Gaster, p. 126]
