One of the Tezcatlipocas (sons of the original
dual god) transformed himself into the Sun and created the
first humans to show up his brothers. The other gods, angry
at his audacity, had Quetzalcoatl destroy the sun and the
earth, which he did with a flood. The people became fish.
This ended the first age. The second, third, and fourth
Suns ended, respectively, with the crumbling of the
heavens, a rain of fire, and devastating winds. [Leon-Portilla, p. 450]
