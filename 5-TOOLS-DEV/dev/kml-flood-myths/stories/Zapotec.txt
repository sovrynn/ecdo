The Angel Gabriel warned Noéh that a flood was
coming because of mankind's sins. Noéh warned other
people, but they didn't believe him. He built an ark and
took pairs of all animals. The waters came; the Archangel
Saint Michael blew his trumpet. When the waters receded,
Noéh sent out a buzzard to see if the world was dry,
but it stayed out to eat dead animals. The crow was then
sent; it returned to say that the world was drying. Then
the turtledove and parroquet went and reported back that
the world was dry, and Noéh and the animals left the
ark. The buzzard became ugly because of his actions, and
the trip of a person unmindful of his mission is called a
"buzzard's trip." Petela, a great Zapotec chieftain of
Ocelotepeque, was descended from the survivors of the
flood. [Horcasitas, p.
192,213]
In another version, the buzzard stayed to eat the dead
and was condemned to be a scavenger. A heron was sent next,
fulfilled its mission, and was allowed to eat fish as a
reward. A raven was sent, and its obedience was rewarded by
permitting it to eat fruit and corn. A dove then went and
reported that the earth was almost dry, and it was granted
freedom. [Horcasitas, p. 212]
The earth was dark and cold. The only inhabitants were
giants, and God was angry with them for their idolatry.
Some giants, feeling that a flood was coming, carved
underground houses for themselves out of great slabs of
rock. Some thus escaped destruction and may still be found
hidden in certain caverns. Other giants hid in the forests
and became monkeys. [Horcasitas,
p. 199]
