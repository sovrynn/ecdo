# Fluid Simulation

## Fluid Sim Software

### CPU-based:
- Splishsplash: https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH
- MESHFREE: https://www.meshfree.eu/

### GPU based:
- Fast Fluid Simulations with Sparse Volumes on the GPU: https://people.csail.mit.edu/kuiwu/gvdb_sim.html

You've also got Genesis: https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis
- The Genesis project, a collaborative effort by over 20 research labs over 24 months, has introduced a revolutionary open-source generative physics engine. This engine is designed for robotics and AI, capable of simulating dynamic 4D worlds with real physics at speeds up to 430,000 times faster than real-time on an RTX 4090 GPU. Key features include simulation of diverse materials, generation of photorealistic visuals, and the creation of training data for robots, all facilitated by its Python-based architecture which outperforms existing GPU-accelerated solutions. Genesis allows for the rapid training of robotic skills, potentially transforming the fields of robotics and physical AI by providing an accessible platform for simulation and data generation.

## Steven Ward simulations

Steven Ward:

In Steven Ward there is a curiosity : He stopped Earth's rotation here https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~ward/global%20tsunami(HD).mov

Interestingly, what he is modeling here would possibly be even more devastating than the rotation we are looking at (depending on how quickly it stops in his model). With the ECDO rotation, a great deal of the land masses 'get out of the way' so to speak.
