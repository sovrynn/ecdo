- The Genesis project, a collaborative effort by over 20 research labs over 24 months, has introduced a revolutionary open-source generative physics engine. This engine is designed for robotics and AI, capable of simulating dynamic 4D worlds with real physics at speeds up to 430,000 times faster than real-time on an RTX 4090 GPU. Key features include simulation of diverse materials, generation of photorealistic visuals, and the creation of training data for robots, all facilitated by its Python-based architecture which outperforms existing GPU-accelerated solutions. Genesis allows for the rapid training of robotic skills, potentially transforming the fields of robotics and physical AI by providing an accessible platform for simulation and data generation.
