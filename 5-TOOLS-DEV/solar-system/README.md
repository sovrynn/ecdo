# Solar System

Ephemeris and Stellarium the go-tos for cosmic calculations AFAIK.

JPL's Ephemeris software: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html

## Solar system

Solar system simulators:
- Radially uniform orbits, changing dates only seems to work on mobile: https://www.theplanetstoday.com/
- Real scale orbits: https://theskylive.com

NASA solar system simulator: https://science.nasa.gov/eyes/

- Celestia is great for large-scale models.
- Stellarium is great for ground-based observations.
- https://solarsystemscope.com good online resources
- https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons is the go to for the best ephemeris data (used in many of these models, I'm sure).

You might enjoy this fun visualizing tool.  This Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool displays Keplerian and perturbed orbits of NEOs (including Encke).  Not sure if this link will work, but give it a try: https://neotools.ssa.esa.int/sovt?c=MTA3OQ==

Site to look at discovered planetary formation instead of having to plug it into a stellar calendar: https://starwalk.space/en/news/what-is-planet-parade#when-will-5-to-7-planets-align-in-the-sky

### The EUHFORIA model has been...

The EUHFORIA model has been updated to include this X4.5 (the bulk of which should start arriving over the next few hours). [1] https://t.co/aWtRZuo9ds https://t.co/GqWr6z92bY
