# 3D Mass Models of Earth's Inner Layers

There are several 3D mass models of Earth's inner layers, including the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. These models are used in geophysics, seismology, and planetary science to study Earth's internal structure, density variations, and geodynamic processes.

## **Types of 3D Mass Models**
### **1. Seismic Tomography Models**
These models use seismic wave velocities to infer density variations within Earth's interior.

- **PREM (Preliminary Reference Earth Model)** – A widely used 1D model but often extended into 3D.
- **LLNL-G3Dv3** – A 3D global seismic model.
- **GyPSuM (Global Lithosphere & Mantle Model)** – Incorporates temperature and composition.
- **SAW642AN, S40RTS, SEMUCB-WM1** – High-resolution seismic tomography models.

### **2. Geodynamic Models**
These models simulate mantle convection and core-mantle interactions based on density and heat flow.

- Used to understand plate tectonics, mantle plumes, and subduction zones.

### **3. Crustal and Lithospheric Models**
- **CRUST1.0** – A detailed model of Earth's crustal thickness.
- **Litho1.0** – Extends CRUST1.0 to include lithospheric structure.
