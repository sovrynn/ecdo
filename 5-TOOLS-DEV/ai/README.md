You don't necessarily need an ECDO-trained LLM to do translations, as you can either generate or write a summary in English, and then feed it into an ECDO-unfamiliar LLM and ask it to translate it.

## Preexisting ECDO LLMs

- ECDO v1 (Sep 16, 2024): https://chatgpt.com/g/g-7TBwEWlWT-ecdo-v1
- Custom GPT (outdated): https://chatgpt.com/g/g-B3wax7hqy-ecdo-zone-safety-analyst
	- All ECDO content pasted in as text or uploaded as file
	- After uploading more than 15-20 documents the GPT started to give errors and the process had to be restarted
	- Useful for an overview of the theory and the possible safe zones, but still better to read the original content for proper understanding
