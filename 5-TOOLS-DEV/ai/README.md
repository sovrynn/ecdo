You don't necessarily need an ECDO-trained LLM to do translations, as you can either generate or write a summary in English, and then feed it into an ECDO-unfamiliar LLM and ask it to translate it.

## Preexisting ECDO LLMs

1. ECDO v1 textual model (updated Sep 25, 2024): https://chatgpt.com/g/g-7TBwEWlWT-ecdo-v1
2. Edgar's model (Oldest, updated Sep 16, 2024): https://chatgpt.com/g/g-B3wax7hqy-ecdo-zone-safety-analyst
	- All ECDO content pasted in as text or uploaded as file
	- After uploading more than 15-20 documents the GPT started to give errors and the process had to be restarted
	- Useful for an overview of the theory and the possible safe zones, but still better to read the original content for proper understanding

## Sample ECDO v1 textual model response

Prompt: Why does the ECDO happen?

The Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling Oscillation (ECDO) occurs due to a complex set of geophysical processes that lead to the decoupling of the Earth's mantle from its core. This phenomenon is hypothesized to be driven by the following key factors:

Core-Mantle Heat Transfer: The Earth's core releases heat into the mantle, which can cause significant temperature anomalies. This process contributes to the weakening of the magnetic coupling between the core and the mantle, a key factor in initiating the decoupling.

Magnetic Moment Reduction: A decrease in the Earth's geomagnetic moment, particularly the weakening of the magnetic field, is suggested to play a critical role in allowing the mantle to decouple from the core.

Gyroscopic Forces: The ECDO theory also involves gyroscopic forces, where the Earth's mantle begins to rotate independently of the core once a critical threshold is reached. This rotation is mediated by the gyroscopic effect, potentially leading to a Dzhanibekov-like oscillation in the Earth's rotation.

Geological and Electromagnetic Disruptions: Leading up to the decoupling, there are expected to be significant geological and electromagnetic disturbances, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and extreme weather events. These are thought to be precursors to the decoupling event.

Critical Points: The theory also posits specific "points" or stages in this process, such as the "Indigo Point," where the core-mantle coupling weakens, and the "Tau Point," where the decoupling occurs, leading to significant rotational changes in the Earth's mantle and crust .

In summary, the ECDO is theorized to result from the complex interaction of thermal, magnetic, and rotational dynamics within the Earth, ultimately leading to a catastrophic decoupling event.
