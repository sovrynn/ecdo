# Prepping for an ECDO event

This directory is for all things prepping (except location mapping, which belongs in `LOCATION-MAPPING`).

How does one actually prepare, in meatspace, for an ECDO event? How does one protect themselves from physical dangers other than flooding? What materials, tools, and plans should one prepare to survive during and after an ECDO event? These are the questions this directory aims to answer.

## TODO Dangers to consider

Natural:
- From the land below:
	- Earthquakes
	- Volcanoes
- Falling, flying things:
	- Landslides
	- Avalanches
	- Fast winds
- Temperature, atmosphere:
	- Freezing temperature
	- Supernova (solar heat wave)
	- Ash from volcanoes covering air, blocking Sun

Basic biological needs:
- food
- water
- shelter
- community

Human safety and security needs:
- weapons
- cultural differences, local community states, local attitudes

Geopolitical:
- geopolitical wargaming

## Nobulart Recommendations

Stay away from any built up structures (ie towns) and look for high open ground (like a hilltop) which also provides solid shelter on the SW side of the summit. The wind could theoretically be coming from the NE as the rotation unfolds, but strength would vary. Once the rotatino completes, the ocean will return from the SW, probably some 12-24 hours after the initial revolution. This is the first seiche, and it may well inundate several hundred kilometers inland. There would be several more of these over the next weeks as the oceans continue to settle.

Locations 2000m-2500m above sea level, above bedrock
