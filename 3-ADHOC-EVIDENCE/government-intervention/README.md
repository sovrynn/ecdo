# News

At one of the scientific meetings that Major White attended in the Pentagon in early 1948, the scientists discussed the advisability of alerting the public to the pending polar-flip phenomenon.

Its a progressive, electromagnetically interfaced heating event [1]. What if we could somehow retard the process by intervening in the earth-solar coupling [2], and perhaps even the core-mantle coupling through the application of magnetohydrodynamics with the objective of influencing magma viscosity?

Well, well, well... With the exception of the four colliders in India, the remainder of the 30+ colliders worldwide are all clustered near to the meridians of the ECDO pivots and the rotational meridian. Coincidence, or a tripolar phased array? [1] https://mit.edu/~wqm/Papers/Malik_TripolarAntenna.pdf

Neutrino Detectors.
[1] University of Wisconsin-Madison seal. Numen Lumen = Divine Light. Nice eye. [2][3] The Antarctic IceCube Neutron Observatory, commissioned in 2010. A joint UWM/CERN experiment. [4] Clustering of existing and planned neutrino detectors is near the ECDO pivot and 31E meridians. Neither IceCube nor it's predecessor (AMANDA) are mentioned anywhere in the 2023 paper Neutrino Geoscience: Review, Survey, Future Prospects by McDonough and Watanabe, from which the map is drawn, nor anywhere in the 275 page parent publication, Core-Mantle Co-Evolution An Interdisciplinary Approach (2023), which occurred to me as a little odd.

The detectors are, I believe, what they're claimed to be, but could possibly fulfill other unknown functions. Within the context of an ECDO event, they are part of the early warning system, and could possibly be working in tandem with the similarly clustered colliders, as a core-mantle control (Colliders) and feedback monitoring system (Detectors). The entire system together is a modern day technological equivalent of the Great Pyramid.
