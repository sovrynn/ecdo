# Research Papers about ECDO

## Paper 1

This paper is describing something which sounds remarkably similar to an ECDO state 2 to state 1 rotation a half a billion years ago:

"..at least two tectonic plates, involving more than two-thirds of Earth's continental lithosphere, were involved in a rapid rotation of ~90째 relative to the spin axis. We speculate that the entire lithosphere may have been involved in this rotation. // The new ages, along with paleomagnetic data, indicate that continents moved at rapid rates that are difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of mantle dynamics.."

(continued...) "// The pole for this sequence is >80째 away from the Vendian-Early Cambrian poles, implying that Australia underwent a large rotation while remaining near the equator sometime between Tommotian and Late Cambrian time. // Australia rotated counterclockwise during this time. // Antarctica, India, Africa, South America, and perhaps parts of East Asia also rotated with Australia. // True polar wander (TPW) is the process through which quasi-rigid spheroids align their maximum moments of inertia with the spin axis, pushing positive mass anomalies toward the rotational equator. // A variant of this mechanism, inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW), involves discrete bursts of TPW of up to 90째 in geologically short intervals of time if the magnitudes of the intermediate and maximum moments of inertia cross. This would result in a rapid movement away from the spin axis by the geographic location of the former pole with rotation of the entire solid Earth centered about the minimum moment of inertia located on the equator. // These two poles, with their stated polarity interpretation, are separated by about 68째; together they yield a plausible tropical position for Siberia, nearly on the opposite side of the globe from Australia. // If the velocities are due to TPW, however, such geodynamical considerations are obviated because the entire mantle would have rotated along with the lithosphere."
