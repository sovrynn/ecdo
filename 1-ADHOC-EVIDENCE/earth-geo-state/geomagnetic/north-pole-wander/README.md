Courtesy of NOAA, showing that that the Np has traversed more in the past 25 years than it did in the 400 years before that. Sp is more consistent, but has similarly covered over 2000km headed in pretty much one direction.

## 1840 - 2019 Magnetic North Pole Wander Video

Video at `img/npw.mp4`. It is an excellent visualization, compiled from historic observational and SWARM data. Note the apparent >270Â° deviation that occurred in the mid-1800's.
