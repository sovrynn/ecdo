## El Nino 3700 year history

"The seasonal variation 3700 years ago was slightly lower than that suggested by modern instrumental data, and the transition between warm and cold seasons was rapid. Higher amplitudes of reconstructed r-monthly and r-annual SST anomalies imply an enhanced climate variability during this warm period. Investigation of the El Ninõ–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation (based on the reconstructed SST series) indicates reduced ENSO frequency but increased ENSO-related variability and extreme El Ninõ winter events 3700 years ago."

## Peltier Effect

What could cause the the dramatic shift from bolling allerod to younger dryas where the warm and cooler hemispheres swapped places so rapidly, perhaps a poleshift?

Could this also be an instance of the Peltier Effect?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect

## Bolling-Allerod

Younger Dryas coincides with the start of this period?

## Temperature

![temperature](img/temperature-3700.jpg "temperature")

Any theories as to why the temperature fluctuations were much more severe prior to 8000BC?

Because the first event was the result of a collision or encounter with a comet or other body/bodies.

## 18.5k year climate cycles?

An 18.5ky precessional supercycle which modulates long term climate.
