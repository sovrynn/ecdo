## Greek Dark Ages

The Greek Dark Ages (c. 1200–800 BC) "At the beginning of the Postpalatial Bronze Age, the so-called Late Bronze Age collapse of civilisation in the Eastern Mediterranean world in c. 1200–1150 BC took place, as the great palaces and cities of the Mycenaeans were destroyed or abandoned. At around the same time, the Hittite civilization also suffered serious disruption, with cities from Troy to Gaza being destroyed. In Egypt, the New Kingdom fell into disarray, leading to the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. Following the collapse, there were fewer, smaller settlements, suggesting widespread famine and depopulation." 

The maps illustrate population distributions over the past 6ky, spanning the Greek Dark Ages period. Clear correlation where populations appear to have emerged from the same regions as the longest continuously inhabited cities.[3]

Could this have been the aftermath of an ECDO event?

## Gap in Chinese history

"If counting from the following Shang dynasty which has been universally recognized by historians, China has only about 3,700 years of recorded history, which is still a big gap from 5,000 years."

## Haplogroup data

"It makes sense that lineages that have likely originated in the same or nearby region at around the same time may have experienced similar catastrophes or events / interactions that impact male line demographics and drive migrations to particular regions at particular times."
