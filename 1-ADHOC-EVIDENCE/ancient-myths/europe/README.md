# Europe Ancient Flood Myths

## Crete (Greece)

Historical account of the Crete catastrophes (1750 BC), explicit mention made of the direction from which water came during the first event: "great tidal waves moved towards the island from the north and swept over it", as would be predicted of the Aegean Sea during a State 1 to State 2 rotation. It is also described that the second catastrophe, 50 years later, was dominated by volcanism and earthquakes.

## Kataklysmos and Ekpyrosis

Censorinus makes mention of this water/fire sequence as being coincident to a planetary cycle in De Die Natali (238 AD): "There is a period called 'the supreme year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, moon and all the planets return to their original position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks 'kataklysmos', which means deluge, and a great summer, called by the Greeks 'ekpyrosis' or combustion of the world. The world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs".

## Atlantis (~9600 BC)

"But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island."

AFAIK, Atlantis is North America.
