# Europe Ancient Flood Myths

## Crete (Greece), 1750 BC

The Minoan civilization, which existed on Crete and other islands in the Mediterranean, seems to have ended without clear traces of invasion or other remnants. It is suspected that natural disasters, more extreme than a simple earthquake, were the cause of the downfall of Minoan civilization.

Velikovsky, in his account on Crete in Earth in Upheaval, references two sources:
- Sir Arthur Evans (see `LITERATURE-MEDIA/sir-arthur-evans`) who excavated the Minoan palace of Knossos on Crete references two catastrophes.
- Marinatos' wrote a work on two catastrophes that destroyed Minoan civilization; which included a large volcanic eruption and subsequent deluge, evidenced by houses that were unearthed on the north of Crete. (hard copy in this folder)

The Minoan Eruption of Santorini Volcano is estimated to have been around 1600 BC. This has been linked to a tsunami which hit the region around the same time: *"A Minoan and a Neolithic tsunami recorded in coastal sediments of Ios Island, Aegean Sea, Greece"*:

## Deucalion Greek Flood Myth (1528 BC)

*"For some time during the Middle Ages, many European Christian scholars continued to accept Greek mythical history at face value, thus asserting that Deucalion's flood was a regional flood, that occurred a few centuries later than the global one survived by Noah's family. On the basis of the archaeological stele known as the Parian Chronicle, Deucalion's Flood was usually fixed as occurring some time around 1528 BC. Deucalion's flood may be dated in the chronology of Saint Jerome to c. 1460 BC."*

## Atlantis (~9600 BC)

"But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island."

## Kataklysmos and Ekpyrosis

Censorinus makes mention of this water/fire sequence as being coincident to a planetary cycle in De Die Natali (238 AD): "There is a period called 'the supreme year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, moon and all the planets return to their original position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks 'kataklysmos', which means deluge, and a great summer, called by the Greeks 'ekpyrosis' or combustion of the world. The world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs".
