Asia has a well-stocked library of flood stories [1], including from Tibet [2] and China [3]. Siberian mammoths [4] and megaflood evidence from the Altai region [5] (attributed to ice-age glacial lake failures according to strictly uniformitarian dogma), and Mohenjo-Daro [6] offer an excellent fit with the ECDO predicted moment of inertia.[7]

"According to the Tibetan traditions, the highlands of tibet, too, were flooded in a great cataclysm. The traditions of the Tibetans speak also of terrifying comets that caused great upheavals." [2]

"In the days of Yahou the event occurred which separates the almost obliterated and very dim past of China from the period that is considered historical: China was overwhelmed by an immense catastrophe. 'At that time the miracle is said to have happened that the sun during a span of ten days did not set, the forests were ignited, and a multitude of abominable vermin was brought forth. [..] In the lifetime of Yao [Yahou] the sun did not set for ten full days and the entire land was flooded.' An immense way 'that reached the sky'fell down on the land of China. 'The water was well up on the high mountains and the foothills could not be seen at all.'"[2]

Many more such accounts from this region can be found at reference [1].
