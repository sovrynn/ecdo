During the Manu deluge the flood was probably super high. Only 1 mountain peak in Himalaya was visible called Navabandhana. Current highest peaks are around 8000m. I do suspect there might be changes in between of heights of Himalaya as this happened at the end of golden age.

In the Manu story they mention that the only highest peak of Himalayas was dry called Navabandhan. So, it seems Himalayas were present in previous deluge as well.

There is a research paper by BB Lal (presented at ICHR) which dates this flood to 2000 - 1900 BC using carbon dating. Paper in `hard-copies`:

*"It relates to the history the Sarasvatī, which is a river par excellence in the Ṛigveda. She has been eulogized as the best of mothers (ambitame), the best of rivers (nadītame) and the best of goddesses (devitame) [RV 2.41.16]. She originated in the mountains and went all the way down to the sea (yatī giribhya ā samudrāt) [RV 7.95.2]. She was so powerful that she shattered the mountain peaks with her fast and powerful waves (iyam śuṣmebhir bisakhā ivārujat sānu girīṇām taviṣebhirūrmibhiḥ) [RV 6.61.2]."*

## Sinking of Dwarka – 5525 BCE

Sinking of the city of Dwarka might have been due to great flood. 5525 BCE is pretty close to the Noahic event 5401 BCE. 

[Analysis by Nilesh Oak](https://nileshoak.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/flooding-destruction-of-dwarka-5525-bce)

Dwarka of Krishna, on the west coast of India, was destroyed by flood 36 years after the Mahabharata War. 
I defined time interval of 6500 years for the plausible year of Mahabharata War based on AV (Arundhati-Vasistha) observation of Mahabharata text. 
Further I could validate 18 day timeline and year of 5561 BCE, proposed by Dr. P V Vartak. 
I validated 5561 BCE as the year of Mahabharata War based on consistent interpretation of 200+ astronomy observations of Mahabharata text.

This would lead us to the timing of flooding of Dwarka as follows:
5561 BCE + 36 years = 5525 BCE

Thus flooding and Destruction of Krishna’s Dwarka occurred in 5525 BCE.

## Sinking of Kandam Kumari

I just noticed that the Tamil flood story is describing two consecutive events. The sinking of the (now submerged) southern land [S1>S2], and then when they’ve just set up shop again the same thing happens again, submerging land further north [S2>S1]. Very much like the Crete account. Be nice to find a possible date on the Tamil account.

## Kritayuga - Oldest Flood Deluge in Indian mythology

One deluge that started the golden age - Kritayuga.
