## Great Flood (2300 BCE?)

"The Great Flood of Gun-Yu, also known as the Gun-Yu myth, was a major flood in ancient China that allegedly continued for at least two generations, which resulted in great population displacements among other disasters, such as storms and famine. People left their homes to live on the high hills and mountains, or nest on the trees. According to mythological and historical sources, it is traditionally dated to the third millennium BCE, or about 2300â€“2200 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Yao."

Not so much a myth as an account, it lines up with Korea's founding myth, that of Dangun.

Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision (`LITERATURE/velikovsky`), Chapter 4 page 100, has a compilation of the accounts of this flood during Emperor Yao's reign.

On the date discrepancy between this event and 1700 BC (`ADHOC-EVIDENCE/frequency`), Velikovsky has this to say: "Calculations were undertaken to establish the dates of the Em-peror Yahou. On the basis of a remark that the constellation Niao, thought to be the constellation Hydra, culminated at sunset on the day of the vernal equinox in the time of Yahou, it was reckoned that the flood occurred in the twenty-third century before the present era, but this date has been questioned by many."

### Xia Dynasty dates

The Xia Dynasty is dated to be established in 2070 BC and disestablished 1600 BC. Given that the flood occured within a lifetime before the establishment (2070 BC), there's already a clear discrepancy between the flood's date hypothesized date of 2300 BC and the Xia Dynasty.
