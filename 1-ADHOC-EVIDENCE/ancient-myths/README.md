# Mythical ECDO evidence

This folder is for documenting all myths that reference a potential ECDO event, most commonly through flood myths. There are quite a lot.

Specifically, myths that can be approximately dated, reference specific flood areas, or contain detailed flood accounts are the most useful.

See `ADHOC-EVIDENCE/bible` for Bible flood myths.
