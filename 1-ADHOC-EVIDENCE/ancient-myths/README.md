# Mythical ECDO evidence

This folder is for documenting all myths that reference a potential ECDO event, most commonly by mentioning flooding. There are quite a few.

## TODO leads to look into

- Gold mine (put a hard copy in here): https://talkorigins.org/faqs/flood-myths.html
- The Bible, Egyptian legends and other stories from antiquity describe a solar event, often involving a black sun.
- Altai megafloods
- Atlantis sinking, Plato, around 9600 BC
