# Frequency of ECDO event

Goal: Predict how frequent the ECDO event is.

## Current Hypothesis - 3700 years

The current hypothesis is that the ECDO may occur approximately every 3700 years.

First of all, 1700 BC (~3700 years ago) appears to be a very historically significant time:
- Many records of a "natural disaster" event - from Crete, Turkey, Pakistan (Mohenjo-Daro), Tiahuanaco, Easter Island (`ancient-myths`)
- Records of immigration in the Mediterranean area coinciding with the Greek Dark Ages (`human-history-remains`)
- Mammoths mutating 3700 years ago (`animal-plant-evidence/animal-remains`)
- Canaanite palace swallowed by a fissure 3700 years ago (`human-history-remains`)
- Tall el-Hammam city melted by extreme temperature ~3700 years ago (`human-history-remains/human-built-structures`)

If we go back 3700 more years to 5400 BC, there is evidence as well:
- Noahic deluge in 5200 BC (`bible`)
- Chichancanab lake filled with saltwater about 7800 years ago (`animal-plant-evidence/animal-remains`)

Going back another 3700 years to 9100 BC:
- Plato's account of a story about Atlantis sinking in approximately 9600 BC (`ancient-myths`)
- End of the Younger Dryas

Finally you also have a harmonic of the gas giant grand cycle which aligns with these dates (`solar-system`).

## Grep searching notable dates

To see what info is in the repo on notable dates, run a grep search: `grep -nr 3700 --include="*.md" .`

Sometimes the dates are just slightly off (ex: 3650). You'd have to be more thorough with grep to find those.

## TODO

There's some data from Earth core/soil data showing evidence of past geomagnetic excursions. That would be good to investigate and put in here.

Bond cycle, which indicates massive ice-melt events every 1000-1500 years, many of them coincident with known megaflood accounts.
