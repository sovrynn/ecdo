# Animal and Plant Evidence

This folder is for evidence of ECDO events related to living things, except humans.

## Contents

- `animal-remains`: Animal remains from previous ECDO events that give us certain clues.
- `biodiversity-hotspots`: What biodiversity hotspots can tell us about the ECDO.
- (Speculative) `penguins`: How did penguins survive ECDO events?
- (Speculative) `sunflowers`: Are sunflowers affected by ECDO events?

Don't put human evidence in here, put that in `human-history-remains`.
