# Physical Material Evidence of ECDO events

This folder is for potential physical material evidence of past or impending ECDO events, such as large rocks in strange locations.

## Contents

- `ice`: What can ice tell us about the ECDO?
- `land-soil-earth`: Data from clay that potentially relates to ECDO events.
- `large-rocks`: Large rocks - how did they end up there?

Human-related physical objects, such as tools, belong in `human-history-remains`.

## Great Circle Artifacts

![great circle artifacts](img/great-circle-artifacts.jpg "great circle artifacts")

Angkor Wat and Nazca lie on the great circle centred at Stonehenge (red trace). Another great circle connects Easter Island, Machu Picchu, Giza and Mohenjo-daro (blue trace). Intersections at Peru and Cambodia may account for the high density of megaliths, geoglyphs and curious artefacts found there. The planes defined by these great circles intersect along an axis approximately connecting Angkor Wat to Nazca/Paracas, inclined to one another at sin âˆ’1 (0.9) the gradian/degree ratio being 9/10.
