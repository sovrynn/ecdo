# Adhoc ECDO evidence

This directory contains evidence of the ECDO which is not necessarily scientific in nature. Often, it consists of traces of past ECDO events in meatspace, geological data, or human memory. But it can also refer to human behavior or other phenomena concerning the potential impending ECDO event.

## Contents

Old evidence from humans:
- `ancient-myths`: Myths that may reference past ECDO events.
- `bible`: Investigation of potentially relevant accounts from the Bible.
- `human-history-remains`: Learning from human history and remains.

Old evidence from the world around us:
- `animal-plant-evidence`: Biological evidence (excluding humans) of past ECDO events, such as frozen animal remains.
- `physical-material-evidence`: Physical evidence of past ECDO events, such as big rocks high up in the mountains.
- `solar-system`: Evidence from the solar system.
- `earth-geo-state`: Evidence from the geological state of the Earth, such as weather.

Modern, recent evidence for impending ECDO:
- `elite-preparation`: The elites seem to be preparing for... something.
- `government-intervention`: Investigating potential government intervention related to the ECDO, such as attempting to stop/delay the ECDO or censoring information about it.
- `research`: Research related to the ECDO.

Other:
- `frequency`: Figuring out dates which seem to have historical significance.
- `date-anomalies`: Investigating date anomalies which may be relevant to dating ECDO-related events.
