# Prompt

Transla
- Don't translate exhibit markers (ex: 7D)
- Don't translate numbers in numerical form. Translate counting words (ex: first)
- Don't translate acronyms
- Find the citations and put them in []. Citations are numbers ranging from 1 to 100, in weird spaces. In particular, the hard ones to find will be the ones attached to other numbers. These are often attached to dates. When you clearly have a date, but it is attached to a citation, (ex: Aug 201642), then you should format it as "Aug 2016 [42]".
