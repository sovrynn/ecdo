For fonts, modeling after some of the research papers I've seen...

The headers should be non-serif. Blocky. Sharp edges. This looks clean. Don't go for rounded or serif these look bad in large sizes.

For main text... non-serif version isn't bad either. Maruburi. Try it.

The italics... I probably need to find an italic font. Non-serif. Slanted. This is best. Or perhaps an extra thin serif version?

## Verdict

Non-serif fonts look clean in the minimalistic PDF style you're creating.

Gothic, noto sans kr. maruburi extra thin looks nice

gothic for big
noto sans for average
thin serif for italic

## Actual verdict

Gothic A1 bold for bold
Nanum myeongjo (serif) for main
Gothic A1 thin for italic
