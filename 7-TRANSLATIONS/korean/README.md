# Korean

For fonts, modeling after some of the research papers I've seen...

The headers should be non-serif. Blocky. Sharp edges. This looks clean. Don't go for rounded or serif these look bad in large sizes.

Might be worth finding an italic korean font.

## Actual verdict

- Gothic A1 bold for bold
- Nanum myeongjo (serif) for main
- Gothic A1 thin for italic
