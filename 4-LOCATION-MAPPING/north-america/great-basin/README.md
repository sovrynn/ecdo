# The Great Basin

The Great Basin is a large area of watersheds in the western United States. Definitely a very interesting area to look into for evidence of past ECDO events.

Given the existence of large salt deposits in Death Valley, and the Great Salt Lake in Utah, it is likely that this area floods in some manner during the ECDO event.
