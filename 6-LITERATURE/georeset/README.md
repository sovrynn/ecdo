Rumble author (geologist) who has published a [video](https://rumble.com/v5auer1-wave-concept-and-creation-of-continents.html?e9s=src_v1_upp) titled "Wave concept and Creation of continents".

The basic idea is that geological features such as mountains are not created by orogenesis and tectonic plates, but by massive wave flows consisting of water, sediment, and magma - vast quantities of material that moves and relocates as one sediment body.

He estimates waves of 10-15 km or more in height from today's sea level.
