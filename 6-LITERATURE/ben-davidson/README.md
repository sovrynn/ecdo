Has produced some material potentially relevant to ECDO.

Here is his [website](suspicious0bservers.org). Seems like his info is behind a (small) paywall.

He also has a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Suspicious0bservers/search?query=6000%20year) where he talks about his theories.

He believes there is a 6000 year "event" cycle.
