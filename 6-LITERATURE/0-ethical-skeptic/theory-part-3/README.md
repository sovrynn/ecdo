# Theory Part 3: Exothermic Core-Mantle Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) 

## Summary

Of course, the killer thesis. It makes a jump in logic, which may or may not be true until it can be verified. But the flooding of the Khafre pyramid, creates a necessity, for some kind of mechanism, which could have brought this about in the past, may again, and may be linked to the reality of core heating.

The assumptions/priors are:
1. Weakening of Earth's magnetic moment
2. Heating of the Earth's mantle from the core
3. Resulting in heating of the ocean and carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere

Leading to the big hypothesis - once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the mantle gyroscopically rotates, through a phenomenon like the Dzhanibekov rotation.

The center of the LLVM structure structures is perpendicular to the centers of the ocean heating. This is seen as not coincidental.

The point that rotates to the North Pole is the lighter LLVM, which is in South Africa's cusp. The angle between the axis of this point through the center of the Earth is 104 degrees from the North Pole. The South Pole would then become a point in the Pacific.

The points on the Earth which stay fixed wrt the relative rotation of the Earth around its axis, are the points perpendicular to the two LLVM lightweight centroids, which are the centers of the heating of the Earth's surface from the mantle. These are in north South America and Indonesia.

Finally, to tie it all together, the author points to the Pyramid of Khafre and the angle of its two shafts. This pyramid lies on the same longitude line as the lighter LLVM centroid in South Africa. The angle between the two shafts is 104 degrees, which means it may have been intentionally constructed as a measurement tool for this Dzhanibekov rotation of the Earth. The shafts, in turn, point towards the North Pole in the state of Earth before and after the pole flip.
