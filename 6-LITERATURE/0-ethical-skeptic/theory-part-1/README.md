# Part 1: Earth Warming Coming From the Core

## Summary

The thesis begins with ten observations that "prove wrong" the man-made global warming hypothesis, creating a need for "plurality" - a better explanation.

The observations are as follows, from weakest to strongest:
1. Inconsistencies in CO2 emission data which are unexplainable by man-made factors alone
    - winter month carbon ppm slowdown
    - yearly vernal jump
    - Anecdote: Covid (record C02 increase when industry is shut down)
    - Anecdote: 2018 - 2020
2. Atmospheric CO2 levels follow temperature rises and are accelerating - Man's carbon-productiving activity is linear and of insufficient slope to drive this
3. CO2's mechanism of heating the atmosphere by capturing more solar energy doesn't hold up with conservation of solar radiation wrt the atmosphere
4. Mean sea level is rising, but sea variange range is also increasing, seemingly caused by global ocean current speed increase, which is not plausibly caused by changes in the atmosphere wind speed
5. (VERY IMPORTANT) Earth's magnetic field ranged high, indicating a weakening in the Earth's magnetic moment generated from its core. This matches in time with the recent global temperature increases
6. Earth's rotational measures' alignment with global temperatures diverged in 1930, sea temperature increases coincide with speeding up of the outer rotational body.
7. There was a heat plume in 2023 which could not be explained by the atmosphere or man.
8. Earthquake and volcano activity have been increasing as well along with temperature and CO2
9. Heat anomalies have a physical pattern on the Earth's continents
10. Deep ocean levels are absorbing lots of heat. Tremendous amounts of heat.

So, conclusion? The Earth's core undergoes state change, releasing heat, which warm the deep oceans through deepwater sea vents, which warm the entire oceans, which warms the atmosphere.
