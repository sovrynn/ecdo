# Sir Arthur Evans

Excavated and rebuilt the Palace of Minos at Knossos.

Velikovsky references him in Earth in Upheaval, page 171: *"The monumental work of Sir Arthur Evans, The Palace of Minos at Knossos, furnishes abundant evidence of the physical nature of the destruc- tive agent that brought to a close the ages of Minoan culture, one after the other. He speaks of a great catas- trophe" that took place toward the close of Middle Minoan II."*

*In the later phase of Middle Minoan III the phenomena "conclusively point to a seismic cause for the great over-throw that befell the Palace and surrounding Town." 5 "Throughout the exposed areas of the building [palace] there is evidence of a great overthrow, burying with it a long succession of deposits."* - Velikovsky Page 172

*At the end of the next age, Late Minoan I, the existence of the palace of Knossos "was cut short by some extrane-ous cause, though without any such signs of wholesale ruin as seem to have marked its earlier disaster."* - Velikovsky Page 172

	- Page 258: "The correspondence presented by the ceramic remains of a series of stratified deposits with those which at Knossos have been best preserved in the Loom-Weight Basements is one of the many evidences of a parallel catastrophe that befell both Palaces at the close of the present Period."

	- Page 299: "As already observed there seems to be good warrant for placing the approximate limits of MM II between 1900 and 1700 BC. It is clear that this stage of Minoan culture was cut short by a catastrophe, which from its widespread character may be thought to connect itself with a greater current of history, lying outside the insular limits".
