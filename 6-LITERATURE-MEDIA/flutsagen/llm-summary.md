# Intro LLM Summary: flood legends, ethnographic perspective, biblical narratives, cultural origins, divine retribution, natural causes, global distribution

The book "The Flood Legends" by Richard Andree, published in 1891, explores flood legends from an ethnographic and folklore perspective. It critiques theologians for incorporating these legends into biblical narratives without considering their unique origins and contexts. Andree notes the prevalence of flood legends across continents, highlighting both similarities and distinctive features. The book delves into flood legends from cultures like those in the Near East, Asia, Africa, Australia, the South Seas, and the Americas, discussing natural causes such as earthquakes and whirlwinds.

The text starts with the Chaldean flood report, contrasting it with the biblical version and emphasizing its potential as the oldest known flood narrative. It discusses how earlier theories suggested that the Genesis flood narrative was inspired by Babylonian literature, which is now confirmed to predate the biblical narrative. The Chaldean flood report, discovered by G. Smith in 1872, is crucial, presenting a polytheistic perspective where the flood is a natural disaster rather than divine retribution.

Andree examines the similarities and differences between the Babylonian and biblical narratives, suggesting that the Hebrews either carried the flood legend from Chaldea or learned it during their Babylonian exile. The Bible's narrative, influenced by the Babylonian version, emphasizes divine judgment over sin. Modern interpretations propose that the biblical flood might have been localized to the known world of the Hebrews.

Flood legends in other regions, such as Persia, India, Transylvania, and various parts of Asia, are also explored. These legends often involve divine intervention and the survival of a select few. Scholars debate whether similarities indicate borrowing or independent development, with some arguing for unique cultural origins.

Various flood myths and legends from different cultures are highlighted, showcasing similarities and differences with the biblical narrative. In the Andamanese mythology, a creator god sends a flood that leaves only four survivors. The Karens in Burma have a story of two brothers surviving a flood on a raft. Cambodians and the Binna$ people also have flood stories, intertwining divine intervention and survival. Polynesians and Malaysians recount floods possibly influenced by tsunamis. The Itelmens from Kamchatka describe a flood following the disappearance of their creator, with survivors escaping on rafts. In contrast, Chinese and Japanese flood stories are rooted in historical events, such as the flooding of the Yellow River. The Shujing describes a flood managed by Yu with practical solutions. Greek mythology includes flood narratives, notably Deucalion’s, influenced by Near Eastern traditions. African flood tales are less common due to regular flooding, but some exist, especially in Western Australia and Victoria, with stories of separation and rescue. Pacific Island cultures, including Fiji, Belau, and Society Islands, have flood myths involving divine retribution and survival. These stories reflect cultural interpretations of catastrophic flooding, emphasizing survival, divine intervention, and the rebirth of humanity.

You explore flood legends across various cultures, starting with the Leeward Islands where a fisherman's act angers Ruahatu, the South Sea god, leading to a flood and the relocation of the fisherman's family to Toa-marama. In Samoa, it's believed that fish turned to stone as waters receded, creating the land. The Sandwich Islanders mention a flood named Kai-a-Kahinelii. Lawson, an English sailor, heard songs about a great flood on the Marquesas Islands. On Fijian and Palau Islands, as well as the Society Islands, flood myths often involve divine retribution and a sole survivor repopulating the land. Biblical influences are noted but not prominent in South Sea legends, mostly recorded by missionaries. Among the Eskimos, flood tales often stem from natural events, featuring survivors escaping to mountains or kayaks. North American Indian flood tales, collected later, may have Christian influences due to missionary interactions. Jacob's work from 1884 discusses Algonquin flood narratives blending indigenous and biblical elements, featuring Manabozho and a turtle. Among other tribes, flood stories highlight common themes of divine retribution and survival, often featuring unique cultural elements. You also uncover specific tales from the Montagnais, Hare Indians, Loucheux, Cherokee, Mandan, Knistino, Clallams, Lummi, and Makah, each with distinct details but sharing common themes of survival and divine intervention.

You hear stories of floods from various Native American tribes, each with unique twists. Near Lake Tahoe, Washo recount a flood caused by an earthquake, sinking a temple built by slaves. Tolowa speak of a long rain causing a flood, leaving only a few survivors. Among the Maidu, a flood turned a valley into a sea, leading to the repopulation by two survivors blessed by a "great man." In recent California tribes, the coyote often plays a key role, either as a creator or helper in flood stories. Further north, among the Xlinkites and Bella-Coola Indians, the raven is central, escaping floods and bringing back order. In Mexico, flood stories feature survivors who repopulate the world, similar to the biblical Noah. In Guatemala, the Quiché have the Popol Vuh, detailing the creation and destruction of humans. Peruvians have legends of shepherds and brothers surviving on floating mountains. In Haiti, a flood was caused by a cacique, and in British Guiana, a flood resulted from a magical tree being felled. These stories, rich with mythological elements, reflect diverse cultural interpretations of natural events.

You explore flood legends found globally but missing in regions like Arabia, Central Asia, North Asia, China, Japan, and Africa. These legends vary widely, hinting at multiple origins rather than a single source. Jacob Grimm noted that these stories often mirror local conditions and experiences, differing from the biblical account. You discuss how flood legends persist in many cultures, focusing on the idea of divine punishment and the survival of a ship or boat, while noting specific details like the dove with an olive branch are more distinctive. You highlight the recurrence of certain features, such as using a rope to tether the rescue vessel, and the absence of these legends among Arab peoples and unique Iranian mythology, suggesting diverse origins. You also mention the Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription that describes a destruction similar to the biblical flood but lacks explicit mention of a water flood. You distinguish between original and borrowed flood legends, noting the influence of the Middle Eastern flood story, especially in America. You touch on natural causes of floods, emphasizing earthquake-induced tsunamis and their impact on coastal areas. You discuss how fossils of marine life on high mountains inspired flood legends among various cultures, referencing classical observations by Herodotus and others. Lastly, you examine how local catastrophes like cyclones and tsunamis contribute to flood myths, concluding that these widespread occurrences suggest flood legends are based on multiple local experiences.

# flutsagen-txt/input.txt: flood legends, ethnography, folklore

The text describes a book titled "The Flood Legends" authored by Richard Andree, published in 1891. The work aims to explore flood legends from an ethnographic and folklore perspective, emphasizing the importance of these legends beyond religious interpretations. Andree critiques the tendency of theologians to incorporate flood legends into biblical narratives without sufficient consideration of their unique origins and contexts. He highlights the prevalence of flood legends across different continents, noting that while some may have been influenced by the biblical account, others exhibit distinct, independent characteristics. The book includes a detailed examination of flood legends from various cultures, including those from the Near East, Asia, Africa, Australia, the South Seas, and the Americas. Andree discusses the natural causes behind these legends, such as earthquakes, sea breaches, and whirlwinds. The text begins with an introduction to the Chaldean flood report, contrasting it with the biblical version and highlighting its significance as potentially the oldest known flood narrative.

# flood reports, biblical narrative, Babylonian epic

Earlier assumptions suggested that the flood narrative in Genesis was borrowed from a similar report found in Babylonian literature. However, recent findings confirm that the Babylonian flood report predates the biblical narrative and served as its source. The Chaldean flood report, discovered by Assyriologist G. Smith in 1872, is a key piece of evidence supporting this view. Unlike the biblical narrative, which presents the flood as a punishment for sin, the Babylonian version does not solely attribute the flood to divine retribution.

The tablets containing the Chaldean flood report date back to the 7th century BCE, but their content is believed to originate from an earlier period, around 2000 BCE. These tablets are part of a larger epic that narrates the adventures of a sun hero, Gilgamesh or Jšdubar, and include a detailed account of the flood. According to this epic, the flood was announced to a man named Shamash-napish-tim (Xisuthros) by the god Ea, instructing him to build a ship and take aboard his family, animals, and seeds of all kinds. The flood lasted for six days and seven nights, and after the waters receded, Xisuthros released birds to determine if the ground was dry enough for landing. He eventually landed on Mount Nizir and made a sacrifice to the gods, who then elevated him among them.

Key differences between the Babylonian and biblical narratives include the polytheistic versus monotheistic perspectives, the depiction of the ark as a ship rather than a chest, and the presence of maritime details in the Babylonian version. Additionally, the Babylonian report portrays the flood as a natural disaster rather than a divine punishment for human sin.

These findings suggest that the Hebrews either carried the flood legend with them during their migration from Ur in Chaldea or learned it during their exile in Babylon. The similarities between the two accounts indicate a common origin, with the Babylonian narrative being the likely precursor to the biblical version.

# flood legends, biblical narrative, Indo-Germanic myth

Following the Chaldean flood report, the Bible's narrative is considered the second oldest and has significantly influenced traditions across different cultures due to its widespread dissemination and compelling content. Within the Bible, specifically Genesis, two distinct sources, referred to as the Elohist and Jehovist traditions, can be identified, which share similar themes but differ in certain details. These traditions emphasize divine judgment over sinful humanity, a concept that stands out prominently compared to other flood legends. While the exact factual basis of the biblical narrative in relation to the Chaldean flood remains uncertain, its religious significance is highlighted.

The biblical narrative suggests that the flood covered the entire Earth, but modern interpretations propose that the flooding might have been limited to the known world of the Hebrews, encompassing areas around the Black Sea, Persia, Arabia, and the eastern Mediterranean. Eduard Süß provided a scientific explanation for the flood, attributing it to a significant earthquake near the Persian Gulf, possibly accompanied by a cyclone. This interpretation is supported by cuneiform documents, indicating that the flood affected the Mesopotamian lowlands without extending globally.

Moving geographically, flood legends in other regions are examined, starting with Persia. In Persia, despite the arid climate, a flood legend exists in the Bundehesh, a younger part of Persian sacred literature. This legend describes a series of rains sent by the star Tistar, resulting in a flood that killed harmful creatures. Unlike the biblical flood, this legend focuses more on the storm and the battle between Tistar and the demon Apaosha, with the flood being a secondary element. These reports are also found in the Avesta and are believed to be an ancient Indo-Germanic myth, independent of the biblical narrative.

In Indian Vedic literature, flood narratives appear in prose writings of the Brahmanic period and are prominent in later epic poems and Puranas. Three of Vishnu's avatars, as a fish, turtle, and boar, are associated with saving humans from floods. The oldest Indian flood report, found in the Satapatha-Brahmana, narrates Vishnu’s rescue of mankind by taking the form of a fish.

# flood legends, fish story, Manu

The passage describes a flood legend from Indian mythology involving Manu and a fish, which is compared to the biblical narrative. In the morning, Manu washes his hands and receives a talking fish that predicts a flood and offers to save Manu. The fish instructs Manu to keep it until it grows too large for its current habitat, eventually placing it in the sea. The fish then foretells a flood and tells Manu to build a ship. When the flood comes, Manu ties the ship to the fish’s horn and rides it to safety on a mountain, where he waits for the waters to recede.

Following the flood, Manu repopulates the world. Another version found in the Mahabharata includes the fish, known as Brahma, guiding Manu through the flood with the seven holy Rishis, emphasizing the preservation of the Vedas and seeds of plants. A third version from the Bhagavata Purana adds that the flood was intended to save the true Vedas from a demon, with Vishnu taking the form of the fish. It also mentions that Manu took pairs of animals on the ship, possibly influenced by Semitic traditions.

Scholars debate whether the similarities between the Indian and biblical flood narratives indicate borrowing or independent development. Max Müller argues that while some similarities exist, significant differences suggest independent origins. He notes that the detail about the flood being announced seven days in advance, similar to the biblical account, is unique to the Bhagavata Purana and likely coincidental. This suggests that while there may be some shared elements, the overall narratives developed independently.

# flood myths, Indian tribes, biblical influences

In Transylvania, H. v. Wlislocki documented a flood story among the tent-dwelling Gypsies. This tale recounts a time when people lived forever without sorrow or illness, and meat, fruits, milk, and wine were abundant. An old man visited a family, leaving behind a small fish with instructions to return it unharmed after nine days. The woman, tempted by curiosity, cooked the fish, causing lightning to strike and kill her. This act triggered a deluge that submerged the entire land. Nine days later, the old man returned, instructing the man to build a boat and save himself, his new wife, relatives, and some animals and seeds to repopulate the earth after the flood, which lasted a year. Post-flood, hardship and mortality became common, and the population gradually grew again over millennia.

Wlislocki noted the similarity between this story and the biblical narratives, suggesting a mix of the Fall of Man and the Flood, with the fish replacing the apple as the catalyst. He observed that the fish in the Gypsy tale does not hold the same significance as in Indian myths, where it often grows and pulls a ship through the floodwaters.

In other regions, similar flood stories exist. For instance, Samuel Turner heard from natives at the Bhutan-Tibet border that Tibet was once submerged, and the god Gya miraculously drained the water, improving the human condition. The Lepchas in Darjeeling narrate a flood where a couple sought refuge atop Mount Tendong. In Kashmir, a flood covered the land until Kashyapa, with Vishnu’s help, drained it via mountain openings, repopulating the area afterward. The Mundari tribe in East India tells of a flood sent by Singbonga due to human misbehavior, sparing only a brother and sister who hid under a Tiriba tree. The Mundaris believe a snake named Lurbing ends the flood by becoming a rainbow, while the Uraons tell a slightly different story involving a brother and sister hiding in a crab's cave during the flood.

These tales highlight the universal theme of a great flood in various cultures, often linked to divine intervention and the survival of a select few. The inclusion of biblical elements in some stories suggests potential influence from missionary activities among these tribes.

# mythology, flood, creation

The content describes various flood myths and legends from different cultures, highlighting similarities and differences with the biblical narrative. In the mythology of the Andamanese (Mincopi), Pulugu, the creator, made the first humans, Tomo and Elewadi, who drowned and were transformed into a whale and a crab. Their grandchildren and descendants, the Tomola, ignored divine commandments, leading Pulugu to send a flood that destroyed all life except for four survivors, who later received fire from a bird named Luaratut. Among the Karens in Burma, a tradition exists where two brothers survived a flood by seeking refuge on a raft, with the younger brother getting stuck in a mango tree. In Cambodia, the Changrai mountain tribe has a flood legend akin to the biblical one. The Binna$ people believe their ancestors descended from a couple who survived a flood, and the flood story is intertwined with elements of the biblical creation story. In the Polynesian and Malay regions, flood stories are more common, possibly influenced by tsunamis. A legend from Seram mentions three people surviving a flood and receiving news from a bird about other emerging mountains. The Dayak people of Borneo recount how killing a boa constrictor led to a flood, with a woman surviving and creating fire, which eventually led to the rebirth of humanity. In the Philippines, the Bisayans narrate a story where an eagle's search for a resting place leads to the creation of islands and humans emerging from split bamboo. Overall, these stories reflect cultural interpretations of catastrophic flooding, often involving survival, divine intervention, and the reemergence of life.

# flood tales, Yellow River floods, Greek flood legends

The Itelmens, a group from Kamchatka, recount a significant flood that took place shortly after the disappearance of Kutka, their creator. This flood almost wiped out the entire population, and survivors managed to escape by building large rafts and securing them with stones to prevent drifting into the sea. After the waters receded, they stayed on their rafts atop high mountains.

In contrast, the Buddhist regions such as China and Japan do not have flood myths like the ones found in Western cultures. The flood stories in China are based on historical events, particularly the flooding of the Yellow River. The river, entering the plains as a powerful force, carries a massive amount of sediment and frequently overflows its banks, leading to widespread destruction. Notably, the river has undergone ten significant course changes throughout history, with the last two occurring in 1852 and 1887. One of these floods caused the death of around two million people.

The Shujing, an ancient Chinese text dating back to the third millennium BC, describes a great flood during the reign of Emperor Yao, which covered much of China. Unlike the biblical flood, this event is described in a straightforward manner, focusing on practical solutions rather than mythical elements. The flood was managed by Yu, who cleared forests and regulated waterways.

In Europe, Greek mythology includes two flood narratives: the tale of Ogyges and the more prominent story of Deucalion. The latter involves Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha surviving a flood sent by Zeus to cleanse humanity. After landing on Mount Parnassus, they followed divine instructions to repopulate the earth by throwing stones behind them, which transformed into humans. An annual festival in Athens commemorated this event.

These diverse flood stories highlight the cultural and geographical variations in how societies remember and interpret catastrophic natural events.

# Greek Flood Myths, Biblical Influences, Folk Tales

The narrative of the Deucalion flood, initially a simple tale of a Greek region inundated by earthquake floods, evolved over time. It incorporated elements from Near Eastern traditions, including the inclusion of animals and the use of birds to gauge conditions post-flood. For instance, Plutarch mentions Deucalion using a dove to determine if the storm had subsided. This integration became more pronounced in the second-century text "On the Syrian Goddess," where Deucalion is referred to as Sisythes and is described building an ark to survive a deluge, similar to the biblical Noah’s Ark.

Greek literature contains other flood narratives, such as the one involving Dardanus, and island-specific tales. In Phrygia, a flood story is tied to the city of Apamea, which featured coins depicting an ark, a dove with an olive branch, and the inscription NAE, suggesting Jewish and Christian influences from the second and third centuries.

Investigations show that older Greek flood tales are simpler and considered more genuine, whereas newer versions are more elaborate and detailed, reflecting influences from the Hebrew account. Eastern elements were added to the original Greek tales, likely due to the presence of Jews in Greek cities. European folk tales, recorded later in texts like the Edda, also exhibit biblical influences, despite retaining national characteristics.

For example, the Eddic flood narrative involves Odin and his brothers killing the giant Ymir, leading to a deluge that drowns most giants except for Bergelmir, who escapes in a boat. A Welsh folk tale recounts a flood in Britain where only Dmyvan and Dmyvach survive in a boat, mirroring the biblical narrative. Among the Lithuanians, a flood story exists where Pramžimas sends two giants to destroy the earth, and survivors escape in a bowl, with clear Christian influences.

A flood tale among the Voguls describes a deluge after seven years of drought, where survivors prepare boats and ropes, and the great god Numitarom creates new life forms. These stories illustrate the diverse ways in which flood narratives have evolved across cultures.

Flood tales are believed to be absent in Africa, possibly because of regular flooding patterns, such as those seen in the Nile, which do not evoke the idea of a unique, catastrophic flood. Different African rivers swell during specific times, influenced by seasonal rains and glacier melts, creating a regular pattern that does not support the concept of a singular, universal flood.

# flood tales, lake formation, Australian traditions

The text discusses various flood-related narratives and tales from different parts of Africa and Australia. In Africa, while some areas like the surroundings of Lake Moero and Lake Bangweolo experience significant flooding regularly, leading to minimal attention from residents, other regions like the Jezi River west of Gondoforo, and among the Nama and Herero, have tales related to great floods. However, these stories are not uniformly distributed across Africa; for instance, among the Sudanese Negroes and Bapedi Kaffirs, there are fewer flood tales. One notable African tale is about the formation of Lake Dilolo, attributed to a vengeful female chief.

In Australia, particularly Western Australia and Victoria, there are traditions of great floods in otherwise arid lands. These include stories where floods caused separation between communities or led to miraculous rescues. For example, in Western Australia, a tale describes a flood that submerged the land and separated black and white tribes, with the latter being swallowed by the flood. Another story from Victoria tells of a pelican rescuing a few survivors during a great flood.

Additionally, in New Guinea and the New Hebrides, there are accounts of universal floods, indicating the prevalence of such narratives in these regions. The text concludes by noting that although Penormant claimed that Melanesians, except for those with Polynesian blood in Fiji, do not have flood tales, the shared examples suggest otherwise, proving Penormant's assertion incorrect.

# Flood tales, Melanesians, Fijian Islanders

The provided text discusses several flood myths from various Pacific Island cultures, including the Fijians, Belau Islanders, and the Society Islanders. The primary focus is on the Fijian Islanders' flood tale, which narrates a significant deluge caused by the great god Nbengei in retaliation for the killing of his favored bird, Turutawa, by his great-grandsons. This flood, which lasted for days, led to the submergence of towns, hills, and mountains. The rebels, having fortified themselves on elevated positions, initially faced the rising waters unafraid. However, as the water levels increased, they sought divine assistance and were advised to construct a raft or a boat to escape the flood. After the waters receded, the survivors were regarded as superior among the Fijians, particularly those from Mbengga, who claimed descent from the eight individuals who were saved.

The text also mentions a similar flood narrative reported by Chief Beindovi from Rewa to the American expedition under Wilkes, highlighting the rescue of survivors by divine intervention using canoes. Another flood myth is discussed from the Belau Islands, where a flood occurred due to the wrath of gods seeking vengeance for the death of one of their own, Atndolf. An old woman, Milatf, survived the flood on a makeshift raft and was later resurrected by the gods, though she missed achieving immortality due to a trick played by a mischievous god, Tariit. Finally, the text touches upon a flood story from the Society Islands, where a woman was saved from a catastrophic flood and subsequently repopulated the islands with her children.

These narratives illustrate the common theme of floods in Pacific Island mythology, often involving divine retribution, survival through ingenuity, and the rebirth of humanity after a cataclysmic event.

# flood tales, polynesian myths, eskimo legends

The detailed summary of the provided content is as follows:

On the Leeward Islands, particularly Raiatea in the Society Islands, there exists a significant tradition involving Ruahatu, the Neptune of South Sea islanders. This tradition narrates an incident where a fisherman inadvertently disturbed Ruahatu by casting his fishing line into the sea where the god was resting. The fisherman's actions caused the god to emerge from the water, angered and irritated, declaring that the land was sinful and should be destroyed. However, after the fisherman pleaded for forgiveness, Ruahatu allowed him and his family to survive by relocating to the small island of Toa-marama. As the waters rose and covered the land, Toa-marama remained safe due to its location within the reefs, and the fisherman and his companions became the ancestors of the present inhabitants.

In Samoa, it is widely believed that much of the current land was once underwater, with fish turning into stones as the waters receded.

Among the Sandwich Islanders, a flood named Kai-a-Kahinelii is mentioned in their cosmogonic legends.

An English sailor, Lawson, reported hearing traditional songs about a great flood while living on the Marquesas Islands for 24 years.

On both the Fijian and Palau Islands, as well as the Society Islands, flood myths often involve human offenses against gods or heroes leading to divine retribution. These stories typically feature a single survivor who repopulates the land.

Biblical influences are noted but are not prominent in South Sea legends, which were mostly recorded by missionaries.

Among the Eskimos, flood tales appear to originate from natural events rather than biblical influences. For instance, Hall mentions such traditions among Eskimos near the North American coast, and Petitot recounts similar tales from the Tchiglit Eskimos. One story describes a great flood covering the Earth, with people surviving by tying their boats together. Another tells of an Eskimo named the son of the owl who stopped the flood by throwing his bow and earrings into the water.

Franz Boas reported a flood legend from central Eskimos describing how rising sea levels led to widespread flooding and the formation of mountain peaks from stranded ice. Many marine creatures were left on higher ground.

Eskimos on the Prince of Wales Peninsula have a legend about an ancient flood accompanied by an earthquake, with survivors escaping to the tops of mountains in their kayaks.

North American Indian flood tales were mostly collected later and may have been influenced by Christian reports due to missionary interactions.

These flood tales across different cultures highlight common themes of divine retribution, natural disasters, and survival, often featuring unique cultural elements and local adaptations.

# flood tales, Algonquins, creation stories

Jacob's work from 1884 discusses flood narratives among the Algonquins, noting a blend of indigenous traditions and biblical elements, likely influenced by Christian missionaries. The Algonquins had oral and pictographic records of creation, the flood, and early migrations. These traditions were recorded in "Walum Olum," or "Painted Sticks," a set of mnemonic symbols with explanations in both the original language and English, found by Rafinesque in 1822. While the creation narrative clearly reflects biblical influence, the flood tale appears more original, attributing the flood to a higher spirit symbolized by a snake. This tale involves Manabozho, a powerful figure, and features a turtle island where survivors gather. Among the Algonquin tribes, the turtle plays significant roles in mythology, often linked to the creation of the earth. Kohl also documented similar flood stories among the Ojibwas, featuring Manabozho and the turtle, with variations including a tragic incident involving a wolf and a snake. These stories highlight the integration of indigenous beliefs with external influences, providing insights into the cultural and religious evolution of North American tribes.

# Flood story, Manaboschu, Animals

The remaining snakes slipped sadly into a lake, causing a loud noise and scattering their medicine bags' contents along the shore and nearby forests. The water began swirling and swelling into murky whirlpools, and heavy clouds covered the sky, leading to torrential rains. The entire area, eventually the whole world, was flooded. Manaboschu, terrified, leaped from one mountain to another, but the rising waters pursued him. He finally found a high mountain but even that was soon flooded. The water rose up to the fir tree's top, where Manaboschu was perched, reaching up to his waist, shoulders, and finally his mouth. It halted, possibly because the snakes exhausted their magical remedies or deemed it sufficient. Manaboschu endured for five days and nights on the tree, thinking hard about his next move.

On the sixth day, he spotted a loon swimming on the water and asked it to dive and find the earth. The loon dove multiple times but couldn't reach the bottom and reported back that the earth was submerged. Desperate, Manaboschu saw a muskrat's frozen body floating towards him. Reviving the muskrat with his breath, he requested it to dive and retrieve some earth. The muskrat dived and returned dead but held a few grains of sand in its paw. Manaboschu dried and scattered these grains over the water, and they grew into islands, which he joined to form larger land masses.

This flood story is distinctly Indian, with the sending out of animals potentially influenced by Christianity but likely original. In a similar flood story, underground gods battled Wesukta, the main god, and sought the thunder god's aid to send a flood. Wesukta survived in a large canoe and sent a fish to retrieve earth, from which he created new land. Among the Tinne Indians, flood stories are common, though they vary and were studied by Abbé Petitot who attempted to prove the Asian origin of the Indians, comparing them to various ancient cultures. His analogies highlight the 'folk idea' but don't establish a direct link between the Tinne Indians and ancient peoples.

# flood myths, indigenous tales, animal scouts

The flood tales from various indigenous North American tribes present unique narratives with common themes. For the Montagnais or Chipewayans, a great snow flood occurred in September, melting due to the release of heat from a leather sack gnawed by a mouse. An old man, foreseeing the flood, survived by building a canoe and gathering animals. He sent animals like the beaver, muskrat, and duck to find land, with the duck returning successfully. The old man then created an island from mud brought by the duck. Other versions include a crow and turtle dove, with the latter bringing a pine sprout. Similar stories are narrated by the Dogrib and Slave Indians.

Among the Hare Indians, the survivor is named Kunyon, meaning "Wise," who builds a raft after foreseeing the flood. A crow instigates the flood and is punished by Kunyon, later escaping to earth and causing trouble. A small white owl helps Kunyon discover the crow’s mischief, leading to the repopulation of the earth.

The Loucheux or Dindjió, the northernmost Tinne Indians, share a similar story where the flood waters recede into a chasm, and the earth is repopulated by transformed animals. The canoe lands on Tschaneguta, meaning "Old Man's Place."

Cherokee tradition includes a unique element where a dog predicts the flood and instructs his master to build a boat, ensuring survival by throwing the dog into the water. This story lacks biblical echoes aside from the prediction and construction of a vessel.

For the Mandan people, the flood is caused by the first man's greed, leading to the construction of a wooden tower or ark. Part of the nation is saved, and a model of this structure is erected in each village to remember the event. The Okippe festival commemorates the ark, featuring a "great canoe" in the village square and a turtle dove symbolizing the flood narrative. While these elements resemble biblical accounts, some scholars suspect Christian influences, particularly in the ark and dove symbolism.

These flood stories highlight diverse cultural interpretations and shared elements across different indigenous communities, showcasing both unique and common features in their narratives.

# flood legends, indigenous tribes, North America

The text describes several Native American flood legends, each with unique details:

The Knistino (Trees) recount a legend where, during a great flood centuries ago, all Indian tribes gathered on the Côteau des Prairies in Minnesota to escape rising waters. They constructed rafts using cedar branches. As the water covered the tree tops, some ravens managed to swim to the west, and their descendants settled there, speaking similarly to the Twanas. The mountain where the ravens were tied is called the 'Holder.'

The Clallams, neighboring the Twanas, have a tradition of a flood that supposedly occurred within the last three to four generations. An elder reported seeing a survivor of the flood. Their 'Mount Ararat' differs from that of the Twanas.

Lummi Indians near Washington's northern border also have a flood story. According to the Puhallop near Tacoma, a high mountain called "the old land" near Steilacoom was the only land not submerged. An old man survived on a raft and used a crow to check for dry land, eventually finding it when the bird returned with a leaf. This legend may have Christian origins, influenced by missionaries.

Makah Indians at Cape Flattery narrate a flood caused by an earthquake, which turned Cape Flattery into an island and dried up Neah Bay. The flood lasted for four days before receding. Survivors either swam north or were carried by the current, leading to the settlement of Makahs in Clallam or Kwenaitchehat. Swan attributes the cause to volcanic activity and sees it as a precise narration of a natural event.

Washo near Lake Tahoe tell of a flood caused by a wave from the sea, triggered by the Great Spirit. Slaves built a temple for their masters to seek refuge during floods. During an earthquake, the temple sank into Lake Tahoe, leaving only the dome above water. The survivors were thrown into a cave by the Great Spirit, where they continue to howl.

Tolowa in California narrate a long-lasting rain causing a flood that inundated valleys. Most Indians drowned, but a couple survived on a mountain, living on fish until the waters receded. All current Indians descend from these survivors.

Among the Maidu northeast of Sacramento, a legend speaks of a peaceful life disrupted by a flood that turned the valley into a sea. Many Indians drowned, but two survivors were made fertile by a "great man," leading to the repopulation of the world. One survivor became a world-renowned chief, gaining invincibility after nine nights of fasting and contemplation.

These stories reflect diverse cultural interpretations of natural events, blending mythological elements with historical observations.

# coyote, flood stories, creation myths

In recent California tribes, the prairie fox or coyote plays a significant role, especially in flood stories, more so than in Japanese folklore. The coyote is often depicted as a creator and benefactor of mankind. For instance, in the Asochimi (or Wappo) tribe’s flood story, all living beings were drowned except the coyote, who repopulated the world by planting owl, eagle, and hawk feathers, which later turned into humans and animals. The Papagos, a tribe living east of the California Bay and south of the Rio Gila, also feature the coyote in their myths, where it acts as a demi-god and helper to Montezuma during a flood. After the flood, the coyote is sent by Montezuma to explore the earth in the four cardinal directions. In New Mexico, the Zuñi have a flood story where they were driven from their mesa home into a valley by a flood and had to make an offering to calm the waters.

Further north, among the Xlinkites (Koljufchen) Indians in Alaska, the raven (Felch) is the central figure in their mythology. According to their flood story, the raven escapes a flood caused by a squid that swells and fills a house, leading to rising water levels. The raven and his mother escape by flying above the water. Another Xlinkite legend tells of humans surviving the flood in a large floating structure, which breaks apart upon returning to the water, leading to the diversification of languages. On the Pacific coast between 52° and 53° north latitude, the Bella-Coola Indians also revere the raven, which brings the sun to humans and controls the distance between the earth and the sun with a rope, causing a flood when it stretches the rope too much. This myth explains the origin of different languages and settlements among tribes.

# Mexican flood stories, Noah-like figures, bird-given languages

The text discusses several flood stories prevalent among the cultures of Mexico. These stories feature a survivor who escapes a catastrophic flood, similar to the biblical Noah, and continues the human lineage. Various groups, such as the Aztecs, Tlaxcaltecs, Zapotecs, and Mixtecs, have their own versions of the flood survivor, named differently in each culture, such as Coxcor, Teocipactli, Tezpi, and Nata. In these narratives, the survivor is often accompanied by a wife, and sometimes also by children, animals, and provisions, all saved in a raft or ship.

A common narrative involves a couple surviving the flood by hiding in a hollowed cypress trunk, referred to as Whahuete. They are named Corcor and Kochiquekal in some versions. After the waters recede, they settle at the hill of Colhuacan and multiply. Their offspring are initially born deaf until a dove or hummingbird brings them speech and diverse languages. From this group, the Toltecs, Aztecs, and Acolhuaș are believed to have descended.

Another version, particularly from Michoacán, tells the story of Tezpi, who saves his family and animals in a ship during the flood. Tezpi releases a vulture and later a hummingbird to check if the land is dry. The hummingbird returns with a green branch, indicating the floodwaters have receded. The ship lands at Colhuacan.

In the vicinity of Cholula, there is a legend about seven giant brothers who survive the flood by hiding in caves. One of them, Xelhua, builds a pyramid at Cholula as a monument for Tlaloc, the god who protected them during the flood. The construction is halted when the gods send fire, leaving the pyramid unfinished.

These stories are often derived from interpretations of Aztec pictographs and may have been influenced by early missionaries who recorded biblical fragments among the native traditions. The Codex Chimalpopoca provides another account where a man named Nata and his wife are warned by a deity to build a large cypress boat to escape the flood. After the flood, they emerge to find fish and transform some of them into dogs.

The text suggests that these stories might have been embellished over time and possibly influenced by Christian teachings, though the presence of flood legends among the ancient Mexicans is considered significant.

# Mixtecs flood myth, Quiché Popol Vuh, Muyscas myth

The Mixtecs, a people from Oaxaca, Mexico, have a tradition that includes a flood story, although details are sparse. According to a book from the Cuilapa monastery, the gods created the world, and humans appeared suddenly. A great flood occurred, destroying many divine offspring, after which humanity was restored and repopulated the Mixtec kingdom.

In Guatemala, the Quiché people, known for their relatively high culture and ancient documents, have the Popol Vuh, which tells of the creation of humans through three stages. Initially, humans were made from clay, followed by wooden humans, and finally from maize. Each creation was imperfect until the last, when humans were created from white and yellow corn, which pleased the gods.

The Nicaraguan Indians, during the time of conquest, also had a flood myth, preserved in examinations conducted by Spanish clergy. They believed the world was once destroyed by water, and the gods rebuilt it, populating it anew. The gods were said to have escaped the flood without drowning.

In the high plains of Santa Fé de Bogota, Colombia, the indigenous people have a myth involving a flood. According to this myth, a bearded old man named Botschika taught the Muyscas how to live and cultivate the land. His wife, through her magic, caused a flood by swelling the Funza River, which was later diverted through the Tequendama waterfall, allowing the land to dry and be cultivated again by the survivors.

These myths, while containing elements similar to the biblical flood narrative, such as a destruction by water, differ significantly in other aspects and reflect unique cultural contexts and natural settings.

# flood myths, floating mountains, survival legends

Peruvians have several flood myths, one of which involves a great flood that darkened the sun for five days and wiped out all life except for a shepherd, his family, and herd. Before the flood, the shepherd noticed his llamas' unusual behavior and was guided by them to safety on Mount Ancasmarca. The mountain floated on the rising waters, and on the fifth day, the waters receded, allowing the earth to be repopulated by the shepherd’s descendants.

Another Peruvian legend describes two brothers escaping a flood by climbing a floating mountain. After the waters receded, they encountered mysterious parakeets that prepared meals for them. One brother captured an ara parrot, which became his wife, and their children became the ancestors of the Canaris tribe.

Among the Araucanians, there is a legend of a great flood following a violent earthquake and volcanic eruptions. Survivors climbed a three-pronged mountain called Tehuel, which floated on the water. The Araucanians now seek refuge on mountains during earthquakes, fearing subsequent floods.

In Haiti, the legend of Jaia, a cacique who accidentally unleashed a flood by breaking a jar containing the bones of his son, which had turned into fish, leading to the flooding of the earth and the formation of the Antilles.

British Guiana's Acawoio tribe believes that a flood was caused by Sigu, who felled a magical tree and sealed its hollow stump with water. When a curious monkey disturbed the seal, the water flooded the earth. Sigu and his herd found refuge on a high palm, and after the waters receded, the earth was repopulated.

The Arawak tribe in British Guiana recounts two destructions of the world, first by fire and then by a flood, due to human misdeeds. A compassionate chief named Marerewana saved himself and his family in a boat tied to a tree, ensuring they stayed near their home.

The neighboring Makusi tribe’s legend involves a flood sent by the spirit Makunaima, from which only one man survived by releasing a rat that returned with an ear of corn. This survivor repopulated the earth by throwing stones behind him.

These legends often include elements of ancient traditions, such as the floating mountain and throwing stones, alongside modern Christian influences like the emergence of a woman from a deep-sleeping man.

# flood legends, indigenous myths, geographic distribution

The text discusses flood legends across various cultures, focusing particularly on South American Indian tribes, where such tales are prevalent, especially in the Amazon region. According to these legends, during the great flood, humans were almost entirely wiped out, except for a single man and woman who survived on Mount Tamanaku. After the waters receded, they repopulated the earth by throwing stone kernels of the Moriche palm; men emerged from kernels thrown by the man, and women from those thrown by the woman.

Hans Staden, a European explorer who lived among the Tupinamba tribe in 1550, recounted a similar legend involving a great fire instead of a flood. A lone survivor dug a cave to protect himself from the flames, emerging once the danger had passed to find a barren landscape. Sararuma, a magical figure, provided him with seeds to grow a forest.

Flood legends are distributed globally but are notably absent in some regions like Arabia, Central Asia, North Asia, China, Japan, and Africa. They are present in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout the Americas. These legends vary significantly in detail, suggesting multiple origins rather than a single source.

Jacob Grimm suggested that the diversity of flood legends could not be solely attributed to the biblical account, indicating that these stories often reflect local conditions and experiences. Comparative ethnology indicates that legends arise from the human mind's nature and can migrate between cultures, adopting local characteristics. This suggests that the commonality of flood legends is due to shared human experiences and imagination rather than a singular, universal event. The text concludes by questioning why only the flood legend persists in many cultures, rather than other biblical stories.

# flood legends, biblical influences, dove detail

The text discusses the characteristics of flood legends across various cultures, noting similarities and differences compared to the biblical account of Noah’s flood. It highlights that while the concept of a flood as divine punishment is present in many authentic flood legends, the specific detail of a dove returning with an olive branch is more distinctive and often found among indigenous peoples. This detail, along with the dispatching of animals or birds to explore the post-flood world, is described in several legends. The text also mentions the common feature of a ship or boat coming to rest on a high mountain, such as Mount Ararat, and suggests that this feature is natural and does not necessarily indicate borrowing from the biblical story.

Furthermore, the text notes that certain other features like the use of a rope to tether the rescue vessel are recurrent in some flood legends but not in the biblical version. It concludes by mentioning that the absence of flood legends among the neighboring Arab peoples and the unique mythology of the Iranians make a universal origin for these legends less likely. The author argues that while some elements may suggest borrowing, others are naturally occurring and do not prove a common origin for all flood legends.

# flood legends, biblical influence, natural causes

The text discusses the absence of a flood legend among the Egyptians, who were neighbors of the Hebrews and Babylonians. An Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription, titled "The new world order after the destruction of the sinful human race," supposedly found near the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I, is claimed to represent a flood legend. However, this inscription does not explicitly mention a water flood but rather the destruction of humanity due to sinfulness, similar to the biblical tradition. The text also mentions that Egyptian traditions generally remain within mythological frameworks and do not significantly align with biblical flood narratives beyond the concept of divine punishment sparing the chosen ones.

The text then delves into an overview of original and borrowed flood legends, distinguishing between those that are genuinely native and those influenced by the Chaldean-Hebrew narrative. It notes that the influence of the Middle Eastern flood story has been extensive, particularly in America, where many legends show a mix of original and borrowed elements. Examples of what are considered original and genuine flood legends are listed, including those from regions such as Babylon, Persia, India, Tibet, and various indigenous American groups. Additionally, several legends are noted as being more influenced by the Babylonian narrative.

Lastly, the text touches upon the natural causes of floods, highlighting that while rain and river floods are significant, they are often less impactful than those caused by hurricanes or earthquakes. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and the Simoda earthquake of 1854 are cited as examples where seismic activity generated waves that crossed large oceanic distances, emphasizing the power of earthquake-induced floods.

# tsunamis, earthquakes, flood-legends

The earthquake that struck Arica, Peru on August 13, 1868, generated a powerful tsunami that spread across the Pacific Ocean. This tsunami reached the Sandwich Islands on August 14, and the coasts of New Zealand and Australia on August 15. The entire water mass along the shaken coastal region, from deep ocean floors to the surface, was agitated and displaced, entering into a swinging motion that lasted about 60 hours. The tsunami created concentric wave circles that extended south, north, and westward, covering almost a third of the Earth's surface in the Pacific Ocean. The tsunami's effects were felt as far as the east coast of New Zealand's South Island, which was 6000 nautical miles from Arica. The harbor of Lyttelton was exposed due to the sea's retreat, followed by a return with a three-meter-high wall of water, flooding the shore up to a meter above the highest spring tide mark, repeating three times.

Earthquake-generated tsunamis often cause significant destruction, especially in flat coastal areas and islands. These events are well-preserved in the traditions of affected peoples and have inspired various flood legends. Examples include legends from the Prince Wales Peninsula, Makah and Wasgo traditions, Peru, and the Arauaners. Flood legends found in high mountainous regions might stem from local events like river floods or breakthroughs of lakes, rather than widespread inundations. For instance, the breakthrough of the Rio Junza in Santa Fé de Bogota and the flooding of the Shyok valley due to ice barrier breaches are examples of such localized events. Similar flood legends exist in Tibet, Kashmir, and Wales, often referring to the formation and breaking of lakes. The Yellow River floods in China and the Tempe Valley formation in Greece are additional examples.

Fossilization also contributed to flood legends, with indigenous people noticing fossilized marine life on high mountains and attributing them to ancient floods. For example, in Samoa, it was believed that fish once swam where land now stands, and as waters receded, many fish turned to stone. Similar views were found among Central Eskimos and Greenlanders. The Society Islanders' flood legend also references fossils of corals and shells on high mountains, suggesting that these could only have been deposited during a great flood.

# flood legends, fossil evidence, cyclone floods

The passage discusses the evidence supporting ancient flood stories and their origins, drawing on observations from both modern indigenous peoples and classical antiquity. Notable figures like Herodotus, Eratosthenes, and Xanthus noted fossils and marine remains far inland, suggesting past inundations. Additionally, Pomponius Mela and Ovid mentioned similar findings in North Africa, connecting these phenomena to former marine landscapes. Tertullian linked mountain fossilization to past underwater conditions.

The text also explores how natural disasters such as cyclones and tsunamis might have inspired flood legends. An example cited is the Indian cyclone of November 1, 1864, which devastated the Coromandel region, leading to extensive flooding and loss of life. This event illustrates how local catastrophes can be perceived as global floods by survivors.

The passage concludes that various geological and meteorological events, such as earthquakes, river breaches, and whirlwind storms, have contributed to the creation of flood legends across different cultures. These widespread occurrences suggest that flood myths are not based on a single event but rather on multiple local experiences.

The second part of the text lists several publications related to anthropology, archaeology, and cultural studies. These include journals like "Globus" and "Archive for Anthropology," books on Homer’s locations in the Odyssey, ethnological research on Greece and Italy, and studies on prehistoric archaeology. Each publication is described with details about its authors, editions, and publishers, providing an overview of scholarly works from the late 19th century.
