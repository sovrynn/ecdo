Preface.

In the following treatise on flood legends in general, it is about bringing the ethnographic and folklore perspective into focus. I want to give the people's thought in the flood legends, which has been neglected in their consideration, its rightful place. It does not occur to me to increase the interpretations of the Hebrew flood report, which have been pursued with special zeal by learned theologians as well as laypeople for centuries. The lector, like its model, the Chaldean report, has only been drawn in comparatively and brought to the forefront because of its great influence on the traditions of other peoples, which it also deserves due to its content and because it is the most detailed and vivid among all known flood reports.

In numerous writings and commentaries on the Great Flood, the flood legends of other peoples, especially those of natural peoples, only appear incidentally, especially when it comes to proving the universality of the Great Flood. However, the material brought in was often insufficient and frequently uncritical, naturally enough because theologians rarely have the opportunity to study relevant ethnographic literature. There is no general compilation of flood legends, even though much has been collected individually. Yet, such a compilation is important when it comes to elucidating the question of the universality of the Great Flood, apart from its folkloric value. In what follows, an attempt and beginning will be made in this direction, which is certainly still very expandable. Here, criticism must pay attention to what is genuine and original and what has passed under the powerful influence of the spread of Christianity from biblical tradition into the traditions of other peoples. It will also become apparent that the flood legends, which are often assumed to be "a common heritage of all peoples of the earth from the early times of humanity," are missing in large ethnic groups, thus not being universal at all, and then that they cannot be traced back to a major event narrated in the Bible, but rather that an independent origin, based on local natural events, is the rule.

In the following, I first present the collection of flood legends. I begin with the Near Eastern ones, followed by those of the Asian continent, and mention the few traces found on Asian islands. Then follows what our continent possesses. Africa proves to be barren ground for our purposes, while in Australia and the vast area of the South Seas, flood legends again prevail. Then follow those of America, from the Eskimos in the north to the Araucanians in the south. Here follow the general results: The spread of flood legends is examined and it is shown that they do not have a common origin and cannot be traced back solely to the Chaldean-Hebrew report. However, the massive influence of the same is followed, and it is summarized which flood legends are independent and authentic and which show influence or are borrowed from the biblical narrative. Finally, I discuss the natural causes that brought about the emergence of the flood legends.

1. The Chaldean flood report, as far as we know so far, is the oldest. It is not, as was originally assumed, an echo or copy of the Hebrew one, but the original. This Babylonian tradition was previously only known in the form in which Alexander Polyhistor had reported it from Berossus (time of Alexander the Great). It reads as follows:

The pre-flood king Xisuthros was revealed by Cronus that on the 15th of the month Daisios, humans would perish through a great flood of water, and commanded him to bury the existing writings in Sippara, build a ship, enter with his relatives and friends, take food and drink, and also include birds and four-legged animals on board. Xisuthros built the ship 15 arrow shots long and two arrow shots wide and entered with his wife, children, and friends. The flood came, but soon receded. Xisuthros released some scouting birds, which returned because they could not find anything to eat or a resting place. After

some days, he sent out birds again, which also returned, but had mud between their feet. When he sent them out for the third time, they did not return anymore. Now Xisuthros opened the roof of the ship and saw that it stood on a mountain; he then went out with his wife, daughter, and the ship's helmsman, prayed, built an altar, and offered sacrifices to the gods; subsequently, he and the others who had come out disappeared. Those left in the ship later came out, found him nowhere, but heard him calling from heaven: They should honor the gods; he and those who came out with him were taken up into the dwelling of the gods because of their piety; the others should go back to Babylon, dig up the writings hidden in Sippara, and hand them over to the people; the land where they were located was Armenia. Now they also offered sacrifices to the gods, went to Babylon, retrieved the writings from Sippara, built cities and temples, and rebuilt Babylon. Remains of the ship can still be seen today (at the time of Berosus) on the mountain of the North farmers in Armenia, and the tar scraped off the ship serves as medicine*).

*) Berosus was a Babylonian priest around 260 BC. The fragments preserved by him, which we received second-hand, were published by Richter. Berosus Fragments of the Chaldeans. Leipzig 1825.
Chaldean Flood Report.

While it was earlier assumed that this flood report, which strikingly corresponds with the one from Genesis, was borrowed from it, we now know with certainty that this is not the case, but that it stems from an older original source, which in turn served as the source for the biblical narrative. The Chaldean flood report discovered by the Assyriologist G. Smith in 1872 confirms this, and the assumption that the biblical flood narrative alone has a moral background, the punishment of sinful mankind by God, becomes invalid.

Although the cuneiform tablets found by George Smith date only from the seventh century BCE, their text is undoubtedly much older and goes back to an original dating from no later than 2000 BCE*).

Several Babylonian literary works deal with the description of the flood, two of which are intertwined by the author of a large epic in twelve books that describes the adventures of a sun hero, or Gilgamesh or Jšdubar — the name is not yet exactly deciphered. Jšdubar is identical with the Nimrod of the Bible, who ruled over Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh and founded Nineveh. His grandson is Shamash-napish-tim, nicknamed Adapa or Hasisatra, the Chaldean Xisuthros. This national epic, whose eleventh book forms the Chaldean flood report, is based on an astronomical-allegorical foundation, as each book corresponds to a sign of the zodiac, the eleventh to that of the Water Bearer. The eleventh month is called the "rain month" in Sumerian-Akkadian. Xisuthros tells the story of the flood to Gilgamesh, as he came to him at the shore of the river of the dead at the mouth of the Euphrates to recover from an illness and discussed matters with him far from the world. In Haupt's translation*) it reads (with some omissions) as follows:

You know the city of Surippak, which lies on the Euphrates. This city was already old when the gods decided to create a flood within it; all the great gods, their father Anu, their counselor, the fearsome Bel, their throne-bearer Abar, their leader Gunuzi. But the god Ea, the lord of incomprehensible wisdom, was with them and announced their decision to me. Man of Surippak, he said, leave your

house and build a ship; they want to destroy the seed of life; therefore preserve it and bring all kinds of seed of life onto the ship you are to build. X (unclear number) cubits shall be its length and Y (unclear number) its width and height, cover it with a roof. Do not close the door behind you until I notify you. Then enter and bring food, your possessions, your family, your servants and maids, and your closest friends onto the ship. The livestock of the field, the wild animals of the field, I myself will send to you.

Then I built the ship and equipped it with provisions. I divided it into compartments, I inspected the seams and filled them. Three sar (large unit of measurement) of bitumen I poured over its outside, three sar of bitumen over its inside. Everything I owned I brought onto the ship, all my gold, silver, and seed of life of every kind, all my male and female servants, the livestock of the field, the wild animals of the field, my closest friends. When now the sun god brought the appointed time, a voice spoke: "In the evening the heavens will rain destruction, enter the ship and close the door." With trepidation, I awaited the sunset. Fearful, yet I entered the ship and closed the door. To the Buzurkurgal, the helmsman, I entrusted the mighty structure with its cargo.

Then dark clouds rose from the depths of the sky, in the middle of which the storm god let his thunder sound. The powerful storm god unleashed the whirlwinds, the god Adar caused the canals to overflow, the gods of the great underground waters brought forth mighty floods, the earth trembled, the waves of the storm god rose to the sky, all light turned into darkness. The goddess Ishtar cried like a woman in labor and exclaimed: "Thus everything is turned into mud, just as I prophesied to the gods. But I gave birth to my people not to fill the sea like fish spawn." Then the gods wept with her over the spirits of the great underground waters.

Six days and seven nights wind, flood, and storm held sway. On the seventh day, however, the flood subsided, the sea retreated into its bed, and the storm and flood ceased.

I, however, sailed through the sea, loudly lamenting that the sites of men were turned into mud, the corpses floated around like tree trunks. I opened a window and when I saw the light of the day, I shuddered in tears. I sailed over the lands, now a terrible sea, and there the land rose twelve units high. After steering towards the land
Chaldean Flood Report.

Rizir, the ship was held fast by the mountain of the land Rizir. Thus, I waited for six days. On the seventh day, I let a dove fly, as there was no resting place, it returned. Then I let a swallow fly, as there was no resting place, it returned. Then I let a raven fly, and as it saw the receding water, it did not return. Then I let everything out. I offered a sacrifice and erected an altar on the summit of the mountain.

In the Chaldean report, the gods now appear due to the sacrifice and get into a dispute with each other about the flood and its consequences. Bel is angry and wants to let no soul escape, he even wants to destroy the saved; but Ea calms him and demands that no flood should happen again. Bel is satisfied and elevates the pious and wise Xisuthros among the gods.

The criticism generally assumes now that we have to search for the original source of the biblical account in this Babylonian flood report. Both refer to the same event, and the similarities, which are obvious (especially with the second, Jehovistic tradition of the Bible), are so striking that they hardly need to be highlighted. As for the differences, the polytheistic coloring stands out against the monotheistic one of the Bible. Sifuthros (= Hafisabra or Adrahafis, that is, the Wise and Pious) is not only rescued from the water but also deified. The duration of the flood in the Bible and in the Chaldean report differs. However, a significant and characteristic difference lies in the fact that the Babylonian report shows the habits of a seafaring people, while the biblical one has an inland coloring, as Lenorman has pointed out.

The biblical narrative bears the stamp of a people living in the heart of the land and ignorant of the matters of navigation. In Genesis, the name of the ark, tebah, means "chest," and not "ship"; there is no mention of launching the ark; no reference to the sea or navigation; no pilot. On the contrary, in the epic of Ouk, everything indicates that it was composed among a seafaring people; each circumstance reflects the customs and traditions of the Persian Gulf coast dwellers.

The land of Nizir, where Sifuthros's vessel came to rest, belonged to the mountainous regions of Pir Mam in northeastern Babylonia; the mountain of Nizir may correspond to Rowandiz, the highest peak of this part of Asia; it represented in ancient Adic mythology the Olympus, the dwelling place of the gods. Ararat denotes Armenia in the cuneiform texts.

In both accounts, the Babylonian and the biblical, the flood is understood as divine punishment; in both, the construction of the vessel is precisely commanded, a seven-day grace period is granted, and the thanksgiving sacrifice after the flood is well-received.

One story has flowed from the other. "Now, through the high age of the Babylonian account, which was at least already in existence in writing around 2000 BC, a borrowing by the Hebrews can be assumed. Therefore, only the possibility remains that the Hebrews had already taken the legend with them during their emigration from Ur in Chaldea, or first learned it during the exile in Babylon." The latter was shown by Delitzsch.

2. Following the Chaldean flood report comes the second oldest, that of the Bible, and this is the one that, through its wide dissemination by Christian messengers, with its captivating content that unusually stimulates even the childlike mind, exerted a powerful influence on the traditions of other peoples and interwove with numerous indigenous flood legends. Just as in various parts of the Pentateuch, two different source writings can be distinguished in the flood report of Genesis, which were fused into a whole. The Elohist and Jehovist traditions, as they are called, agree in the main, but differ in some details. Regardless of what the factual core of the biblical narrative may be and what relationship it has to the Chaldean flood tradition, its value lies in its religious content; for, although the idea of divine judgment over sinful humanity is expressed in the Chaldean and many other flood legends, nowhere does the divine judgment stand out as sharply as in the biblical one. Hence also the complete designation as "Flood of Sin"**).

To delve further into the biblical narrative is not my task and has been abundantly handled by theologians and laypeople over the centuries, with no shortage of skeptics on one side and bizarre explainers of all details of the great event on the other, where it was particularly insisted that the entire earth was covered by the flood, while reasonable criticism has now arrived at the view that the flooding refers only to the part of the earth known to the Hebrews, which was very limited, such that the Black Sea, Persia, Arabia, Rubien, and the eastern Mediterranean formed its borders.

The natural foundations of the old flood reports of Borderasia were first developed by Eduard Süß in a manner sufficient for science and thereby definitively eliminated vague interpretations of "afterglows of the diluvian era"**). Süß shows how the natural event known under the name of the Flood occurred in the lower Euphrates and was associated with extensive and devastating flooding of the Mesopotamian lowlands. The main cause was a considerable earthquake in the region of the Persian Gulf or nearby, preceded by several minor tremors. It is likely that during the period of the most intense shocks, a cyclone entered from the south via the Persian Gulf. Süß's development using cuneiform documents is clear and convincing; he also shows that the flood did not extend beyond the lower courses of the Euphrates and Tigris or even over the entire earth. Such an assumption is justified only from the perspective that the cuneiform flood report also provides an accurate description of the flood that took place. The storm, the whirlwinds, the rising of the canals, the breaking forth of underground waters, the shaking of the earth, the covering of it with mud, the retreat of the sea to its shores—these are all mentioned, all are also characteristic signs of an earthquake flood, combined with a cyclone.
Asia. 3. Our task now is, advancing geographically, to introduce and examine flood legends of other countries and how far these are originally or influenced by the Babylonian-Hebrew account. Among the nearest neighbors of the Babylonians and Hebrews, the Egyptians and Arabs, there is no flood legend, which we will return to later. On the other hand, it appears in Persia, where we, in a land lacking streams and rain, unfamiliar with floods, would scarcely expect to encounter it. Not in the oldest parts of the Zendavesta, but in a much younger offshoot of the sacred literature of the Persians, in the Bundehesh, we find a flood legend that, however, offers no analogy to the biblical report*). According to Chapter Seven of the aforementioned book, during the early times of the world, during the war with Ahriman, the star Tistar appeared in three forms: in the body of a man, a horse, and an ox, in the world to send rain into it. The earth was then filled with harmful creatures which the evil principle had created. Tistar rained for ten days with each of his bodies, thus for a total of 30 days. When he had rained in his first form with drops the size of a small bowl, the water rose to the height of a man on the earth and all the harmful creatures had to die. Then a heavenly wind carried the water away, but the seed of the destroyed harmful creatures remained on the earth and caused poison and decay. For the second time, Tistar descended onto the earth in the form of a white horse to rain anew. But the demon Apaosha met him in the form of a black horse to prevent him from carrying out his plan. For a long time, the battle swayed, and only through the supernatural aid that Ormazd sends to Tistar is victory finally awarded to him; he strikes Apaosha with the help of lightning fire, which he uses as his weapon, just as the demon Cpendschaghra, who accompanies him. The struck demon emits a terrible cry, which we still hear during storms today. Tistar then rained again, and the poison of the harmful animals remaining on the earth mixed into this water, which became salty because of it. Again, a great wind lifted this water in three days to the ends of the earth; from this, three large and 23 small seas emerged.

These reports of the Bundehesh are confirmed mainly in the Avesta; they are an ancient Indo-Germanic myth, as Spiegel emphasizes. The main point here is the explanation of the storm, the flood is secondary; this representation cannot be traced back to the biblical flood. "There is no relation to the human race; it even seems as though the latter was not yet thought to exist at this great rain. Furthermore, nothing is said about how the human race was saved through one of its representatives from the great flood; these seem to me to be important points that should not be missing, and therefore I do not believe that we can see this myth in connection with the flood in an early relationship" *). This appears so clear and simple to me that I do not understand how Semitic influences could be assumed here.

4. The Vedic literature of India contains narratives of a flood in the prose writings belonging to the second, so-called Brahmanic period; in contrast, the older hymns lack them, while detailed flood reports are found again in the later epic poems and in the even later Puranas, where they form a well-known subject in the religious traditions of the Indian people. Three of Vishnu's avatars or incarnations are linked with a flood, those of the fish, the turtle, and the boar. Vishnu saves mankind from destruction by water in all three cases by assuming the form of a fish, a turtle, or a boar.

The oldest report, found in the Satapatha-Brahmana, reads in Max Müller's translation*) as follows:

In the morning, they brought water to Manu, as is still done today for washing hands. While he washed himself, a fish came into his hands. The fish spoke to him: Hold me, and I will save you. Manu asked: From what do you want to save me? The fish replied: A flood will carry away all these creatures, and I will save you from it. Manu asked: How can I hold you? The fish replied: While we are small, there is much destruction for us, for the fish eats the fish. Therefore, hold me first in a pot. When I grow out of it, dig a hole and hold me there. When I grow out of that, transfer me to the sea; then I will be safe from destruction. He soon became a large fish, for such a fish grows very large. He said: In this and that year, the flood will come. So when you have built a ship, think of me. And when the flood rises, step into the ship, and I will save you from it. After Manu had kept him like this, he transferred him to the sea. In the same year, however, which the fish had foretold, Manu built a ship and remembered him. And as the flood rose, he stepped into the ship. Then the fish swam towards Manu, and he tied the rope of the ship to its horn and rushed towards the northern mountain. The fish said: I have saved you; now tie the ship to a tree. May the water not cut you off while you stay on the mountain. As soon as the water recedes, go down slowly with it; hence this place on the northern mountain is called "Manu's Descent." The flood had carried away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained.

The subsequent new creation of the human race from a daughter of Manu, born from a sacrificial offering, does not belong here and has no relation to the Genesis narrative, while the actual Indian flood report indeed shows, as is immediately apparent, agreement with that of the Bible.
Andree, Flood Legends.
18 Comparison of the Indian and Biblical Reports.

Two views now stand in sharp opposition to each other, of which one supports the independence of the Indian narrative, and the other traces it back to Semitic sources. M. Müller (a. a. D.) decidedly supports the independence, he points out every Semitic influence at least to the old doubts and assumes that a specific local natural event is the basis of the old Indian flood legends. Against others, such as Bournouf and Lenormant, who recognize the Chaldean form of the flood tradition in India, adopted as a result of a communication that commercial relations between the two countries make historically quite natural*).

However, it is impossible for me to see a great agreement with the Hebrew in this Indian form of the flood legends. A flood here and there - that matches, but the main thing remains the fish in India, and an ethical background, as in the Bible, is not present, apart from the fact that other distinctive details are completely missing, unless one counts that the fish announces the flood in advance and commands Manu to build a ship.

Younger than this legend in the Satapatha-Brahmana, which was recorded shortly before the birth of Christ, is the one in the great epic poem Mahabharata*, where it is simply referred to as the "Fish Story." Everything revolves around him, who is Brahma, the greatest god. First, he is placed in a vessel by Manu, growing out of it, just as later from a lake, then the Ganges, finally the sea. The flood appears in the Mahabharata as a sensing departure of the earth. Manu goes into a ship with the seven holy Rishis (singers) and takes the seeds of all plants with him. So that the ship does not perish in the great, commonly imagined flood, it is tied to the horn of the enormous Brahma-fish by Manu, landing on the highest mountain of Himawan, which is now called "Shipmooring" (Raubband-hanam). Only after this flood does Manu create living beings, among whom the woman is not mentioned.

A third form of the Indian flood story, which resembles the Hebrew one more in details, stands in the *) Fr.3 Bopp, The Flood along with three other of the most important episodes of the Mahabharata. Berlin 1829. 2*
20 The Flood Story in Bhagavata Purana.

Bhagavata Purana. Here, the holy Vedas are stolen from the sleeping Brahma by a demon while he speaks them in his sleep. To now rescue the true Vedas and prevent them from being falsified, the flood occurs; it should begin on the seventh day, as Manu previously announces, a statement that is not present in the other Indian versions of the story. The fish here is Vishnu, and the intention to save the seven Rishis, who preserve the Vedas, moves more into the background than the rescue of Manu. An enrichment of the story in Bhagavata Purana is also that, besides the seeds of the plants, pairs of all animals are taken on board, which can indeed be a later Semitic influence, since this feature is missing in the two earlier forms of the story.

Max Müller, who speaks out most decidedly against Semitic borrowing of the story, believes that if the similarities between the Near Eastern and Indian stories are based on borrowing from the former, then the differences must be equally high and explainable, which could have its difficulties. The surprising similarity that the flood was announced seven days in advance, as in Genesis "for in seven days I will send rain," is only present in the later Bhagavata Purana and is probably purely coincidental. This would only be a subordinate fact taken over, while the most important things, which one could have had for free, were not borrowed. This argument speaks strongly against the theory of borrowing and can still be used frequently.

5. Among the tent Gypsies of Transylvania, H. v. Wlislocki found the following flood story: There was a time when people lived forever and no sorrow, no illness tormented them. Meat, fruits were abundant, milk and wine flowed in the rivers. People and animals lived happily and without fear of death. Once, an old man came to the country and asked for lodging at a man's house. He stayed in the hut and was well entertained by the man's wife. When the man left the next day, he gave the host a small fish in a small vessel and said, "Keep this fish and do not eat it! If I return after nine days and you give me back the fish, I will reward you." Then he left. The woman of the house took the little fish and spoke to her husband, "Dear man! What if we were to fry the fish?" The man replied, "I promised the old man to return the little fish to him! You must also swear to me to spare the little fish and keep it until the old man returns!" The woman swore and said, "I will not kill the little fish, I will keep it, God willing." Two days passed, and the woman thought about how the little fish might taste. It must have a wonderful flavor, since the old man values it so highly and does not let it be fried but drags it around with him in the world. She thought back and forth until she finally took the little fish out of the vessel and threw it onto the coals, but barely had she done this when the first lightning struck the earth and killed the woman. It began to rain, the rivers rose out of their beds and flooded the entire land. On the ninth day, the old man appeared at his host's and shouted, "You kept your promise and did not kill the little fish. Take a wife, gather your relatives, and build a boat in which you will be saved. All beings and all humans will now drown in the water, and you will survive. Also take animals and seeds from the trees and herbs so that you can repopulate the earth later." Then the old man disappeared, and the man did as he was commanded. It rained for a year, and nothing could be seen but water and sky. After a year, the water receded, and the man climbed ashore with his second wife and relatives along with the animals. They now had to work, build, and sow to live. Hardship and toil were now their lives; added to this were illness and death, so that they only slowly increased, and many, many thousand years have passed since then until the people were as numerous as they once were and still are today. I have attached these flood stories of the Transylvanian tent Gypsies here because of the Indian origin of this people, without expressing my agreement with Wlislocki's view, who assumes that it has sprung from ancient Indian tradition. I can only discover in this Gypsy story a mixture of the biblical Fall of Man with the biblical Flood, a mixture that repeats itself often. The apple of Eve is simply replaced by a fish. The Gypsy Eve appears as the greedy and tempting one, the fish is secondary. The latter does not play any role like in the Indian flood report; it does not grow out of anything nor does it pull the saving ship through the floods. If one compares the younger Indian version in the Mahabharata, the fish in the Gypsy story is again not—Brahma to bless; in the Indian story, people and animals are only created after the flood, while among the Gypsies, they are already present beforehand and are only replanted after being destroyed by the flood. Some features of the Gypsy version, such as the killing of the woman by lightning, are later additions.

Geographically connected to this are still circulating flood stories in the border and hinterland of India, whose connection with the old Indian flood stories cannot be proven, and which often have a distinctly local character and point to the breakthrough of frozen lakes and mountains.

6. Samuel Turner heard at the border of Bhutan and Tibet the natives tell: Tibet was completely flooded in earlier times. The removal of the water covering the whole surface is attributed to the miraculous intervention of the god Gya. Out of compassion for the few natives who inhabited Tibet at that time and were not much better than monkeys, Gya let the water flow towards Bengal and made the poor race that populated the land afterwards more human through teachers he sent them*).

Flood Stories in Kashmir and among the Kols. 25

7. The Lepchas in Darjeeling (in the Himalayas) possess a story of a flood during which a pair of humans sought refuge on top of Mount Tendong*).

8. In Kashmir, the whole land was originally covered with water, and an evil spirit caused constant damage to the fruits, animals, and humans there. Then Kashyapa, a grandson of Brahma, noticed that the waters covering the valley were flowing away. Here, Vishnu was helpful, opening the mountains near Baramulla to provide drainage for the water. Kashyapa repopulated the dried land again**).

9. The Mundaris, a tribe of the Kols in East India, tell: Singbonga, the highest being, created humans from earth. However, the humans created for good soon became bad; they did not want to wash or work but always dance and drink. Therefore, he became very angry and sent a great flood. Sengle-Daa, i.e., Firewater, he let flow from heaven, which killed all humans. Only two, a brother and a sister, hid themselves under a Tiriba tree and were rescued. The wood of this tree looks very dark, as if burned.

26 Flood Stories of the Kols.

This, people say, is the result of that firewater. But God did not want the world to sink again. Therefore, he created the snake Lurbing to end the floods. It blows its soul up to the sky and becomes a rainbow, stopping the rain showers. While the rainbow stands in the sky, the snake is dead; only after its disappearance does it come back to life. Hence, the saying of the Mundaris when they see the rainbow: Lurbing has fallen to the ground, or: it will not rain anymore because Lurbing has destroyed the rain. The Uraons, another tribal group, tell differently: The flood had destroyed all humans, except a brother and a sister who hid in the rice fields of the village Verafita in Chotia Nagpur in the cave of a large crab*).

The beginnings of missionary work among the Kols date back to the thirties; whether the biblical echoes in the later recorded story came through these remains to be seen. Despite the secret precautions, it does not appear untouched, as shown by the beginning strongly leaning on the biblical creation story. The anger over the humans he created who had become sinful, the Singbonga destroying all but two, the very suspicious rainbow, the repopulating of the earth after the flood—all these are biblical traits.

10. Pulugu, the creator in the mythology of the Andamanese (Mincopi), had created a man named Tomo and his wife Elewadi. These first humans drowned in the sea and were transformed into a whale and a crab. Thus, the land (Botaemi) passed to their grandchildren and descendants, known as Tomola, who, however, disregarded the commandments imposed upon humans by Pulugu at the time of creation, causing Pulugu to become angry and send a great flood without warning, covering the entire land and destroying all living things. Only four persons, two men and two women, whose names are given, survived because they happened to be in a boat at the time of the catastrophe. When the waters receded, they found themselves near Botaemi, where they landed and discovered that all living creatures had perished. However, Pulugu created the animals and birds anew. The four surviving humans suffered particularly from not having fire. Then the bird Luaratut, an icebird, appeared and stole fire from the heavens for them*). It is noted (p. 157) that it is extremely unlikely that their legends resulted from the teaching of missionaries or others who might have been supposed to have landed on their shores in bygone years. This is explained further, adding that the islanders attribute all their superstitious beliefs and customs to the "time before the flood." However, I will not assert the authenticity and rather consider the story influenced; a pair of humans, as in the biblical creation, appears, their descendants disregard divine commandments, and thus, as punishment, the destructive flood, etc.

11. Among the Karens in Burma, missionary F. Mason found the following tradition. Long ago, when the earth was flooded, two brothers sought refuge on a raft in their distress. The water rose and rose until it finally reached the sky. Then the younger brother climbed a mango tree, sat down, and started eating the fruit; but the suddenly falling water left him hanging in the tree*).

12. Among the Changrai, a mountain tribe in Cambodia, French missionaries found a flood tradition similar to the biblical one**).

30 Flood Stories of the Binna$. plants. Then they said to each other: What shall we do without children and grandchildren? Later, the woman became pregnant, and in her thighs*); from the right thigh, she bore a boy, from the left a girl, and from these, all humans descend. When the humans multiplied greatly, God looked at them with favor and counted their number. Also, the Mantras, on Mount Ophir, let their ancestors come from heaven in a large ship built by God, floating on the earth's waters until it came to rest on a mountain of the peninsula, where it can still be seen**). If this flood story of the Binna$ is well recorded, it does not seem innocent to me. It is of theosmogonic nature, showing a mixture of the biblical creation story with the flood account, even verbal echoes, such as God looking at the humans with favor and counting their number. The childbirth from the thighs can also be modeled after the emergence of Eve from Adam's rib. Thus, here are biblical traits on home ground.

15. The East Asian island world generally does not know the flood stories; there are slight echoes there that owe their existence to very local events. Only in the continuation of the Malay world, among the Polynesians, do flood stories appear more frequently, among the latter perhaps well-developed as they had already separated from the Malay main branch and possibly prompted by tsunamis that swept through the Pacific Ocean from America.

From Seram, it is said: Folk traditions report that after a great flood that submerged the entire world, the mountain Noesakoe appeared, covered with large trees, whose leaves had the shape of the female pudendum. Only three people inhabited this mountain; they were named Oeli Lima, Oeli Sira, and Oeli Asé. Through the bird called Marapati, they were informed that other mountains had also emerged *).

Half-island of Celebes, formed by a flood, as the natives told it.
17. Once some Dayak women (in Borneo) went out to gather young bamboo shoots for food. When they found the shoots, they walked through the jungle and came upon a long fallen tree, as they believed. They sat on it and began peeling the bamboo shoots, when to their greatest surprise, the tree began to bleed. Just then some men appeared, who immediately noticed that what the women were sitting on was not a tree, but a large boa constrictor lying motionless. The men killed the animal, cut it up, and took the meat home to eat. When they now roasted the snake pieces, there arose a peculiar noise in the pan and simultaneously it began to rain heavily. The rain continued until all the mountains, except the highest, were under water, and the whole world was flooded because those men had killed and roasted the snake. All people perished, except one woman who fled to a very high mountain. There she found a dog at the foot of a liana and

Flood tale from the Philippines. 33 when she noticed that the root of the liana was warm, she thought perhaps fire could be obtained from it. So she took two pieces of this wood, rubbed them together, and thus obtained fire. Thus fire-drilling and the first fire after the great flood were created. The woman and the fire-driller, whom the Dayaks give the attributes of a living being, produced the Sim pang - impang, a half-body with an eye, an ear, an arm, a leg (which later became a whole man)*). The sequel of the story has nothing more to do with the flood.

A genuine, unambiguous tradition.

18. Professor J. Blumentritt writes to me that he can provide no information about flood tales from the Philippines; where this distinguished expert speaks, further research will likely lead to no other result. Relevant here is what the Bisayans (inhabitants of the islands between Luzon and Mindanao) tell about the creation of the world: "An eagle flies between water and sky, finds no place to rest, the water rises to heaven. The sky becomes angry and creates islands. The eagle splits a bamboo, from which man and woman emerge

Man and woman, they beget many children and drive them away, as their number grew too large, with blows*).

All of this is little and not very characteristic; most striking is the tradition from Ceram, which resembles the biblical tale: A mountain, standing alone above the water, on which three people survived the flood. Also, a reporting bird, although active in a different way than in the Bible, appears. On the other hand, in the report of the Sea-Dayaks from Borneo, the flood is only secondary and on the Philippines, it appears completely blurred. Probably the material I have included here is very fragmentary and does not provide a full overview of the flood tales of the eastern island world.

In North and Central Asia, flood tales are missing; at least, I have found nothing about them, and only in the farthest East, where contact with the tradition-rich Northwest of America cannot be excluded, do we encounter the flood tale again sporadically.

19. "The Itelmens (Kamchatkans) also know of a deluge and a powerful flooding of the entire land, which occurred not long after Kutka (the creator) had disappeared from them, and many people would have been lost at that time, some would have wanted to save themselves in ravens, but the waves became too big: those who remained made large rafts, tied the trees together, and retired on them with their provisions and all their wealth; so that they would not drift into the sea, they prevented it with large stones, which they attached to ropes and let fall into the depths instead of anchors; after the water had subsided, they remained on their rafts on top of the high mountains*)." 20. In the Buddhist sphere, flood tales are unknown; they are not mentioned in Buddhist writings, and China and Japan are free from them***). What is considered "deluge reports" in China refers to quite natural local and historically known events, namely the floods of the Yellow River.

Above the capital of Henan, Kaifeng, the Yellow River enters the plain as a mighty river with weak gradient, which in late summer increases its water volume tenfold and carries a huge amount of washed-away material, especially from the Loess region, which gives it its yellow color. These sediments, which the river can no longer carry further due to the weak gradient, raise both its bed and its banks, so that the river flows higher than wide stretches of the surrounding plain. At times of particularly high

he gathers all the water monsters and invites them to pursue upstream along the river. Son-tinh tries to stop them by blocking the river with a steel mesh. Thuy-tinh, on his part, diverts the river and digs a new riverbed. Then he unleashes storms and whirlwinds, stirs up the rivers, which overflow their banks, and the army of water monsters spreads over the land, destroying villages and advancing to the foot of Mount Tan-Bien. The inhabitants of the high villages, frightened by the floods and the darkness which the sun cannot penetrate, build bamboo barriers in the pouring rain, while women and children beat drums to call for help. The monsters are defeated, yet their corpses form an obstacle in the plain that allows the waters to drain. One wins, this is a completely different circle of ideas than in other flood tales. (Dumoutier in Revue d'Ethnographie VIII, 159.)
Floods of the Yellow River. 37 High water then breaks through these banks and floods the neighboring landscapes, often causing terrible devastation. "The high floods of the Yellow River wash away hundreds and thousands of settlements and devastate millions of human lives. And what remains after the flood is an enormous field of corpses —." The river has had this character as far back as ancient Chinese tradition reaches, and one can understand why it has always been referred to as "China's Sorrow" or as the "Scourge of the Children of Han." In historical times, China has recorded no fewer than ten major course changes of the Yellow River, the first in 602 BC and the last two within living memory, in 1852 and 1887. During the last flood, two million (according to others, seven million) people perished*). Such flooding of the Yellow River is what the old Chinese accounts of floods, the "flood tales," refer to; they are specific historical events without any connection to the biblical tradition, certainly not "the same flood mentioned in sacred history," as Karl Gützlaff claims**).

38 Floods in China.

In the Shujing, the book of historical documents dating back to the third millennium BC*), it is reported that under the rule of Emperor Yao, a great and devastating flood covered China. According to Legge, Yao came to power in 2357 BC. As for the flood, the story is told very simply and without any mythical embellishment**). "The Emperor says: Prince of the four mountains, destructive in their overflowing are the waters of the flood. In their vast extent, they encompass the mountains and cover the higher elevations, threatening the heavens with their floods, so that the common people are discontented and grumble. Where is a capable man whom I could entrust with controlling this evil?" First, Nhwan was summoned, who fruitlessly struggled for nine years to combat the flood, until then Yu accomplished this by clearing the forests, regulating and damming the streams.

We see here a purely natural and local event narrated, which only stands out for its age.

Europe.

How the individual details of the Hebrew tradition settled on a genuine, originally existing flood legend material and created a mixture can be clearly demonstrated in the Greek flood tales, which in their oldest, hence original forms differ from the half-Semitic-Hebrew reports, but in the younger ones often come so close to them that the influence is unmistakable.

21. The ancient Greeks had two flood tales, that of Ogyges and Deucalion, which appear as natural events in the older writers but are adorned with suspicious details in the later ones. These flood tales have already been extensively examined and evaluated for their connection with the biblical report, so that it is only necessary to follow up on what is already available*).

*) D. Jöfler, The Flood Tales of Antiquity in Relation to the Biblical Flood Story. Yearbooks for German Theology, 1870, II, 337. — F. Lenormant,
40 Greek Flood Tales.

The two Greek legends first appear in the fifth century BC and are not found in Homer or Hesiod. Ogyges or Ogygos was king of Attica (or Boeotia), later king of gods and humans according to later traditions. The flood, originating from Lake Copais, extends only to Attica and destroys many, but not all humans, and the oldest legend knows nothing of Ogyges' rescue in a ship, so there can be no talk of connections with the Mosaic flood.

The most important Greek tradition related to the flood is that of the Thessalian Deucalion, son of Prometheus and father of the Hellenes. When Zeus destroyed the sinful human race with a great flood, Deucalion, according to Zeus' will, saved himself with his wife Pyrrha in a vessel that he had built on Prometheus' advice. They alone among humans were preserved, "the rest were swept away by the sea flood." After nine days, Deucalion landed on Mount Parnassus (or according to others, Mount Othrys, Athos, Etna) and sacrificed to the flood-protecting Zeus (Phryxios). The oracle of Themis in Delphi answered the two sacrificers' question about how to bear the loss of the submerged race:

Greek Flood Tales. 41

" Go away from the temple, cover your heads and untie your girdled clothes, and so cast behind you the bone of the great mother." 

Deucalion interpreted the bones of the great mother as the stones of the earth, and both now threw stones behind them with veiled heads. From the stones thrown by Deucalion, men emerged, from those thrown by Pyrrha, women (λίθος, stone; λαός, people). To commemorate the Deucalion flood, a commemoration festival with water offerings (Hydrophoria) was held annually in Athens on the 13th of the month Anthesterion, and offerings of honey and flour were presented to the existing earth fissure, into which the floodwaters had flowed.

The initially much simpler narrative of the Deucalion flood, which can be traced back to an inundation of the Greek regions by earthquake floods**, was later expanded through linkage with Near Eastern (half-Semitic-Hebrew) traditions, and so the taking along of animals and the sending out of birds were added. Plutarch reports that Deucalion used a released dove to scout whether there was storm (returning dove) or clear weather (absence of the dove)***) . This mixing is particularly evident

in the author of the treatise "On the Syrian Goddess" (attributed to Lucian, second century), where Deucalion bears the nickname Sisythes (that is, Xisuthros)*). Deucalion had "built an ark and his family, as well as pairs of various animals, entered the ark; all sailed in the one ark as long as the water lasted."

The Hellenes also had several other traditions of devastating floods, such as that of Dardanus, as well as entirely local, only island-specific floods, which can be passed over here**). In Phrygia, the flood tale is linked to the city of Apamea, whose nickname xipwvog (ark) was; it is attributed to Jewish and Christian influences of later periods (second and third centuries) when that city issued a coin with the ark, the dove with the olive branch, and the inscription NAE. The authenticity of the coin has been questioned.

The investigation of Greek flood tales has shown that the older their form, the simpler and more genuine they are, while the younger ones become more elaborate, with more embellishments and details being told, which do not deny their unmistakable derivation from the Hebrew account.

Flood Tale of the Edda. 43

Eastern elements were added to the originally authentic, and this is not surprising given the widespread presence of Jews, especially in the cities of Asia Minor and North Africa, from early on.

What else has been preserved in the traditions of European folk tales, which were recorded relatively late, in the Edda, among the Welsh, Lithuanians, and the Finnish-speaking Boguls, shows influence from the biblical report, even though there is always a national dress and perhaps an authentic, original foundation, which is not always easy to distinguish.

22. After the recent ebb tide, the sons of the god Bör (namely Odin, Wili, and We) killed the giant Ymir. When he fell, so much blood flowed from his wounds that the entire race of giants drowned, except for one who escaped with his kin; the giants call him Bergelmir. He fled with his wife on a boat (lúdr) and from him sprang the new race of giants. In the blood of the giant Ymir, where all but a pair of giants drowned, one can recognize the Flood, and in the boat, the Ark. However, the Eddic flood occurs before the creation of mankind; not a pious remnant is preserved in the boat, but rather a giant, an enemy of gods and humans. The epic features of landing on a mountain, sending out a dove, etc., are missing.* According to Bugges Borgang, perhaps here too we may assume Christian influences, translations of Viking experiences from Western Europe onto the ancient mythological basis of tales?

23. A Welsh folk tale tells: When the lake of Uion burst and flooded all of Britain, all humans drowned, except for Dmyvan and Dmyvach, who escaped in a boat and later repopulated the land. This ship is also called the Nevdd náv neivon and it had a male and female of every creature aboard,** which suggests Christian influence on the tale.

24. Among the Lithuanians, the flood story goes as follows: When Pramžimas, the highest god, looked down upon the world from a window in his heavenly house and saw nothing but war and injustice among humans, he sent two giants, Wandu and Wejaš, to the sinful earth, who ravaged everything for twenty nights and days; when he looked again while gathering heavenly nuts, Pramžimas threw a bowl down which landed on the peak of the highest mountain to which animals and some pairs of humans had fled. All climbed into the floating bowl, which now swam around on the flood covering everything. God then turned his face towards the earth for the third time and let the storm subside and the waters recede. The rescued humans spread out and only one pair remained in that region, from whom the Lithuanians descend. They were already old and mourned, so God sent them a rainbow as comfort, which advised them to jump over the bones of the earth nine times: nine pairs emerged, the ancestors of the nine Lithuanian tribes.* Clearly influenced by the biblical account.

25. A flood tale among the (Finnish) Voguls of Russia has been collected by Néguly; it goes as follows: After seven years of drought, the giantess said to the giant: It's raining heavily. How do we save ourselves? What do we do? The giant replied: Let's split a poplar tree and make boats from the halves; then let's weave a rope from willow roots that is 500 braza long; tie one end to the boat and the other to the ground. Each man takes his family and provisions for seven days into the boat, along with a pot of liquid butter. After making these preparations, they ran through the village and urged the other giants to do the same, for already the sound of the water could be heard. The earth was completely flooded, and those who hadn't built boats perished in the hot waters; also those whose ropes weren't long enough and who hadn't provided themselves with liquid butter for lubricating the ropes (when letting them out). The water began to fall on the seventh day, and the survivors could once again set foot on the earth; but alas! Wells, animals, fish, everything had perished; the people would have died of hunger if, at their request, the great god Numitarom hadn't created fish, animals, and plants.* I cannot discern any particular traits that point to borrowing in this Vogul flood tale.

46 Flood tale of the Moguls.

It is generally assumed to be firmly established that flood tales are lacking in Africa and that the descendants of Ham have not retained a memory of the "great universal flood," which should be characteristic of other peoples. The water-scarce north of Africa indeed is not suitable for local flood traditions that can be interpreted as memories of the great universal flood. Regular, periodic flooding, such as the Nile produces, is naturally not conducive to giving rise to such tales, since an event that can be confidently expected to recur regularly cannot serve to create flood tales. And just as the Nile annually has its flood, many other African rivers similarly, more or less, do. The swelling of these rivers and often associated major floods are caused by tropical rains, while in rivers fed by the Alpine glaciers of Abyssinia, snow melt still plays a role. The time of swelling is a regular occurrence with slight variations, from which conclusions about the climatic zone in which the source of the river lies can be drawn. If a tropical river has its high water in our summer, its sources cannot lie in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa. Thus, the White Nile reaches its highest level at Gondokoro (5° north latitude) in August and September. The gazelle river that flows into it does so in the same months; the Shari that flows into Lake Chad in September; the Binué, a tributary of the Niger, in September. On the other hand: the Ogowe (equatorial West Africa) in October and April, the Congo in December and January.*

However, not only within the riverbeds do the enhanced water floods appear due to periodic rains, but significant flooding of neighboring landscapes also occurs, as Livingstone's descriptions from the surroundings of Lake Moero and Lake Bangweolo prove, where such floods cover wide stretches of land and disrupt traffic for months. With the regularity of such phenomena, they naturally do not catch the attention of residents and remain in memory only if they exceed the ordinary.

26. Livingstone therefore found only "a kind of flood tale, and the only one that occurred to him in Africa." It concerns the formation of Lake Dilolo (Southwest Africa) and may be presented here for completeness.

"When we asked what Dilolo means, Schafatwala gave us the following report about the origin of the lake. A female chief, Moene Monenga, came to the village of Mofogos one evening, where a man lived nearby but had just gone hunting with his dog. She asked for food, and Mofogos' wife gave her enough to eat. After she came to another village and stood where there is now water, she made the same request, but not only was she refused, but when she threatened the villagers with their greed, she was mocked with the question: 'What could she do, even though they treated her like this?' To show what she could do, she began to sing in slow rhythm and named herself Monenga-woo. While she prolonged the last note, village, people, birds, and dogs sank into the depths, which are now called Dilolo. When Nafimakate, the chief of the village, returned home and saw what had happened, he threw himself into the lake, where he is supposed to still be. The name comes from ilolo, meaning despair, because this man lost all hope when he no longer found his family. Monenga was killed."

Here, a "flood tale" is not present; it is the tale of the formation of a lake, probably originated due to the similarity of its name to the word ilolo, meaning despair.

27. The Negroes on the Jezi River, west of Gondoforo, told missionary Morlang of a great universal flood, in which only one single man survived and reported this to his descendants.*

28. Among the Sudanese Negroes of northwest Africa, hardly any trace of flood tales can be recognized; older travelers who inquired about them confirm this, as neither the Ashanti nor their neighbors have tales about the Flood.* In the mission reports available to me, I have not found any indication of flood tales among the Bapedi Kaffirs about a great flood that almost wiped out all humans; nor among other Basuto—flame it is said that all humans were once swallowed up by a monster, except for two.*

29. Among the Nama, the missionary Moffat was told that the flood was remembered by the Hottentots, and one Hottentot explained to him that he had heard it from his ancestor and had never come into contact with a missionary. Yet Moffat was deceived, for later he met the missionary from whom that Hottentot had learned the tale.*

30. The Namahottentot tale also appears to have an obviously late touch, prompted by European seafarers who landed on their coast. In ancient times, so they tell, a "floating house" landed where Cape Town now stands. From this, several people with cattle and sheep disembarked and settled. The Namaqua descended from them.*

31. I do not find much more about the tale of the Bapedi Kaffirs of a great flood that almost wiped out all humans; nor among other Basuto—flame it is said that all humans were once swallowed up by a monster, except for two.*

32. According to the traditions of the Herero, their homeland, from which they come, is called Kaoko. Its location cannot be determined, but in this land, their few old tales have their origins; there stood the giant Omumborombonga tree, from which they originated, there is Mufuru, their primordial father, buried, and there was also a great flood that was so terrible that the Herero had to flee to the mountains and lost all their children except for a cow and a bull, from whom today's herds descend. This flood is said to have brought two white people at the same time, who lived long among the Herero in Kaoko and are the ancestors of the lighter-skinned Herero.

Missionary H. Brinker, who recorded this flood tale*, sees in it a memory of local historical events, perhaps of a great flood of the Kunéne, which, because of high dunes, cannot discharge its high waters directly into the sea but spreads widely along the shore. Occasionally, this mass of water must flood a large stretch of coastal land and turn it into an impenetrable swamp. At normal water levels of the Kunéne, its water either passes under the land into the sea or evaporates in the lagoons standing in front of the dunes.

Africa, according to what has been mentioned, is a barren ground for flood tales and can probably be excluded from the regions where such tales occur.

Australia and the Sweet Sea.

33. Among the Blacks in Western Australia from the Moore River to Shark Bay, there are traditions of great floods that are striking in a normally rainless land. The tales are "ancient" and one should not be surprised that one of the tribes mentioned is considered "white," as this is a newer addition, arising since the English penetration of the land. According to A. Oldfield, an excellent expert on the Australians, the tale runs as follows: "Long ago, two tribes lived on the banks of a large river, the Black tribe on the south side, the White tribe on the north side. They intermarried, held joint festivals, and fought (peacefully) with each other. The Whites were stronger, had better spears and boomerangs, so they were far superior to the Blacks. This made them proud, so they broke off relations with the Blacks. This situation lasted for years until one day it started to rain and poured for months, the river overflowed and forced the Blacks to retreat inland. Just as long as the flood rose, it took to recede. Now the Blacks returned to their old hunting grounds, yet how astonished they were to find a vast sea instead of the river, which had swallowed their proud neighbors, from whom they never heard anything again." Here, we can only assume a memory of a natural event; parallels to the biblical account are lacking.

34. The natives of Victoria (Australia) tell: Long, long ago, when our fathers lived, there was a great flood. All the land around stood under water and all the Blacks drowned, except for a man and two or three women who found refuge on a small mud island near Port Albert. All around was only water. Then the pelican came in a bark canoe, saw the poor people, and rescued them. The story now develops into a fable about the pelican, which has nothing further to do with the flood.* So here there is actually a flood tale with a miraculous rescue of the survivors. Thinking of any borrowing is futile due to the lack of characteristic, indicative details.

35. In the district of Rabadi in southeastern New Guinea, Chalmers heard the following flood report. Once upon a time, the earth was flooded; only the tips of the highest mountains remained free. Lohero and his younger brother were angry with the people and threw a human bone into a small stream. Soon, the great waters appeared, formed a sea, covered all lowland, and forced the people to flee to the mountains. The waters kept rising until the natives fled to the peaks, where they lived until the waters retreated. Some descended into the plain, others remained in the mountains and cultivated the fields.* Unambiguous.

36. On the New Hebrides island of Aneytum, there is a tale of a universal flood.*)

Certainly, I will find more flood tales among the Melanesians than those I have shared here. Their area of tradition is still little explored, but what has been shared is sufficient to show that Penormant's claim, that there are no flood tales among the Melanesians, except for the Fiji Islanders with Polynesian blood, is untenable.

58 Flood tale of the Fijian Islanders.

Certainly, I will find more flood tales among the Melanesians than those I have shared here. Their area of tradition is still little explored, but what has been shared is sufficient to show that Penormant's claim, that there are no flood tales among the Melanesians, except for the Fiji Islanders with Polynesian blood, is untenable.

Here is the translation of the provided German text to English, ignoring the strange formatting sequences:

37. The Fijian Islanders told of a flood which some considered general, while others believed it only covered parts of the earth. The cause of this flood was that the great-grandsons of the great god Nbengei killed his favorite bird Turutawa. Instead of begging for forgiveness because of their deed, they still insulted the god and fortified themselves with the help of their friends in the city where they lived. Although the enraged god took three months to gather his troops, he was still unable to subdue the rebels; he therefore dismissed his troops and ordered the rebels to be punished in another way. On his command, dark clouds gathered in the sky, from which an incessant rain poured down onto the earth. Towns, hills, and mountains were gradually flooded; but the rebels, who had entrenched themselves on the highest heights on the flood days of the Fijian islanders. 59 elevations, looked at the flood without fear. However, this rose higher and higher and reached their fortress so that they called upon a god in their distress, who advised them to build a raft from the fruits of the pumpkin; according to others, he sent two crows for their use, or, as the third account tells, he taught them to build a boat and save themselves in it. All voices agree that the highest mountains were flooded with water and the remaining people saved themselves in a vessel, which remained fastened on Mbengga as the waters subsided. Therefore, the Mbenganers regard themselves as the first in rank among the Fijian islanders. The number of those rescued was eight; however, two tribes of humans were completely wiped out in the flood: one consisted only of women and the other was distinguished by a kind of dog's tail*).

There are individual features missing here, which make this legend suspicious to us; it is therefore to be designated as original.

At least partially, this legend coincides with the report about the great flood, Maluvu levu, which a chief from Rewa, named Beindovi, reported to the American expedition under Wilkes. "After the islands had been populated by the first man and the first woman, a great rain came and the waters began to rise. Then two large double canoes appeared, one commanded by Rokona, the god of carpenters, the other by Rokola, his first master builder. They fished a number of people up and kept them on board until the flood subsided, then set them ashore on the islands again. According to one report, the number of those rescued consisted of only eight persons, who were landed on the island of Mbengga, whose inhabitants still claim to be descendants of those survivors." Beindovi told that in earlier times the Fijian islanders always kept two large canoes ready to save themselves when another flood should break in, a custom that has only recently ceased*).

38. On the Belau Islands (Palau, Palaos) of the western Carolines, there exist two somewhat differing genuine and original flood traditions. J. Rubary, the best expert on those islands, heard the tradition as follows:

Flood tale of the Pelau islanders. 61

In ancient times, before the present-day people lived, the inhabitants of the Pelau Islands were probably all Kalits (heroes), for they were strong and performed miracles and the Kalits walked around on earth like other people. One of these Kalits, named Atndolf, who was one of the Obafads (tree deity), came to Ngarefobufl in today's Eyrray and was killed by its inhabitants. Then the other six friendly gods went to look for him and came to the same village, whose inhabitants were known for being fierce. The gods were thus received unfriendly everywhere except for an old woman named Milatf, who took them into her house and also informed them of the death of Atndolf. Full of grief and anger, the gods decided to avenge him, but to repay the kindness of the old woman, they decided to save her and advised her to prepare a raft and tie it to a tree with a rope made of forest vines. At the time of the full moon, an enormous flood occurred, covering all of Pelau, but good Milatf drifted around on her raft until finally her rope became too short and she found her death in the flood. Her body drifted around and eventually got entangled with her hair in the bushes of Royofch Aremolunguy. When later the gods came to earth to visit Milatf,

they found her dead and regretted her fate so much that the oldest decided to bring her back to life. He did this by breathing his breath into her chest, although he also wanted to make her immortal and for this he needed an immortality water, which one of his companions had to fetch. But one of the gods, Tariit, whose image is in the Rallus pectoralis (a bird), was malicious and did not want people to be immortal, and so he persuaded the Kamaral tree (Hibiscus) to pierce the Taroblade, in which the water was brought, which the latter did using a dried branch. Through this, Milatf lost her immortality and the Kamaral received such a lasting life that even a small piece of it, once in the ground, grows and becomes a tree. The angry Obafad then punished Tariit; he still bears the trace of it today in the broad red line on his head. Since then, Tariit is regarded as the symbol of evil. Milatf now stayed in Aremolunguy and became the mother of today's people*).

The legend, as communicated by Semper**), is essentially the same, only the revival of the woman is different, and with her, the gods then begot the present-day people. The gods, writes Semper, came to earth where they were received unfriendly by the people. Only one single woman served them food and refreshed them. Now the Kalits told this woman at parting that she should make herself a bamboo raft by the next full moon and lie down on it in the night of the full moon. And now came with the full moon a terrible storm and rain and the sea rose higher and higher and flooded the islands, drowned the mountains, and destroyed the houses of the people; they could not save themselves and all perished in the rising flood. The kind-hearted woman, however, was washed far away with the raft until her hair hung in the branches of a tree on the peak of Mount Armlimui. Here she lay until the water subsided again. Now the Kalits came, searched for her, but found her dead. Then they called one of their women from heaven, this one entered the dead body and revived it again. With her, the Kalits then begot five children, then they returned to heaven and the heavenly woman left the body of the woman to return to her homeland. The five children repopulated the islands anew and the Palau islanders descend from them.
64 Flood tale on the Society Islands.

39. The unambiguous tradition that prevails on the Leeward Islands (that is, the western group of the Society Islands) is closely linked with the island of Raiatea. According to this, Ruahatu, the Neptune of the South Sea islanders, once rested between coral rocks in the depths of the ocean at a place that, because it was his residence, was considered sacred. A fisherman, who either did not know or disregarded this taboo, sailed with his canoe in the forbidden water and cast his fishing line between the corals. There the hook caught in the hair of the sleeping god below. As the fisherman now wanted to pull in his fishing line, he found resistance and had to pull for a long time until finally the line shot upwards, and soon after, the god, irritated and enraged by him, appeared on the surface. After he had reproached the fisherman for his offense, breaking the taboo, he declared that the land was now sinful and must be destroyed. Then the terrified fisherman fell at the feet of the sea god and begged for his forgiveness, while at the same time asking him not to carry out the announced evil or to let him escape. Ruahatu had a merciful insight and commanded the fisherman to hurry home to wife and child and to go with them to the small island of Toa-marama, which lies within the reefs off the windward side of Raiatea. Here

The man quickly carried out the command and went with wife, child, and a friend to the islet, taking with him the only domestic animals of the islands, dogs, pigs, and chickens. Before sunset, they reached the island and as the sun rose the next morning, the waters of the ocean began to rise, the natives on the shore left their huts and sought refuge in the mountains. But the water rose throughout the day and the following night, so that only the outermost peaks of the mountains protruded above the wide sea surface. But even over these, the waves eventually passed and all inhabitants drowned. When then the waters receded again, the fisherman and his companions left their refuge, settled on the mainland, and became the forefather of the present inhabitants. Toamarama, the refuge island, is a small, round coral island that rises at most two feet above the water, which is why it was not flooded during that great flood itself, the current natives cannot say when asked. The Farero, corals, and shells, which fossilized in the mountains, are proof of the former flood*).

only one person remains through whom then the continuation of our race occurs. Biblical influence, however, I can hardly recognize in the legends of the South Seas, although they were mostly recorded by missionaries.

Flood tales are by no means lacking among the Eskimos; they seem to me, as far as I can judge given the limited material available to me, to have arisen independently and to point to natural events that remained in memory. Hall(*) mentions such traditions from the Eskimos of the archipelago off the coast of North America; but they are also present among those on the mainland. Petitot heard them among the Tchiglit at the lower Mackenzie. "The water had spread over the earth ball, so that everything was in fear. The tents of the people disappeared, the wind carried them away. Several boats were tied side by side. The waves flooded the rock mountains, a great wind drove them over the earth. The people dried themselves in the sun. The world and the earth disappeared.

Flood tales of the Eskimos. 69

The people died from a terrible heat, they also perished in the floods. The people lamented, they trembled. The uprooted trees drifted as a play of the waves. The people, who trembled with cold, tied their boats together. Ah! under a tent, which they erected, they huddled together. Meanwhile, a man, who was called the son of the owl, threw his bow into the floods. Wind, stop blowing, he said, it is enough. Later, this man threw his earrings into the water. Then came the end" *).

44. The story of a flood, which Franz Boas heard from the central Eskimos of North America, makes the impression of a natural event and seems to be connected with the observation of disintegrations in high places.

Long ago, the sea suddenly began to rise until it covered the entire land. The water rose so high that it reached the peaks of the mountains and the ice flowed over them. When the flood receded, the ice stranded up there and formed the peaks of the mountains. Many shells, fish, seals, and walruses were left up there on dry land and their

shells can still be seen there today. A large number of Eskimos died at that time, but many others, who had fled into their kayaks at the beginning of the flood, were rescued *).

45. The Prince of Wales Peninsula on the American side of the Bering Strait is a volcanic area that is frequently hit by earthquakes. The Eskimos living there have the legend that in ancient times an earthquake accompanied by a strong flood swept over the land and that only a few people at that time managed to save themselves with their fur boats on the summits of the highest mountains **). The few traditions given here of the Eskimos, pointing to natural events, earthquake floods, are entirely unrelated to the biblical report.

2. North Americans.

The flood tales of the North American Indians were largely collected very late, and the later, the greater appears the danger among them of being influenced by Christian reports under the influence of the missionaries

Here is the translation of the provided German text into English, ignoring any strange formatting sequences:

Flood tales of the Algonquins. 71 has been noted to be fine. Around the originally existing true core of a flood tradition, biblical accessories crystallized, a mixture often took place, from which the truth can often only be separated with difficulty. That the biblical story was wrapped in an Indian costume is the rule, but it is often so transparent that after removing it, the next report from Genesis appears immediately, as this is easily recognizable in the flood tale of the Hundsrippen, whose entire creation story is also recounted according to the biblical one*). Therefore, when considering North American flood tales, the influence of Christian missionaries is very high and each report must be carefully examined. On the other hand, the generality of these tales provides a guarantee for their original occurrence.

46. The Algonquins had traditions about creation, the flood, and their early wanderings, which were written down in Indian picture writing. They were made known by C. G. Squier**) *) At Klemm, General Cultural History II, 155. The mixing of the original Indian tradition with biblical stories is taken care of just as well by the missionaries as by the Indians themselves, after the latter have been told the stories of the Bible.

after a manuscript from the estate of the eager collector Professor C. S. Rafinesque. The title of the manuscript Walum Olum means "Painted Sticks," because the original Indian inscription was carved and painted on bark; it comprises 184 combined mnemonic symbols with accompanying explanations in the original language and English translation. Rafinesque received the bark in Indiana in 1822 from the remnants of the Delawares on the White River; as Squier points out, he was a thoroughly uncritical man, but an enthusiastic collector of facts, and there is no doubt about the authenticity of what was shared, as the pictographs match the other Indians and similar traditions, such as those given here, still circulate among various Algonquin tribes. An intelligent Indian chief called in by Squier for verification confirmed the interpretation of the pictographs and the correctness of the English translation.

Regarding the "tradition" about creation, there is no moment of doubt that it flowed from Christian sources and can be traced back to missionaries, as already proven by the beginning: "In the beginning there were great waters over everything

land. And above the water were thick clouds and there was God, the Creator: the first being, eternal, omnipotent, invisible was God the Creator. He created great waters, great lands, and much air and sky, he created the sun, moon, stars" etc. Completely according to the course of the biblical creation report.

It is different with the flood tale, which appears originally and without echoes of the biblical story. Among all Algonquin tribes, the destruction of the world by a flood is attributed to a higher spirit, which is symbolized by a snake. It stands in contrast to Manabozho (Menabofchu), a powerful half-god. The picture script with Indian explanation and literal English translation is repeated by Squier on the attached table. According to this, the following description emerges:

1. "It was long ago, when the mighty snake (Mastanako) came, as the people had become evil. 2. The strong snake was the enemy of the creatures and they became confused and fought with each other. 3. Then they fought and destroyed each other and kept no peace. 4. And the small people (Mattapewi) fought with the guardian of the dead (Rihanlowit). 5. Then the strong snake decided to destroy all people and creatures immediately.
74 Flood tales of the Algonquins.

6. She brought the black snake and monsters and smoky waters. 7. The smoky waters spread over the mountains, everywhere, destroying everything. 8. On the turtle island (Tula) was Manabozho, the grandfather of people and creatures. 9. Born crawling, he can move and live on the turtle island. 10. People and creatures floated on the waters and searched everywhere for the turtle's back (Tulapin). 11. There were many sea monsters and they destroyed many (people). 12. Then a daughter of a spirit helped them into a boat and all together called: Come, help! 13. Manabozho, the grandfather of all creatures, people, and turtles. 14. All together, on the turtle there, the people there, were all together. 15. Very frightened, Manabozho asked the turtle to restore everything. 16. Then the waters subsided, it became dry on mountain and plain and the great evil went elsewhere on the cave path."

The relationships to the turtle in this tradition do not seem clear. It is known that the turtle played a role in the mythology of the upper Algonquins, so Charlevoix and Hennepin reported that according to the tradition of the Ojibibwà, the ancestral mother of humans, who poured out from heaven, fell onto the back of a turtle, where all the material gathered to form the earth. The large turtle was the main spirit of the Odschibwa, to whom advice was sought in important matters. The island Michilimakinaf, = large turtle, in Lake Huron, was the sanctuary of this spirit. The turtle flame of the Lenape, according to Hedenwelder, holds itself to be the most noble because of its descent from the large turtle, which represents Atlas carrying the earth in their mythology. The boat (Fig. 12) in the biblical creation story matches the most, appearing suddenly here and possibly inserted due to missionary influences.

47. Among the Odschibwas (also Algonquins) on the Upper Lake, Kohl heard similar flood stories, in which Manabofchu and the turtle also play a role, indeed an Indian pictograph drew something for him that generally resembles the images shared by Squier, representing the flood story*). The Odschibwa tradition of the flood is as follows. Manabofchu, a half-god, was friends with the wolves, and a small wolf, with whom he went hunting, was his particular favorite. This one he warned not to step on the ice of a lake in which the king of snakes lived, Manabofchu's

worst enemy. Curious, the small wolf went after some hunting on the ice of that lake, reached the middle, broke through here and drowned. Manabofchu waited in vain for his small friend wolf, he came and did not come. Then he lamented loudly for him and spent the rest of the winter in sadness. But he knew well who had killed his small brother: the king of snakes, whom he could do nothing to in winter. When spring arrived, Manabofchu went to the lake, where he discovered the footprints of the small wolf and now lamented loudly again. This was heard by the king of snakes, who emerged from the water with his horned head. "Now you shall pay for your misdeed," thought Manabofchu, and transformed himself into a log lying on the edge of the lake. The king of snakes and all snakes became wary over the log, which they had not seen on the shore before and sensed something behind; a twenty-ell-long snake wound its body around it and squeezed and pressed the log to see if there was anything living inside, but although all Manaboschu's limbs cracked, he held out and gave no sound. This calmed the snakes and they now lay down to sleep on the shore. Manaboschu then emerged from his log and shot the king of snakes and three of his sons.
Flood story of the Ódschibwás. 77

The remaining snakes, however, slipped sadly into the lake, making a terrible noise and scattering the contents of their medicine bags (magic pouches) along the shore and in the surrounding forest. Then the water began to swirl and swell in murky whirlpools. The sky covered itself with clouds and heavy streams of rain shot down from above. The whole surroundings, half the earth, were flooded; in the end, the whole wide world. Poor Manaboschu fled to deathly fright. He jumped from one mountain to another like a timid squirrel and could not settle anywhere. Because the swelling floods followed him everywhere. Finally, he discovered a very high mountain, to which he escaped. But even this mountain was soon flooded. On its highest peak stood a hundred-ell-high fir tree, and on this Manaboschu now climbed. He came to the last tip, the water always following him; it reached him already up to the waist, over the shoulders, up to the mouth. Then suddenly it stood still, either because the snakes had exhausted their magic remedies and helpers or because they thought it was enough and Manaboschu could no longer escape anywhere. Only Manaboschu, no matter how incredibly his situation may have been, held out and stood five days and nights on his fir, but in vain racked his brains about how he could help himself further.
78

Finally, on the sixth day, he saw a lone bird - it was a loon - swimming on the water. He called it to him and spoke to it: "Brother Loon, you skilled diver, do me the favor and dive once and see if you can find the earth, without which I cannot live, or whether it is completely submerged." The loon did this. He dived several times. But he could not dive deep enough and always returned empty-handed, bringing the sad news that the earth could not be found. Manabofchu was almost despairing. Then he saw on the following day the frozen body of a muskrat carried by the waves towards him. He breathed into it and by warming it with his breath, he brought it back to life. Then he said to it: "Little brother rat, we both cannot live without earth. Dive into the water and bring me some earth if you can, even if it is only three grains of sand, I can make something out of it. The obliging animal immediately dived and appeared after a long time. But it was dead and floated on the water. Manaboschu caught the body and discovered a few grains of sand in one paw. He took them, dried them in his hand in the sun and then blew them away over the water and wherever they fell, there they swam and
Flood story of the Odschibwas. 79 grew and increased either due to the inner strength of the earth or through Manaboschu's magic breath *). First small islands emerged, which quickly grew larger by joining together. Finally, Manaboschu could jump from his uncomfortable perch on the tree to one of the islands. He sailed around on it, like on a raft, partly letting other islands grow together and in the end, large countries emerged**). How Manaboschu then appeared as creator and organizer belongs elsewhere.

This flood story is clearly purely Indian and at most the sending out of animals, the diver, and the muskrat could be attributed to Christian influence, but this feature could equally well be genuine and original. In the recording that Squier gave us of the flood, which also arose from the conflict

*) Parallel to this creation of the earth runs an episode in the creation question of the Transylvanian Gypsies. God and the Devil sailed on the great water before the world existed. At God's command, the Devil repeatedly dives and finally brings the sand from which God creates the earth. (H. v. Wli3lodi, On the wandering Gypsy people, 254.) Identical among the northern Finns of Russia, where the great god, Tjham Pas, sends the devil diving in the sea, which existed alone at the time, and throws the sand that Tjham Pas retrieves onto the water, thus creating land.

Manaboschu had with the king of snakes, the sending out of the knowledgeable animals is missing.

48. In the legends of the Sac- and Fox-Indians (belonging to the group of Algonquins) about the creation of humans, underground gods fight against Wesukta, the main god of the overground gods. As they could do nothing against him, they turned to the powerful thunder god and begged him to send a great flood onto the earth so that Wesukta would no longer be able to torment them. All the clouds of the world came together, so that the sky was full and rain fell in wigwam-sized drops, covering the earth up to the highest mountains, to which Wesukta had fled. Now, as he saw that his refuge would also soon be flooded, he took a large piece of air and built a spacious canoe from it, in which he and his animals had plenty of room. Thus, he saved himself from the watery death. After floating on the water for several days, he let go of one of his largest fish and ordered it to dive into the depths to fetch some earth. This succeeded; it brought a sufficient mouthful, and Wesukta created from it the dry land that his red children still inhabit today *).

Flood story of the Xinnó. 81

Here we see two features already woven into the original Algonquin legend, the creation of a saving ship and the sending out of animals, which do not leave it entirely unaffected.

49. Northwest of the Algonquin tribes live the large group of Tinne Indians, which extends through British North America all the way to the Arctic Ocean, where they meet the Eskimos. They appear as Northern Indians, Chippewayans, Athabaskans in English literature; French Canadians call them Montagnais. Abbé Petitot, their best expert, introduced the name Dëne-Dindjié for them*); but the simple name Tinné has retained its validity. Among the numerous tribes of this group, flood tales are widespread, which differ individually from those of the previously discussed Algonquins. They were recorded by Petitot, but simultaneously equipped with comparative accessories, making it not entirely easy to extract the authentic content. Petitot wants to prove the Asian origin of the Indians, bringing them especially close to the Hebrews and drawing analogies from all corners of the old world for this purpose. Today's South Sea Islanders and the ancient Greeks, Babylonians, and Greeks, Jews, and Indians, all are welcome to him. The analogies

82 Flood tale of the Chippewayans. are there and mostly used correctly, yet they only prove the "folk idea"; while they lack any proof of a connection between the Dëne-Dindjié and the peoples of the old world.

Here is the translation of the provided German text into English:

50. The flood tale of the Montagnais or Chipewayans runs as follows: At the beginning of time, in the month of September, there was a great snow flood. Then the mouse gnawed through the leather sack which contained the heat, which now spread over the earth. In an instant, the entire snow mass melted so that even the highest fir trees were flooded, the water kept rising until it surpassed the peaks of the rock mountains. Only one person, an old man, had foreseen the flood and warned his companions in vain. “We will save ourselves on the mountains,” they said. But there they drowned. He, however, had built a large canoe with which he swam around, collecting all the animals that he met. Since he could not live long in this state, he gradually sent the beaver, the water snake, the muskrat, and the northern duck diving to search for land. Only the latter returned with some mud on its webbed feet. The old man threw the mud onto the surface of the water, which grew under the influence of his breath until all the animals could settle on it, and eventually he himself could land on it, the mud having grown into a large island.

Other Tinné, according to Petitot, say that the old man also sent out a crow, which, since it could feed on the floating corpses, did not return. Then he sent a turtle dove, which returned twice without result, but on the third flight brought back a green pine sprout.

The Dogrib and Slave Indians have the same flood story as the Montagnais.

51. Among the Hare Indians (northern Tinné), the surviving human is Kunyon, meaning the Wise. He builds a large raft because he foresees the flood from which he warns his friends in vain, who climb up trees and drown. The flood goes beyond the rock mountains; the "Wise" escapes it with the animals he has collected on his raft. Among the Hare Indians, however, the crow is the instigator of the flood, whom the "Wise" threw into the fire to punish him for his mischief. This was before the flood; after it, the crow was the first animal inhabitant of the raft to escape to earth, where he enclosed all the messengers to bring Kunyon to death by starvation. However, the small white owl discovered his wickedness, informed the "Wise," who freed the animals and repopulated the earth.

52. The Loucheux or Dindjió are the northernmost, Eskimo-bordering Tinne Indians. Their flood story agrees with those of their southern relatives except for individual details. Their Noah's canoe floated on the waters until these evaporated due to the heat. The high mountain where the canoe stranded is the Tschaneguta (Old Man's Place) in the rock mountains. Among the Loucheux (and Hare Indians) it is also said that the flood waters withdrew into a huge chasm in the earth. Some claim that the earth was repopulated by the transformation of animals into humans.

In the communicated flood stories of the Tinne, a multitude of genuine and original features are contained that guarantee their independent existence. The saving canoe, in which only an old man survives, can also be considered uninfluenced, and only the features of collecting various animals and sending out scouts may raise suspicion.

53. Quite peculiar is the tradition of the Cherokees, as it was reported in 1846 by Schoolcraft from an intelligent chief of the same, Stand Watie. Once, the water flowed over the land until everyone, except for a family, had drowned. That this disaster would break in, a dog had revealed to his master; he ran to the riverbank for days, stared into the water, and mournfully howled. When his master now urged him and ordered him to come home, he revealed the impending disaster to him. He concluded his announcement with the assurance that his master and his family would only escape drowning if they threw him, the dog, into the water. The master should build a boat and put everything he needed and wanted to save into it; for it would now start to rain heavily and a great flood would begin. To make it clear to his master that his dog had told the truth, he should only look at the neck of the latter, which was pale so that bone and flesh could be seen. As the master relied on the dog's announcement, he was saved with his family and could repopulate the earth.

Outside the announcement of the flood by a dog, which advises building a boat and putting everything necessary into it, no echo of the biblical report is found here.

54. Through greed, the first man aroused a mythical tribe of whites against himself; to punish him, these let the water rise so high that all land was flooded; then the first man instructed the ancestors of the Numangkate (Mandan) to build a wooden tower or a wooden fort on a height, and the water would only rise to that point. They followed and built the "ark" on the Heart River on a large scale, whereupon part of the nation was preserved in this building while the other part perished in the floods. To commemorate the good foresight of the first man, they erected a model of this building in each of their villages, which still exists today in Mih-Tutta Hangtusch and is called Mah-Mönih-Tuchä. The water then fell again and they still celebrate the Okippe festival in honor of this ark.

Catlin described this festival, and since it has some connections to the flood, we will convey what is relevant to it. Mih-nih-ro-ka-ha-fcha, the sinking of the waters, is the name of the flood according to him. The building (the ark, as Prince zu Wied says) is located in the middle of the village square; it consists of a wooden cylinder, similar to an upright orchestra, is about three meters high, and is called the "great canoe." "It is undoubtedly a symbolic representation of a part of their traditional history of the great flood, which they have somehow preserved and now seek to preserve in the memory of the whole nation. This canoe is, as the center of the village, the assembly place of the whole tribe, and they demonstrate their reverence to it during various festivals and religious practices. The religious ceremony of the Mandans begins when the willows are fully leafed; for according to their traditions, 'the branch that the bird brought home was a willow branch with complete leaves.' The bird mentioned here is a turtle dove (Varawit-Nschuka); it is a great medicine bird and must not be killed. At the beginning of the festival, a medicine man dressed as a white person comes to the village from outside; he represents Numant-Machana, the first man, tells the sad event of the flooding of the earth by the overflowing of the waters, and how he, as the only human being, was rescued by landing on a high mountain in the west in a large canoe, where he lives now. He has come to open the medicine hut, for which he needs a cutting tool from each hut owner to offer it to the water; if this is not done, a new flood will come and no one will be saved, for such tools were used to build the great canoe.

This flood story is, according to Catlin's view, characteristic of the Mandans; it is easy to recognize the ark, Mount Ararat, and the dove with the olive branch, so that here too the suspicion arises that Christian influences have worked.

55. Among the many legends that relate to the origin of the famous red pipestone of the Indians, the Knistino (Trees) also have a flood-related one. "At the time of the great flood, which took place many centuries ago and destroyed all creatures on earth, all the tribes of the red men gathered on the Côteau des Prairies (in Minnesota) to save themselves from the water. They made rafts out of cedar branches, as they still do today. The water kept rising and went over the tops of the trees, so that the Indians already thought they would have to cut their ropes; then the water began to fall. Some ravens that had broken free swam away, towards the west, and the descendants of the inhabitants live there and speak similarly to the Twanas, and that is why the Twanas are also so few in their old settlements. The mountain where the ravens were tied is called the 'Holder.' The Twanas also tell of a dove that flew out to examine the dead.

57. The Clallams, whose settlements are adjacent to those of the Twanas, remember a tradition of the flood, according to which some of them say it occurred not long ago, three or four generations ago. An old man reported to Reverend C e l l s that his grandfather had still seen the man who was rescued from the flood. However, the "Mount Ararat" of the Clallam is different from that of the Twanas.

58. The Lummi Indians on the northern border of the Washington Territory also told of a flood. According to the traditions of the Puhallop near Tacoma, once the entire land was flooded, except for a single high mountain near Steilacoom, which the Indians call the "old land." It lies in the Raskadengebirge, and an old man saved himself on a raft to it. There he stayed for some time and then sent out a crow to look for land, but it returned without results. Then he sent it out again, and this time it brought back a leaf from the still visible grove. At that moment, the old man was happy, for he knew that the water was receding.

Cells, who recognized the biblical account in the Indian traditions, adds the following remark to this perhaps Christian-originating tradition of the Puyallop: The Yakima also have their tradition, but according to the reports of their missionary Wilbur, it is impossible to distinguish what is original and what stems from the teachings of the missionaries. As often, both encountered and mixed here.

59. The flood tale of the Makah Indians at Cape Flattery (Washington Territory) relates to a specific local event (earthquake flood), which is narrated as follows: "A long time ago, but not too far in the past, the waters of the Pacific Ocean poured over the land, which is now occupied by the swamps and prairies between the village of Wäatfch and the Neah Bay, so that Cape Flattery became an island. The water suddenly retreated, so that the Neah Bay completely dried up. After four days, it reached its lowest level, and then rose again without waves and surf, until the cape was underwater and the entire land, except for the peaks of the mountains near Clayoquot. The water was very warm as it rose and reached the houses; those who had canoes saved their belongings and swam with the strong current heading north, some here, others there. When the water finally returned to its normal level, part of the tribe found itself beyond Nootka, where their descendants still live; these are the Makahs in Clallam or Kwenaitchehat. Many canoes got stuck in the trees and sank, and many people lost their lives. It took four days for the water to return to its normal level." Swan, who recorded this tradition, heard it told in the same way by the Kwilléyutes and Chemakum. He sees the cause as a volcanic subsidence and uplifting of the land. In any case, a relatively simple, natural event is quite precisely narrated here, which can be attributed more to an earthquake flood.

60. The legend of the Washo from near Lake Tahoe in California also points more to a volcanic, local event than to the flood. The local inhabitants were subjugated by a foreign tribe and made slaves. Then, sent by the Great Spirit, an enormous wave came from the sea over the land and drowned most of the people, so that only a few remained. The slaves now had to build a large temple in which their masters could take refuge in the event of a new flood. On top of the temple, they worshipped an eternal fire. When an earthquake occurred, the masters fled to the temple, while the poor slaves fled to the Humboldt River. The earth's movement was so severe that the flames reached the sky and melted the stars; the Sierra rose from the plain, and the temple sank into Lake Tahoe, leaving only the dome above water; on the dome, the inhabitants were saved; however, the Great Spirit was angry with them, seized them, and threw them like pebbles into the crevices of a large cave; there they can still be heard howling.

Clearly, this legend bears modern traits, such as the construction of a temple, which was originally foreign to the Californian Indians accustomed only to humble dwellings, while the volcanic formation of the lake and the sea breaking into the land could be old, authentic, local memories.

61. The Tolowa in California tell: Once there was a great rain; it lasted for a long time, and the water rose until all valleys were flooded, and the Indians, who were numerous at the time, fled to the heights. When the water continued to rise and flooded their shelters, they were swept away and drowned. But a couple fared better. They reached the highest mountain peak in the country and were saved. The couple lived on fish that they caught by stabbing them into their armpits, as there was no fire and none could be obtained, as everything was thoroughly wet. Finally, the water began to fall until it reached its previous level. All the present-day living Indians descend from the two remaining Indians.

62. Among the Maidu (northeast of Sacramento), the flood story runs as follows: In ancient times, the Indians lived peacefully and happily in the Sacramento Valley. Suddenly, a mighty flood arose so that the entire valley became like the sea.

no human can measure. The Indians fled, but many drowned and were eaten by salmon and frogs. Only two saved themselves on the mountains, these two, however, were made fertile by the "great man" and blessed so that they soon repopulated the world. From these two arose many tribes, indeed a large nation, and a man was chief of this nation — a world-famous chief. He went to a mountain from which one could see the wide water covering the fertile plains once inhabited by his ancestors. There he slept nine nights and thought about how the waters might be let flow again. He spent nine nights there, without food, and thought only: "How could this deep water cover the earth's surface?" And after nine nights, he was transformed. He was no longer as before, for no arrow with flint tip could wound him, even if ten thousand Indians had shot at him. He was like the great man in heaven, for no one could kill him anymore. Then he spoke to the great man and commanded him to let the waters flow from the plains his ancestors had inhabited. The great man did this; he ripped open the side of a mountain, and the waters flowed away into the sea*).

96 Flood stories of the Asochimi and Papagos.

Among the more recent tribes of California, the prairie fox or coyote, so frequently found there, plays an important role, noticeable also in the flood stories. It is not only, as with us, distinguished by loose tricks or like the jackal in the Orient; its role is more significant, already more so than in Japan, where the fox is also a mystical-mythical animal. The coyote appears almost as a creator of the world and benefactor of mankind.

63. The Asochimi (or Wappo) of California connect the coyote in the following way with their flood story. Long ago, all living beings, except the coyote, were drowned in a great water that covered all the land. He then began to repopulate the world in the following way. He collected a large number of tail feathers from owls, eagles, hawks, and traveled with these over the earth to find out everywhere the location of Indian villages. Where a big wigwam had stood before the flood, he stuck a feather in the ground and gathered dirt around it. After some time, the feathers sprouted, grew, got branches, and bloomed abundantly until they finally became men and women. Thus, the world was repopulated*).

Flood story of the Papagos.

97

64. East of the California Bay and south of the Rio Gila live the Papagos, whose myths also feature the prairie wolf or coyote playing a role close to that of a demi-god. He appears there as the minister of the god Montezuma and precedes the great flood, in which, after an age of peace, humans and animals perished. Only Montezuma and his friend, the coyote, escaped the flood; Montezuma had built a boat and kept it ready on the summit of Santa Rosia; the coyote had also prepared an ark from a large reed, sealing one end with resin. As the waters began to rise, the two saved themselves and met again on dry land after the waters receded. Montezuma was now curious to learn how much dry land was still left and sent the coyote on four different journeys in the four cardinal directions. In the west, south, and east, he found sea, but in the north, there was no water. Meanwhile, the great spirit repopulated the earth with humans and animals with Montezuma's help. The latter became ruler, but he led the rule poorly, despite warnings from the great spirit, who took the sun with him to the sky as punishment. Montezuma, always more defiant, then built a house that was supposed to reach up to the heavens, which had already grown very high when the great spirit sent his thunder and destroyed the high house. However, Montezuma's rebellious spirit was not yet subdued; so the great spirit resorted to his hardest punishment: he sent an insect to the unknown land in the east to fetch the Spaniards. They came, waged war, and destroyed Montezuma, at whose divinity no one believed anymore*).

The agile Montezuma living in the Gilathale should not be confused with the similarly named Mexican rulers. The name was brought to Arizona by the Spaniards or their Mexican entourage, where it shaped itself into a mythical figure among the native tribes and merged with local legends. Thus, the sending of the coyote to different points of the compass to search for solid land, as well as the high house erected by Montezuma that was supposed to reach the heavens and was destroyed by the great spirit, can be seen as influenced, just like the lowering of the Babylonian tower.

65. The completely independent flood story of the Zuñi in New Mexico goes as follows: The Zuñi once lived on the rich and beautiful mesa (the slope of the plateau), from which they were driven into the valley by a great flood, which, rising ever higher, reached the edge of the mesa so that it was necessary to appease the high element through an offering. A young man and a girl, son and daughter of two priests, were thrown into the water. One can still see them petrified, for two pillars, products of the growing activity of the water, are the two sacrificial victims*).

66. Among the Xlinkites (Koljufchen), the northwest Alaskan Indians bordering on the Eskimos, Felch, the raven, is the great creator around whom the entire mythology revolves. Benjaminov, who provided the first detailed reports about him and heard the name "El" spoken, associated him with Christ due to his birth without clothing, suspected early Christian influences on the traditions of the Xlinkites, which he also attributed to the two different flood stories still told today.

Krause heard the myths of Felch, the raven, from an old Xlinkite in the trading station Tschilkut. Felch had caught a large squid for his uncle, who wanted to kill him carelessly, and handed it over to him. The squid swelled and grew larger and larger until it filled the whole house. At the same time, the water rose, the flood surged in, and all humans perished. Felch, however, put on a bird bag and gave another to his mother, who also wore it; then both rose into the air. Felch flew so high that he touched the sky with his beak and hung there for ten days while the flood rose to his feet. When the water receded after this time, he let go to come down to earth*).

Besides this hint at the general flood, the Xlinkites have a legend according to which humans saved themselves in a large floating building. As the water receded, it stranded on an underwater rock and broke into two parts when the water returned to its former level. This is the origin of the diversity of languages; on one half remained the Xlinkites, on the other all the other peoples of the earth**).

67. In the mythology of the Bella-Coola (Bilchula) Indians, who inhabit the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 52° and 53° north latitude, the raven also plays an important role. As with the Xlinkites,

Flood story of the Bella-Coola. 101 he brought the sun to humans, which was locked up in a round ball by a great chief, Masmafalanich. This Masmafa- lanich is simultaneously the most powerful deity of the Bella-Coola. Once the sun appeared in the sky, he connected it with the earth with a long rope, which kept both at an appropriate distance from each other and prevented the earth from sinking into the ocean. But then he began to stretch and extend the rope, and consequently, the earth sank lower and lower, so that the waters covered all land up to the peaks of the mountains. A terrible storm raged over the earth at the same time, and many people who had taken refuge in their boats died, while others were carried far away. Finally, Masmafalanich shortened the rope again. The earth emerged from the floods and the people spread anew. The different tribes now had new settlements. Different languages also originated then, as earlier all tribes had spoken only one language.

Dr. Franz Boas, who wrote down this myth from the mouth of the Bella-Coola*), notes the deviation of the same from the flood stories of the Tlinitit, but rightly considers the account of the language confusion not suspicious, as similar features occur

among neighboring tribes: noteworthy is the perception that the earth is suspended in the ocean by a rope.

68. The most extensive flood stories in America can be found among the various cultured peoples of Mexico, where a Noah appears everywhere, who is saved from a great flood. Aztecs, Tlaxcaltecs, Zapotecs, Mixtecs, the inhabitants of Michoacán, and others have their Coxcor, Teocipactli, Tezpi, Nata, who with their wives were saved from the flood in rafts and continued the human lineage. As I now delve further into these Mexican flood stories, I note that I often rely on Hubert Howe Bancroft, who has grouped the extensive and often confusing material most clearly and cited the rich source material meticulously everywhere*). The most common and widespread of the Mexican flood stories is the following.

In Atonatiuh, i.e., the world age of water**), a great flood hit the entire earth, and all humans were turned into fish. Only a man

and a woman escaped by hiding in a hollowed-out cypress trunk (Whahuete). The man was called Corcor, his wife Kochiquekal. When the waters subsided somewhat, they landed their ship at the hill of Colhuacan. Here they multiplied and gathered their children around them, who were all born deaf. Then a dove came, gave them tongues, and bestowed numerous languages upon them. Only fifteen of Corcor's descendants, who later became family leaders, spoke the same language or could understand each other, and from these fifteen came the Toltecs, the Aztecs, and Acolhuaș.

69. In Michoacán, a tradition was preserved according to which the name of the rescued man was Tezpi. Not only did he save his wife like Corcor, but he was fortunate enough to rescue his wife, children, various animals, and provisions in a spacious ship. When the waters receded, he sent out a vulture to look at the earth and report whether dry land could be seen. However, the vulture settled on the corpses lying around and did not think of returning. Then Tezpi sent out other birds, including a hummingbird. As the sun began to shine and the earth turned green, the hummingbird returned with a green branch. Tezpi saw that his ship was at the mountain of Colhuacan

landed here. Clearly influenced by Christian influences.

70. The Mexicans in the vicinity of Cholula had a special legend in which the story of the origin of the population of Anahuac, from Chicomoztoc or the seven caves, is intertwined with the escape of one of the survivors from the great flood (Apachijuilitzli). According to Pedro de los Rios*), the land was inhabited by giants at the time of that catastrophe. Some of them perished, others were turned into fish, while seven giant brothers saved themselves by locking themselves in the caves of Mount Tlaloc. When the waters receded, one of the giants, Xelhua, known as the builder, went to Cholula and began to build an artificial mountain as a monument for Tlaloc, who protected them as the flood covered the land everywhere. As the artificial mountain threatened to rise to the clouds, the gods sent fire and destroyed many of the builders. Hence, the pyramid of Cholula stands only half completed today**).

The Mexican flood stories. 105

The story of Coxcoz, of the flood, of the Mexican Ararat Culhuacan, of the bird that gives speech to the mute, is based on the interpretation of various Aztec pictographs. None of the earliest writers dealing with Mexican mythology and who could learn about the flood stories through oral traditions at the time of conquest, such as Olmos, Sahagun, Motolinia, Mendieta, Ixtlilxochitl, and Camargo, deal with the flood stories. This naturally raises suspicion and suggests the question of whether the interpretation of those pictographs was correct? Indeed, Don José Fernando Ramírez, curator of the National Museum in Mexico City, has shown that the representations of the pictographs (by Clavigero, Humboldt, Kingsborough, etc.) are incorrect and were misinterpreted*).

because of its low value, but because it allows us to learn how legends arose under the hands of the first missionaries, who were delighted whenever they found biblical fragments among the traditions of the ancient Mexicans and wrote down biblical stories as native traditions from the mouths of their newly instructed converts, whom they had taught these stories, mixed with other details, from which it is difficult to say whether they were invented to fill gaps in the story or whether they truly originated from native traditions.* E. B. Tylor, Anahuac. London 1861, 276.

106 Mexican flood stories.

The first source for this misunderstanding was a map depicting the migrations of the Megicans, which Gemelli Carreri published in Churchill's Collection of voyages, Volume IV, from whose bilber-scription he read the Flood; Humboldt and others followed him. Ramirez showed that the dove, which was thought to have given numerous languages to the descendants of Cocor, is the well-known American bird Tihuitochan, which utters the cry "Tihui," meaning "let us go," with reference to the migration depicted in the bilber-scription, probably a migration of the Aztecs around the lakes.

However, even if these bilber-scriptions do not refer to flood times and were misinterpreted, we should not assume that such traditions were missing in old Mexico. It would be quite remarkable if such legends existed among all other Americans but were absent among the Mexicans! The existence of such traditions is supported by the famous Codex Chimalpopoca, in which the Mexican flood is narrated. It is written in Aztec language with Spanish letters by an anonymous native author and copied by Ixtlilxochitl.

When the age of Nahui-Atl came, 400 years had already passed; then 200 years, then 76, when people perished, were seized, and turned into fish. The sky approached the water; on one day everything perished, and the day Nahui-Xochitl or four flower consumed everything that was our flesh. And this year was Ce-Calli or a house, and on the first day of Nahui-Atl everything was lost. Even the mountains sank into the water, and the waters remained calm for 52 springs. However, towards the end of the year, Titlachan warned a certain Nata and his wife Rena, saying: Make no more wine (namely octli, pulque), but hollow out a large cypress and go inside when in the month Toçoztli the water nears the sky. Then they went in, and when Titlacahuan closed the door behind them, he told them: You must only eat one single maize ear and white beans. When they finished this, they wanted to go out because the waters were calm, and their wooden raft did not move. And when they tried to leave, they found fish. Then they made a fire by rubbing wood together and roasted fish. The gods Citallinicue and Citallatonac, who looked down, said: Oh, heavenly Lord, what is that fire down there, why does it disturb the sky? Then Titlacahuan sent Tecatlipoca down and began to get angry, asking: What is the fire here for? He took the fish, formed the buttocks, shaped the head, and thus they were transformed into dogs (Chichimec). The warning to Nata by Titlachan, the command to build a boat, the closing of the door by Titlachan, a door unknown in Mexican ships, certainly has suspicious, later elements incorporated into the original legend.

The Mixtecs (in Oaxaca) tell little about the flood, yet their tradition is worth noting for its numerical aspect: A monk of the previous century, Gregorio Garcia, found the traditions of the Mixtecs in a book from the Cuilapa monastery near Oaxaca, which originated from the monastery's bishop and was provided with Indian illustrations and their explanations. It reports about the gods and the creation of the world, the sky and earth being arranged for humans, but there is no mention of the creation of the latter. They suddenly appeared. Then later came a great flood in which many sons and daughters born to the gods perished. After the flood, humanity was restored again and populated the Mixtec kingdom.

Among the peoples of Central America, the Quiché in Guatemala claim special interest due to their relatively high culture at the time of conquest as well as the presence of ancient documents written in their language, including the flood story. This concerns the manuscript known under the name Popol Vuh (Book of the People), which was written shortly after the introduction of Christianity in Guatemala in the Quiché language by an unknown native, found at the beginning of the 18th century, and translated into Spanish by the Dominican Ximenez. According to the Popol Vuh, when the gods had created the animals, they were dissatisfied with them since they neither spoke nor worshipped. Therefore, they created humans from clay; however, these humans were also very imperfect, unable to turn their heads, speaking but understanding nothing. The gods then destroyed their imperfect work through a flood. Now followed a second creation of humans, where the man was made of wood and the woman of resin. These second humans were better than the first, yet still very animal-like in nature; they spoke, but in an incomprehensible way, and did not show gratitude to the gods. Then Hurakan, the heart of the sky, let burning resin rain down on the earth and caused an earthquake, through which almost all living humans, except a few, perished. The few survivors turned into forest birds. Finally, the gods created humans a third time from white and yellow corn, so perfect that the gods themselves were astonished; they took away some qualities from them and thus normal humans emerged, from whom the Quiché descended.

These myths do not seem influenced by Christian priests; a destruction of humanity by a flood, but not due to committed wrongdoings, as in the biblical account, is the only parallel that can be drawn, and this is insufficient, as otherwise the entire myth differs, indicating influence or borrowing from Christian sources. The threefold creation and threefold destruction of humanity is a genuine feature.

The religious views of the Nicaraguan Indians at the time of conquest are preserved through examinations conducted by Spanish clergy. In 1528, Friar Francisco de Bobadilla, on behalf of the governor of Nicaragua, Pedro Arias de Avila, conducted such an examination with the chief Mizeztoy, whose wording was preserved by Oviedo, and in which questions and answers concerning the flood are found. Bobadilla: Do you know or have you ever heard that the world was once destroyed again since its creation? — Indian: I have heard that our ancestors said it was once destroyed long ago by water. — B.: Were all humans drowned? — J.: I do not know; but the Teotes (gods) rebuilt the world and populated it with humans and animals. — B.: How did the Teotes escape? On a mountain or in a ship? — J.: They are gods, how could they drown? — B.: Were all animals and birds drowned? — J.: Those existing today were newly created by the Teotes, as well as humans and all things. — B.: Do all Indians know what you just told me? — J.: The temple priests and the Kazites know it.

This report is also significant because it shows how through the examinations of Christian priests, the biblical history was presented to the Indians. If the Indian simply answered "yes" to the posed questions out of laziness or to satisfy the priest, then a local flood myth was present that beautifully matched the biblical one.

The high plain of Santa Fé de Bogota in the state of Colombia has an elevation of 2500 to 2600 meters; it is surrounded by high mountains. The mostly flat ground, the entire geological formation, and the isolated rocks of Suva and Facatativa amidst the savannahs suggest that we are dealing with an old seabed here. The Rio Funza, which irrigates the plain, has carved itself a passage in the southwest and forms, falling into the valley of the Magdalena River, the waterfall of Tequendama. It lies before the town of Soacha, where its roar can already be heard. The river first falls between three rock ridges onto a low terrace, from where, dissolved into foam, it plunges into a deeper rock crevice, spraying up as a water mist. The height of the fall is 449 feet according to Gros and Acosta. The cross-valley broken through by the Rio Funza consists of limestone layers.

Now, these natural conditions serve as proof for the inhabitants of the old high plain of Cundinamarca of the correctness of one of their myths, in which the flood also plays a role. Already the conqueror Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada, when he first advanced into the land of the Muyscas (Chibchas), found it there and published it based on his manuscripts through Piedrahita. It goes like this:

In the earliest times, when the moon was not yet there, the high plain of Cundinamarca was closed, and the Tequendama pass was not yet open. The Muyscas lived as primitive savages without state and agriculture, when a bearded old man appeared among them, who bore three names: Botschika, Nemquetheba, Juhé. He taught them to cultivate the land, make clothes, worship the gods, and form states. His wife also had three names: Huythaca, Chia, Jubeayguya. She was beautiful but wicked and sought to destroy all her husband’s good undertakings. Indeed, she managed through her powerful magic to cause the Funza River, now the Rio Bogota, to swell excessively, flooding the entire high plain. Only a small part of the inhabitants could escape to the summits of the mountains. Now Botschika's anger flared up, and he banished the evil woman from the earth, turning her into the moon. To alleviate the disaster on earth, Botschika opened the rock wall and gave the water its outlet through the majestic Tequendama waterfall. The land dried up and was taken over for cultivation by the remaining people.

Here, we clearly have a primitive myth connected to the natural conditions, which does not correspond to the Mosaic account. It belongs to the class of flood myths dealing with sea breaches and associated floods.

The Peruvians had various flood myths. In one of them, it is reported that the entire earth surface was changed by a great flood, during which the sun was darkened for five days. All living beings were destroyed, except a shepherd with his family and herd. The shepherd had noticed some time before the flood that his llamas were very sad and observed the course of the stars throughout the night. Surprised by this, he asked the animals what it meant, upon which they directed his gaze to a group of six stars, which was a sign that the world would soon be destroyed by a flood; if he wanted to avoid destruction by water, he should flee with his family and herd to the top of the nearest mountain. So he did and climbed the mountain Ancasmarca, where a multitude of other animals had already gathered. As soon as he reached the top, the sea overflowed its banks and broke into the land with terrifying noise. As the water rose higher and higher, flooding plains and valleys, behold, the mountain rose with them and floated like a ship on the waves. This lasted five days, during which the sun was hidden, and the earth enveloped in darkness. On the fifth day, however, the water began to recede, the stars appeared, and the earth was repopulated by the descendants of the shepherd of Ancasmarca.

Here is the translation of the provided German text into English, with strange formatting sequences ignored:

77. Another Peruvian legend tells that two brothers escaped from a great flood in a similar manner by fleeing to a mountain that floated on the bow. When the waters receded, they were left alone in the world; they had consumed all their food and descended into the valleys to seek nourishment. Whether they found anything is not stated; when they returned to their hut on the mountain peak, they found there a meal prepared by an unknown hand. To learn where this came from, one brother hid behind the hut while the other descended again into the valley. The latter soon discovered two parakeets with female faces that came and prepared a meal of bread and meat; when these noticed the hidden brother, they tried to escape. The man caught an ara and it became his wife. From him he had three sons and three daughters, who were the ancestors of the Canaris, who still venerate the ara.

78. Among the Araucanians, the memory of a great flood has been preserved, from which only a few people saved themselves on a high, three-pronged mountain called Tehuel, the Noisy or Shining. This mountain floats on the water. The flood arose after a violent earthquake accompanied by volcanic eruptions. Whenever the Araucanians now feel a violent earthquake, they try to save themselves on a mountain to be safe from the flooding of the sea that can be feared after an earthquake. They provide themselves with provisions and wooden bowls, the latter to cover their heads because of the heat if the mountain on which they are located should be raised by the sea up to the sun.

The feature that the mountain on which the salvation of the surviving humans takes place floats on the water like a ship shows the kinship of the Peruvian and Araucanian legends, and in both it is clearly expressed how it concerns a sea flood that spread over the land from the coast as a result of volcanic eruptions, as the Araucanian legend proves.

79. Jaia, a rich and powerful cacique on the island of Haiti, killed his son who had offended him; according to custom, he buried the bones of the same in a large jar, in which they turned into fish. In the calabash, Jaia boasted, he had locked up the whole sea, and when one day his curious brothers looked into the jar in Jaia's absence, it fell to the ground and broke. Then an endless flood poured out, which flooded the entire earth, so that only the tips of the mountains emerged, which form today's Antilles.

The great jar in which the world sea is locked up, which is freed through a curious action and now causes the flood, is a truly Indian-Caribbean feature in the legends, which also recurs elsewhere, immediately on the mainland.

80. According to the legend of the Acawoio in British Guiana, the great invisible spirit Makonaima created a high wonderful tree whose branches bore various fruit species, from which the animals fed. He placed this tree under the supervision of his wise son Sigu, who decided to fell the tree to plant all the twigs and splinters of it, so that the entire earth would be covered with such fruitful trees. However, the remaining stump of the tree was hollow and filled with water in which the spawn of various fish species swam. But Sigu did not know that the water in the tree stump was connected to underground springs, which now began to flow powerfully. Therefore, he quickly plugged the opening with a wallamba, a closely woven mat, and the outflow of the water was prevented. Then the curious monkey Jwarrika, who kept treasures hidden under the mat and removed them, came. Then the held-back water flowed out again with full force and flooded the entire earth. Sigu fled with his herd to the highest places of the land, where he locked up the animals that could not climb in a cave, while he climbed a high palm with the others. There above, they sat day and night, freezing and hungry, until the waters receded, which Sigu recognized by throwing coconut nuts down from time to time, from whose sound upon falling he noticed that the water was gradually decreasing, and finally the falling kernels indicated that they had fallen back to earth. Then everyone descended, including the animals locked in the cave, which were released, the curious monkey was strengthened, and the earth turned green and bloomed again, the twigs and seeds of the wonder tree spread and covered the ground with fruit trees.

81. The Arawaks in British Guiana believe that since the creation of the world, it has been destroyed twice, once by fire and then by a flood. Each time as a consequence of human misdeeds, caused by Niomun Kondi, the great "Highlander." Those who believed in the warning about the coming fire saved themselves in a cave. Also, the chief Marerewana, distinguished by a compassionate heart and wisdom, who was informed about the coming flood, saved himself and his family in a boat. So that he would not be driven out to sea, far from his homeland, he prepared a long rope from vines with which he tied his boat to the trunk of a strong tree. When the waters receded, he found himself near his former residence.

82. The tradition of the neighboring Makusi reports that the great and good spirit Makunaima filled the earth with its trees and plants; he then climbed a high tree and chopped off pieces of bark from it with his battle axe, which he threw into a river and thus transformed into various animals. Only then did he create a man who fell into deep sleep and, when he woke up, found a woman standing beside him. The high spirit Epel gained dominance on earth and Makunaima sent great waters. Only a man escaped these in a boat, from which he let a rat go to see if the waters had fallen. It returned with an ear of corn. That single person who survived the great flood then threw stones behind him, which, becoming people, repopulated the earth anew.

It is not difficult to recognize, alongside ancient traditions (such as those found among the Acawoio on page 118), which form the basis, modern Christian influences in this tradition, such as the emergence of the woman after the man's deep sleep, the sending of the rat that returns with an ear of corn, while on the other hand, throwing stones behind oneself reminds one of the Deucalion flood, a feature that still recurs among other tribes along the upper Orinoco.

83. The Maipuri at the great waterfalls, the Tamanacos, and others told that at the time of the great waters their mothers turned into cranes to save themselves from the flood, which covered the earth up to the highest mountain peaks. If you ask those Indians how the human race survived the time of the great waters, they answer: All humans died in the waters, only a man and a woman saved themselves on Mount Tamanaku on the banks of the Asiveru (or Cuchiveru). After the waters receded, the survivors threw the stone kernels of the Moriche palm (Mauritia) behind them over their heads; men arose from the kernels thrown by the man, women from those thrown by the woman, and thus the earth was repopulated anew.

84. It seems that flood legends are found among most South American Indian tribes, especially in the Amazon River region and Brazil, but they have yet to be collected extensively. However, short hints exist and have already been noted shortly after discovery. Thus, Hans Staden from Homberg, who lived for ten months among the Tupinamba on the Brazilian coast as a prisoner in 1550, heard this:

In flames, so that no tree, no living being could escape the fire. Only a man was so cautious as to dig himself a cave, in which he stayed, well supplied with provisions, until the flames subsided. He alone escaped the general destruction. To know whether the fire was still strong, he occasionally stuck a long stick out of his cave. Twice he found it burned, but the third time it was cold. Then he waited four more days before venturing into daylight. It looked very desolate on earth, he found no shelter or food anywhere; then Sararuma appeared and said: "You may eat me," gave him a handful of grains to sow, and as if by magic, a splendid forest grew.

In a land where savanna fires devastate wide stretches of land with all life, such a natural event takes on the character of the earth-destroying flood and the parallel becomes evident. The saving ancestral cave replaces the ark, the thrice-stretched stick represents the sent dove. It is like a translation from one language into another, and yet I believe the legend is unadulterated.

The Distribution of Flood Legends.

Based on my compilation, which is aware of its gaps but still offers more than what has been collected so far, it can now be surveyed broadly where flood legends generally occur. It immediately becomes apparent that they are not universal.

In Southeast Asia, Persia, Tibet, Southeast and Central India, they appear. They are so scattered and rare on the great East Asian archipelago that I would almost exclude them here. Isolated like islands, the flood legend exists on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Following this, it appears that the same is missing in Arabia, Central Asia, all of North Asia, China, and Japan.

Europe actually has only the Greek flood legends represented in this field. The little that has otherwise been reported seems to have flowed from the biblical source, dressed in local attire or grafting onto a genuine existing material.

Africa, as has already been pointed out by others, can be excluded. There are indeed some flood legends pointing to natural and local events; however, this is so little and negligible compared to the entire large continent that it can be overlooked. If the extreme south shows more echoes, here Christian influence has been decisive.

From the Australian continent through New Guinea, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to the Sandwich Islands, we find the flood legends.

They are present everywhere in America, from the Eskimos in the north to the Araucanians in the south.

No Common Origin of Flood Legends.

The commonality of all flood legends and their derivation from a great event, the same as described in the Bible, is an assumption that still has widespread validity and finds its proponents even among learned circles. Lénormant, who stands on this point of view, says: The flood report is a universal tradition in all branches of humanity, except for the black race. No religious or cosmological myth presents this characteristic of universality. Therefore, these legends are the echo of a real, terrible event that struck the first humans and did not fade away among their descendants; it occurred near the cradle of mankind.

Aside from the fact that we still know nothing about the "cradle of mankind," as the vague expression goes, flood legends are not nearly as widely distributed over the earth and found among all peoples—as Lenormant believes. My compilation still reveals vast flood-free areas; alongside this, there are spatially limited legend areas of floods that can often be traced back to specific natural conditions.

Already Jacob Grimm had hit the right note when he said: "It seems to me impossible to trace the diversity of all compositions about the great flood and the creation of the human race back to the Mosaic document from which they should have become wild and estranged, the unique features, shortcomings, and deviations of each forbid this." Must this legend have arisen precisely among the Semites, and could the Hebrews not have adopted something from other peoples if we were to assume a prime source? The notion of the complete originality of the Jews in everything has long been refuted by comparative ethnology, and much that was attributed only to them or their lawgiver (circumcision, dietary laws, etc.) turns out to be a widely spread custom or older than among the Jews.

Comparative ethnography and the study of folklore have led us far enough today to show that legends and stories have their roots in the nature of the human mind. Their existence does not depend on a race; certain forms of them have indeed migrated from one people to another under favorable circumstances and have adopted local colors or mixed with existing myths there, so that it is the task of criticism to separate the original and the imported. That the geological diluvial period cannot be linked with the Mosaic flood narrative is now generally acknowledged, and indeed there cannot be talk of a flood covering the entire earth, but rather of local, partial floods. With the same right as the biblical report, the American Indian or the lake islander speaks of the flooding of the entire earth; it is simply the earth, as far as it falls within his field of vision, that is meant. Legends generally have the tendency to turn the small into the great, an event that was only local is inflated by it into a world event.

Translated from German to English:

Apart from the fact that flood legends are not as universal as is generally assumed, their inner content speaks against a common origin. In many cases, as we have seen, the obvious connection with the biblical document is so clear that the influence of Christian missionaries immediately comes to mind. Often it is the familiar story that has merely been given a local cloak, but more frequently it is the grafting of the same onto an authentic, existing flood tradition, which then must be freed from its biblical value to be recognized precisely. It is also often only the bare fact of a great flood that has been passed on, in which many people perished, while some saved themselves on mountain peaks or cautiously in rafts, which had previously been supplied with food. Such events are so natural and simple that one does not need to think of borrowing or assume an echo of the biblical report. And if one still wants to assume the latter, why are all the other equally valuable biblical stories missing, why has, for example, the creation story not been preserved and only the flood legend?

It is different with the embellishing details, and these, when they lean too much on the biblical report, often give us hints of borrowing and later Christian influences.
The Flood as a Punishment. 131 One has perhaps noted as characteristic for the biblical report about the flood and distinguished this alone, that the flood came as a divine punishment over the sinful human race and through it the destruction took place. But this feature can also be found elsewhere in thoroughly authentic flood legends and appears to me not to be striking.

In the material I have shared, a punishment through a devastating flood, originating from a higher being and decreed because of the sins of humans, is reported among the Kohls (9), the Mincopi (10), the Dayaks (17), the Fiji Islanders (37), the Palaun Islanders (38), on the Society Islands (39), among the Algonquin (46), and the Arawaks (81). However, only the legends under 9, 10, and 81 can be considered influenced by the Bible.

The dispatching of the dove from the ark and its return with an olive branch is already a more distinctive detail that must arouse suspicion when it occurs in flood legends of indigenous peoples. Especially among the Indians, various birds such as the crow and the muskrat take the place of the dove, in others the coyote (64). Always to be considered is that within the scope of seafaring peoples, taking birds on long sea voyages to determine the direction of the coast in uncertain situations was nothing unusual and could thus easily find its way into the legends. In ancient times, examples related to this can be found, such as the practice in the Indian Ocean mentioned for the seafarers of Taprobane*). The Argonauts sent doves flying to verify the possibility of passing through the Symplegades**). Floke Bilgedarson, who set out in 868 to discover Iceland, brought three ravens with him according to the Landnamabok***), which were supposed to serve as guides and from which it was assumed that they would fly towards land, so that the seafarer just needed to follow them. In the myths of North American peoples, animals dispatched during the flood play a role to explore land. On Menaboschus' command, the muskrat dives down to retrieve earth from the sunken land (47), from which the new world is then created again. And so on similarly among the Indians. The Peruvians, who fled into caves before the flood, received knowledge of the ebb and flow of the waters through the earth-covered paws of the dogs†).

A common origin of the flood legends. 133

In the legend of the Ré islanders (west of New Guinea), two brothers are raised into the clouds; they drill a hole through the sky to see what lies below. To find this out, they let a dog down on a rope, which they pull back up later; when they see that its feet are covered with sand, they knew where the earth was to which they climbed down*).

Sigu, the survivor of the Acawaio in British Guiana (80), throws nuts from time to time from the high palm tree on which he sits; from the sound when they hit the ground, he realizes how high the water still stands until finally the hitting palm nuts show him that they fall to the ground.

Among the Yuracarés, where the earth is destroyed by fire instead of water (88), the survivors occasionally stick a long rod out of their cave; if it is still burning, the fire still rages and only when it, on the third time, is unburned, do they dare to venture into daylight.

The feature in the Germanic flood (21) that humans arise through the throwing of stones recurs among the Guiana Indians (82, 83) and quite abruptly.

As a recurring feature, the forewarning of the flood by animals also appears. Among

*) Folk-Lore Journal VII, 22.
134 The Ararat.

the Tsihiroki (53), a dog is the warning, among the Peruvians, it is llamas (76).

Again, as a feature proving the commonality of the flood legends, the ship in which the survivors save themselves strands on a high mountain. Immediately, one recognizes the Ararat. As the rescue in a ship is a completely natural feature that does not prove borrowing, so is the ship's coming to rest on a mountain and that this must be a high, eye-catching one, naturally fitting the nature of the legend. Hence, the Ararat recurs so often. In India (4. Naubandhanam), the Tendong among the Lepcha (7), the island Wolaemi among the Mincopi (10), the Lulumut among the Binnas (14), the Nujaku on Ceram (15), the Parnas (according to others Othrys, Athos) among the Hellenes (21), Mbengge among the Zibsch Islanders (37), the island Taomarana among the Society Islanders (39), the Tjchaneguta of the Loucheur (52), the "Possessor" in the Olympic Range among the Klallam (57), the Cascade Range among the Puyallop (58), the Taylors Peak among the Mattoal (p. 93 footnote), the Pit of Colhuacan in Mexico (68), the Ancasmara in Peru (76), the Thegtheg among the Araufaner (78), the Tamanaku along the Orinoco, such parallels to the Ararat are found. However, only a smaller part (4. 7. 15. 37. 39. 78.) of these rescue mountains appear in falsified flood legends, a somewhat larger number is found in those that are interwoven with biblical elements.

There are other features recurring in flood legends among the most distant peoples that flow from entirely natural causes but cannot be taken as proof of borrowing. In many flood legends, the feature of the rescue ship being tethered with a rope recurs. It is absent in the Bible. If one considers such a single argument as strong enough to establish borrowing, there is a connection among the flood legends of the Indians (4), the Ramtschadalen (19), the Bogulen (25), the Palau Islanders (38), the Twana (56), and the Arawaks (81), among whom the tethering rope is significant. It is as natural as a dove dispatched on reconnaissance or the stranding of the rescue ship on a high mountain.

Certainly, it is also a heavy argument against the supposed universality of the flood legends and against a common origin of the latter that the neighboring peoples of the Hebrews were without knowledge of them. Among the Arabs, nothing is found that points to a flood legend, although they are Semites and the closest neighbors of the Babylonians and Hebrews. They deviate in mythological terms significantly from the northern Semites, and their pantheon,

136 No common origin of the flood legends.

before the rise of Mohammed, is a completely different one than that of the other Semites*).

The usually rain-living and anything but flood-prone Iran makes the transmission of the flood legend from the Middle Eastern region there unlikely. Nevertheless, several scholars claim to have found that the great flood catastrophe of Genesis can be found in the Avesta, an opinion to which Friedrich Spiegel does not agree**). In a narrative of the Bundehesh, a flood legend indeed appears, which, however, offers no analogy to the biblical report and was mentioned above (3).

The southwestern neighbors of the Hebrews, the Egyptians, also possess no flood legend. Their almost rainless land already indicates this. Lauth*** claims to have found an Egyptian flood legend; it is a hieroglyphic inscription "The new world order after the destruction of the sinful human race," which is located in a small chamber near the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I. (around 1350 BC) in Thebes and was published under this title by H. Brugsch*). This very legend of the destruction of humanity due to its sinfulness gives the text a special meaning, as it unconsciously reminds of the biblical tradition of the destruction of the sinful human race. Here and there the idea of a divine punishment that only spared the chosen ones from the general downfall. Otherwise, Egyptian tradition only moves within the narrow framework of mythological ideas, and there is no single further feature in it, apart from the mentioned agreements, that satisfies comparison with the biblical tradition**). Specifically, there is no mention of a water flood in it.

So the flood legend is not present among the nearest neighbors of the Hebrews and Babylonians.

Overview

of the original and borrowed or influenced flood legends.

In the short critical remarks that I have added to the individual flood legends, I have always highlighted where it concerns original and genuine legendary material, where the same is borrowed or mixed with the Chaldean-Hebrew report. The influence of the latter has been enormous, and it has become even stronger where it could rely on something originally present. This shows itself especially in America. In this vast area, we may assume the presence of genuine and original flood legends; yet these have only partially remained pure, others show the original forms only fragmentarily, and in many cases, there is a mixture with elements of the Middle Eastern legend, which here and there completely

Original and borrowed flood legends. 139 takes the foreground, only adorned with a native cloak. It is a long journey that the Middle Eastern legend has traveled through millennia, generations, and peoples, where it constantly rejuvenates with tenacious life force, a journey that can hardly be traced again with such precision in a human spiritual product. Four thousand years lie between the clay tablet inscriptions once preserved in Sardanapalus' palace library and the stories influenced by them, which still resound in the wigwam of the Indian today.

Now considering the above-mentioned flood legends from the perspective of Chaldean-Hebrew influence, they can be divided into genuine and influenced. The latter has occurred to varying degrees; often only a few features of the Middle Eastern report have been incorporated into the originally present, genuine native tradition, sometimes these increase and the native source dwindles, so that eventually sometimes only the biblical legend in foreign garb appears before us, and it is difficult to decide whether there was ever an originally genuine version of the flood legends at all.

As original and genuine, the following flood legends appear to me:

The natural causes of the flood legends.

The causes of large floods that devastate wide stretches of land are of many kinds, yet rain plays a subordinate role, as it never exceeds a certain measure and, following the slope of the valleys, flows away more or less quickly; similarly, the often powerful floods of devastating rivers subside after a short time and remain mostly spatially limited. These natural phenomena are small compared to the mighty floods caused by hurricanes or even more so by earthquakes, for which we add compilations by Eduard Suess*).

The wave caused by the earthquake in Lisbon in 1755 crossed the entire Atlantic Ocean as far as the Antilles. The earthquake in Simoda, Japan, in 1854 manifested itself as raised waves along the coast of California*). The face of the Earth I, 27ff.

The provided text appears to contain only the word "andfather." followed by a series of dots formatted in a column. Since there is no actual German text provided beyond "andfather," which does not appear to be a German word, the translation to English would simply be:

andfather.

If "andfather" is intended to be a German term or a play on words, more context would be needed for an accurate translation. As it stands, it remains as is in the English translation.

Noticeable. The tsunami generated by the earthquake in Arica, Peru on August 13, 1868, reached the Pacific Ocean with powerful waves on August 14 at the Sandwich Islands and on August 15 along the coasts of New Zealand and Australia, as shown on the map by F. v. Hochfetter. Due to the earthquake, the entire water mass along the shaken coastal region, from the deepest depths to the surface, was agitated; it was displaced from its equilibrium and entered into a swinging motion that was transmitted to the Pacific Ocean and lasted about 60 hours. Like a stone thrown into the calm water surface of a lake creates waves that spread out in concentric rings from the center of disturbance to all directions towards the shore, so the earth's forces near Arica gave rise to the formation of concentric wave circles that extended south, north, and westward to Australia and Japan, covering the entire large area of almost a third of the Earth's surface of the Pacific Ocean and exerting devastating effects even at the most distant shores. For example, the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, which is 6000 nautical miles away from Arica, was hit between 3 and 4 AM on August 15, and the harbor bay of Lyttelton was completely exposed due to the retreat of the sea. Soon after, the sea returned with a terrifying noise and formed a foaming wall three meters high, flooding the shore up to a meter above the highest spring tide mark. This happened three more times. Here we are dealing with enormous distances in which the tsunamis caused by earthquakes still had an effect. Very different and much stronger, when a land area near the impact is hit by such a wave, as was the case with the city of Callao in Peru, destroyed by an earthquake on October 28, 1746. Just as the inhabitants had recovered from the first shock, the sea began to swell suddenly and to an astounding degree, rising with such great pressure that the water, falling from the height it had reached, rushed forward furiously and covered everything with a tremendous flood far beyond its banks, smashing most of the ships anchored in the harbor, lifting the remaining ones over the height of the walls and towers, driving them forward, and leaving them stranded far beyond the city. At the same time, the flood carried everything away from its base that it covered with houses and buildings. Of the 5000 inhabitants, approximately 200 survived this hour.

The earthquake-generated tsunamis are those that cause the greatest destructive floods, through the agitated sea that devastates flat coastal areas and islands. That they are clearly preserved in the traditions of the affected peoples and work mythopoetically can be seen from several of the collected flood legends mentioned above. It is precisely the American continent's western coast, rich in earthquake-generated tsunamis, where I can prove this. They begin in the north with the legend of the Estimo of the Prince Wales Peninsula (45), are clearly recognizable in the traditions of the Makah and Wasgo (59. 60), recur in Peru (76), and end in the south among the Arauaners (78).

If we encounter flood legends in the interior of a country, in high mountainous regions, then we must examine the underlying causes or whether they have migrated there. Indeed, a local event, such as a river flood occurring under certain circumstances, can give rise to flood traditions, while regularly recurring floods expected at certain times of the year do not provide a reason for a tradition to form. The periodic Nile flood or the massive swelling of the African rivers has not given rise to any flood legends. The breakthrough of the Rio Junza on the high plateau of Santa Fé de Bogota, which remained in memory, or the natural conditions attributed by the natives,

Breakthroughs of rivers and lakes. 147 worked mythopoetically and gave an authentic flood legend existence (75). The flood legends circulating in Tibet and Kashmir (6. 8) also point to the breakthroughs of lakes, as does the Welsh one (23). All of Hungary, according to a legend, was once covered by a vast freshwater lake, which only later found its outlet through the iron gate. Geologists do not deny the possibility of such an event, and therefore the legend of the former flooding of the land can be connected here. How such breakthroughs work can be demonstrated by an example from recent times, although in this case, it was not the rock barrier but only the blocking ice that was removed. The Shyok is one of the source streams of the Indus, which originates in a "true sea of glaciers." Terraces and strandlines around show that lakes repeatedly formed at the source, seeking their way out through a very narrow gorge. This last happened in 1841, when the ice barrier blocking the lake was breached in June, and the water rushed down into the Shyok valley with destructive force, causing terrible devastation in this valley and then further along the Indus. Houses and trees, men and women, sheep and goats were swept away. According to the testimony of the inhabitants of Chalung and Tartuf, the flood waves passed by their villages at two o'clock in the afternoon. Since these villages stand opposite each other on the river and are ten English miles apart, the agreement of the testimonies can be considered proof of its accuracy. Two days later, the flood passed by the 550 English miles distant Torbela, from which the speed of the flooding was calculated at 16.8 English feet per second. Even in 1847, the devastating effects of the flood could still be clearly traced. At Tertse, at one of the widest points of the valley, water lines could be seen at 20 feet high; half a mile away from the river, the washed-away timber piles were still lying, and no tree stood in the valley itself. According to eyewitness reports, thunder-like, dull rumbling announced the approach of the flood, which "like a wall of mud" shot forth with lightning speed. "It was a horrifying mixture of muddy water, dead soldiers, farmers, war horses, camels, naked women, tents, donkeys, oxen, trees, and household goods; briefly, everything that was there went mixed together in a single flood. Because Rajah Golab Singh's army was encamped in the riverbed. About 500 of these troops were immediately swept away."

Further included here are the described floods of the Yellow River in China (20), the formation of the Tempe Valley through an earthquake caused by Poseidon, through which the waters covering Thessaly received their outlet, etc.

Further motivation for legends that the sea once flooded the land up to the highest mountain peaks and destroyed everything there came from fossilizations that were not lost on the eyes of the indigenous people either. In Samoa, it was generally believed that where land now rises, fish swam before; as the waters receded, many fish were left behind and turned to stone. Franz Boas found the same view among the Central Eskimos (44), as old Cranz reported about the Greenlanders. The flood legend of the Society Islanders (39) also refers to the fossils, the fossilized corals and shells on the high mountains, which could only have gotten there during the great flood.

The same evidence for a once land-covering flood as today's indigenous people provided, but also the peoples of classical antiquity did, as evidenced by the testimonies gathered by E.B. Tylor, whom I follow here. Herodotus observed the fossils of Egypt. Eratosthenes asks where it comes from that thousands of stadia away from the sea, numerous shell remains can be seen in many places in the inland, such as at the temple of Jupiter Ammon? The Lydian Xanthus also saw fish-like stones and mussel shells far from the sea, all evidence of the former presence of the sea where today there is mainland. Pomponius Mela, speaking of Numidia, reports that there - hardly believable - it is said that fish bones, Murex, and oyster shells appear on dry ground and the stone shows the washing-out effects of sea waves. And Ovid sings:

I saw countries arisen from waves,
Far away lay from the sea, native mussels.

Tertullian connects the fossilizations of the mountains with the reappearance of the land that once sank under the water.

Still, the cyclones or whirlwind storms with their high water surges and devastating effects, as they occur particularly in East and West India, should be considered as causes of floods that remain in memory and give rise to flood legends. Instead of many, I will briefly cite an example that is well suited to show how a flood legend can be shaped, especially if such an event strikes a sparsely populated land from which only a few people managed to escape. These could then easily believe themselves to be the sole survivors, who now repopulate "the earth," viewing the local event as a general one and passing on the tradition to future generations.

The Indian cyclone on November 1, 1864, which raged along the entire eastern coast of the Coromandel region like a harbinger of death, claimed no less than 60,000 lives, mostly due to the sudden surge of the spring tide. It was worst in Mahulipatam, which lies slightly north of the mouth of the Krishna, on the plain stretching from here to the Godavari, protected from the sea by dams and dikes. For the whirlwind hurricane, these were an easy prey when, sweeping across the Bay of Bengal, it broke over the dikes at night around 10 o'clock. A tidal wave, reaching 13 feet above the previous highest tide, surged over the dikes and buried the entire land with its water deluge. For an hour, the floods flew and covered nearly 1100 square English miles. When they withdrew around 11 o'clock, the work of destruction was done; but they had penetrated 17 English miles into the interior, washing away all the low huts of the natives, capturing humans and cattle, and burying the harvest under sand and mud. Half of the city of Masulipatam lay in ruins, large stone blocks had been hurled 60 and 70 ells away, and a third of the population, 16,000, had perished. In the surrounding towns, 20,000 deaths were counted. And the flood had only lasted a short hour.

Earthquake-generated tsunamis with their devastating effects, local events such as the observed breakthroughs of rivers, the observation of marine animal fossilizations found on the mainland, whirlwind storms accompanied by floods, these are thus causes that could and have given rise to flood legends, as long as they are not of totemic nature. The wide distribution of such effective causes over the earth already allows the conclusion that the traditions of floods do not refer to a single event but that flood legends naturally arose among many peoples.
