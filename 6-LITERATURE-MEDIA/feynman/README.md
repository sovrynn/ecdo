Feynman technique.

## GPT

The **Feynman Technique** is a learning and problem-solving method that helps deepen understanding by explaining concepts in simple terms. Here’s how it works:

1. **Choose a Concept to Learn**  
   Pick a topic or concept you want to understand better.

2. **Teach It to a “Beginner”**  
   Write down an explanation as if you’re teaching it to someone new to the topic. Aim for clarity and simplicity, avoiding jargon. This helps clarify your understanding and reveals any weak spots.

3. **Identify Gaps and Go Back to the Source**  
   As you explain, you’ll likely encounter areas where your understanding is shaky. When this happens, revisit the material, notes, or research to fill in these gaps.

4. **Simplify and Use Analogies**  
   Refine your explanation by simplifying further and adding analogies where possible. The goal is to make it so clear that even a young child could grasp the concept.

The Feynman Technique emphasizes active learning, requiring you to engage with the material and reinforce your understanding through simple language.
