 All is consciousness. I have found that nightly exercise of the third eye results in better control during AP. Last night I went to sleep at 9pm. Woke myself at 12am, and meditated on my third eye for 2 hours not trying to project but simply sending energy there. I spent the first 30 minutes “knowing” each portion and each organ of my body and thanking it. Then moved to my head and mentally massaged my eyes and then my pineal gland. Then I breathed into the pineal gland sending white gold energy from my sacrum up through my body into my pineal gland with each in-breath allowing the energy to recycle back to my sacrum with each out breath. The last hour was a powerful AP that came effortlessly and allowed me to inspect the Engine of Time. A series of stacked gears made of pink-purple translucent fluid in which all of time interacts with itself in many dimensions (some looping back). The gears were not all turning in the same direction and there were some gears that floated outside but near the Engine.

Interestingly the Engine was inside a white room. That room was outside the infinity of time, but was an architectural infinity unto itself.

After the spiritual experience I returned to my body, removed my eye cover and opened my eyes. I allowed myself to process the vision. I felt like there was more. I replaced the eye cover and breathed into my pineal gland again to thank it for the work. It felt a little sore. I mentally massaged it again and sent it the sound of a crowd cheering. Immediately I projected again into a room full of people having sex. I was one of the people. I felt a huge amount of energy being directed from my pineal gland into my sacrum. The tingling warm glow flowed down my core and energized my sacrum so much that I was immediately overcome with lust and desire for sex.
