What Gamma waves do:
	Heightened Perception: Gamma waves are believed to play a role in binding information from different parts of the brain, creating a unified picture of the world around you. This can lead to sharper senses and a more detailed understanding of your environment.
    Learning and Memory: Gamma waves are thought to be involved in consolidating short-term memories into long-term ones. They may also be important for processing new information and integrating it with existing knowledge.
    Cognitive Functioning: Gamma waves are associated with a variety of higher-order cognitive functions, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity. When your brain is generating a lot of gamma waves, you’re likely in a state of peak mental performance.
	Gamma and Focused Attention: Gamma waves are often linked to focused attention. When you’re deeply concentrated on a task, your brain may produce more gamma waves in the relevant areas.
    
    
    How to Change: Engage in tasks that require intense focus or enjoy activities that challenge your brain, like complex problem-solving or learning a new language.
    Why: Gamma waves are associated with high-level information processing, insight, and cognitive functioning.
    When: Optimize Gamma waves when you need to process information rapidly, such as studying for an exam or working on a complex project.
    
    Focus and Perception

Gamma waves make the brain feel “alive”. In this state, the brain is able to grasp information very fast, and in an accurate manner.  Gamma waves sort of “activate” the processing capacity of the brain. When the brain is in the gamma wave state, it processes information very quickly and stores it for future use.
IQ and Memory Binding

Gamma waves move from the front to the back of the brain at a relatively fast speed. This is why neural connections within and between the hemispheres of the brain become stronger when gamma waves are produced. In such a state, all senses (visual, auditory and olfactory) become much heightened. These sensory connections are also linked to the brain, connecting information from many parts of the brain. As this goes on, the brain is actively storing and retrieving information.

This information is then packed as memories in a process known as memory binding. That’s why individuals with high amount of gamma waves are considered to be exceptionally intelligent. They also have a relatively high Intelligent Quotient (IQ) compared to others.
