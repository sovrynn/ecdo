AUTHOR'S NOTE
•
The prime source for the biblical verses quoted in The Twelfth Planet is
the Old Testament in its original Hebrew text. It must be borne in mind that
all the translations consulted—of which the principal ones are listed at the
end of the book—are just that: translations or interpretations. In the final
analysis, what counts is what the original Hebrew says.
In the final version quoted in The Twelfth Planet, I have compared the
available translations against each other and against the Hebrew source and
the parallel Sumerian and Akkadian texts/tales, to come up with what I
believe is the most accurate rendering.
The rendering of Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite texts has
engaged a legion of scholars for more than a century. Decipherment of script
and language was followed by transcribing, transliterating, and finally,
translating. In many instances, it was possible to choose between differing
translations or interpretations only by verifying the much earlier
transcriptions and transliterations. In other instances, a late insight by a
contemporary scholar could throw new light on an early translation.
The list of sources for Near Eastern texts, given at the end of this book,
thus ranges from the oldest to the newest, and is followed by the scholarly
publications in which valuable contributions to the understanding of the texts
were found.
