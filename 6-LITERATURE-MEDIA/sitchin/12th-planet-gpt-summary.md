# Prologue (verbatim)

Prologue: GENESIS • At a time when our own astronauts have landed on the Moon and our unmanned spacecraft explore other planets, it is no longer impossible to believe that a civilization on another planet more advanced than ours was capable of landing its astronauts on the planet Earth at some time in the past. Indeed, a number of popular writers have speculated that ancient artifacts such as the pyramids and giant stone sculptures must have been fashioned by advanced visitors from another planet.

There is, however, little novelty in such intriguing speculation. Even the ancient peoples themselves believed that superior beings "from the heavens"—the ancient gods—came down to Earth. What no popular writer on the subject provides is answers. If, indeed, such beings did come to Earth, when did they come, how did they come, from where did they come, and what did they do here during their stay?

What we propose to do is to provide answers to these questions. Using the Old Testament as our anchor, and submitting as evidence nothing but the texts, drawings, and artifacts left us by the ancient peoples of the Near East, we will go beyond the intriguing questions and the provocative suggestions. We will prove that Earth was indeed visited in its past by astronauts from another planet.

We will identify the planet from which these astronauts came.

We will decipher a sophisticated ancient cosmology that explains better than our present sciences how Earth and other parts of the solar system came into being.

We will lay bare ancient reports of a celestial collision, as a result of which an intruding planet was captured into the Sun's orbit, and show that all the ancient religions were based on the knowledge and veneration of this twelfth member of our solar system.

We will prove that this Twelfth Planet was the home planet of the ancient visitors to Earth. We will submit texts and celestial maps dealing with the space flights to Earth, and will establish when and why they came to Earth.

We will describe them, and show how they looked and dressed and ate, glimpse their craft and weapons, follow their activities upon Earth, their loves and jealousies, achievements and struggles. We will unravel the secret of their "immortality."

We will trace the dramatic events that led to the "Creation" of Man, and show the advanced methods by which this was accomplished. We will then follow the tangled relationship of Man and his deities, and throw light on the true meaning of the events passed to us in the tales of the Garden of Eden, the Tower of Babel, the Deluge, the rise of civilization, the three branches of Mankind. We will show how Man—endowed by his makers biologically and materially—ended up crowding his gods off Earth.

We will show that Man is not alone and that future generations will have yet another encounter with the bearers of the Kingship of Heaven.

# Summary of Chapter 1: **The Endless Beginning**

This chapter explores the mysteries surrounding the origins of modern human civilization, challenging conventional evolutionary timelines and proposing intriguing questions about humanity’s rapid development and its connection to the Near East.

  - Life on Earth, traced back billions of years, raises questions about its singular origin.
  - Man’s evolutionary timeline, from primitive apes to Homo sapiens, shows sudden leaps rather than gradual transitions.

### **The Evolutionary Puzzle**
- **Timeline Highlights:**
  - Hominids emerged around 14 million years ago.
  - Homo erectus appeared 2 million years ago, followed by Neanderthals.
  - **35,000 years ago:** Cro-Magnon Man (modern Homo sapiens) suddenly replaced Neanderthals.
  - This abrupt transition defies the slow pace of evolutionary change, as evidenced by Cro-Magnon advancements in art, tools, clothing, and social organization.

- **Scholarly Dilemmas:**
  - Cro-Magnon Man’s advanced civilization emerged during an Ice Age, an unpropitious time for such development.
  - Evolutionary experts, like Professor Theodosius Dobzhansky, admit that Homo sapiens lack clear progenitors, leading to speculation about their origin.

---

## **Civilization’s Mysterious Birth**
- **Rapid Development:** Over a span of mere millennia, humans transitioned from primitive tool use to advanced social structures and agriculture.
  - Cro-Magnon civilization marked a sharp cultural leap, with evidence of religious practices, burial rites, and sophisticated tools.
  - Scholars remain puzzled by humanity’s unexpected advancement, wondering if it resulted from external intervention.

### **The Near East: Cradle of Civilization**
- The Near East played a central role in early human progress:
  - Archaeological sites in the region, such as Shanidar Cave, reveal evidence of early Homo sapiens habitation and advanced practices dating back 100,000 years.
  - **11,000 B.C.:** "Thinking Man" reemerged after a long decline, initiating agriculture and animal domestication.
  - Key domesticated plants (wheat, barley, grapes) and animals (dogs, sheep, goats) originated in this region.

### **Biblical Parallels:**
- The Old Testament aligns with scientific findings:
  - The cultivation of plants and the domestication of animals described in Genesis parallel archaeological records from the Near East.
  - The location of "Eden," identified as east of Israel in a land watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, corresponds to Mesopotamia.

---

## **Cultural Regression and Revival**
- After initial progress, human culture experienced periods of regression:
  - **Circa 4500 B.C.:** Decline in pottery quality and cultural impoverishment is evident.
- **Circa 4000 B.C.:** Civilization in the Near East resurged dramatically, giving rise to the greatest early human cultures, laying the foundation for modern societies.

---

## **Key Themes**
1. **Sudden Leaps in Evolution:** The appearance of Homo sapiens and advanced civilizations occurred in rapid bursts, contrasting with gradual evolutionary theories.
2. **The Role of the Near East:** This region served as the epicenter for humanity's cultural, agricultural, and technological innovations.
3. **Intervention Hypotheses:** The chapter hints at the possibility of external or divine influence in humanity's development, aligning with ancient texts like the Bible.

# Summary of Chapter 12: **The Creation of Man**

This chapter examines the origins of humanity as recorded in Sumerian texts and their biblical parallels, presenting a narrative that intertwines ancient mythology, genetic manipulation, and evolutionary theory. It argues that Homo sapiens were deliberately created by the Nefilim (Sumerian gods) through advanced genetic engineering, bridging gaps between evolutionary science and religious creation accounts.

---

## **1. The Sumerian Perspective on Creation**
- **Purpose of Creation:**
  - According to Sumerian texts, humans (lulu amelu, or "primitive workers") were created to relieve the Nefilim of labor.
  - This task-oriented creation aligns with biblical accounts, such as Adam's placement in Eden "to till it and tend it."

- **The Assembly of Gods:**
  - The decision to create humans was made in a divine assembly, paralleling the plural usage of "Elohim" in Genesis, where God says, "Let us make man in our image."

- **Physical and Mental Likeness:**
  - Humans were fashioned in both the physical and emotional likeness of the gods, sharing their attributes while remaining mortal.

---

## **2. Evolution and Genetic Manipulation**
- **Reconciling Evolution and Creation:**
  - The Sumerian texts suggest humans were not spontaneously created but evolved from pre-existing life forms. This aligns with evolutionary theory while attributing the leap to Homo sapiens to divine intervention.

- **Genetic Engineering:**
  - The Nefilim used advanced techniques to modify Homo erectus, creating Homo sapiens.
  - Texts describe this process as "binding the image of the gods" upon an existing creature, likely through genetic manipulation, akin to cloning or cell fusion.

- **Evidence of Experiments:**
  - Early attempts to create humans resulted in deformed or sterile beings, as described in Sumerian tales and depicted in Mesopotamian art.

---

## **3. The Role of Divine Elements**
- **Divine Blood and Earthly Clay:**
  - The mixture of godly blood (symbolizing genetic material) and earthly clay (likely an ovum) was essential in human creation.
  - The Hebrew term *adama* (red soil) shares linguistic roots with *dam* (blood), emphasizing this fusion.

- **Scientific Parallels:**
  - Modern genetics supports the idea of cross-species fertilization, aligning with the accounts of the gods' blood being mixed with earthly material to create life.

---

## **4. Biblical and Sumerian Parallels**
- **The Garden of Eden:**
  - Both texts describe humanity's creation west of Mesopotamia and their subsequent relocation to Eden for labor.
  - The Sumerians referred to the "Land of Mines" (Abzu) as the site of early human activity, paralleling Eden's description as a fertile and productive area.

- **Creation of Woman:**
  - Sumerian texts explain that Eve was created using Adam’s "essence," clarifying the biblical narrative of her being formed from his rib. The term *ti* (rib/life) in Sumerian is the origin of this wordplay.

---

## **5. Chronological Context**
- **Timeframe of Creation:**
  - Based on Sumerian records, the Nefilim first arrived on Earth 450,000 years ago, creating Homo sapiens approximately 300,000 years ago after 144,000 years of toil.

- **Periods of Reign:**
  - Sumerian king lists detail rulers who governed in cycles of *shar* (3,600 years), reflecting the periodic return of Nefilim from their planet.

---

## **6. Process of Mass Production**
- **Initial Creation:**
  - The first human, "Adapa" (Adam), served as a prototype.
  - After success, duplicates were created using fourteen "birth goddesses," producing both male and female humans in pairs.

- **Technological Insight:**
  - The texts describe surgical and laboratory-like procedures, including tools for cutting umbilical cords and "purifying baths."

---

## **7. Ethical and Philosophical Implications**
- **Man’s Subservient Role:**
  - Humans were designed as workers, reflecting the hierarchical relationship between gods and men.
  - Worship in ancient contexts often meant serving the gods through labor rather than spiritual devotion.

- **Divine-Human Kinship:**
  - The infusion of godly essence established a genetic connection, making humanity a unique hybrid of earthly and divine traits.

---

## **Conclusion**
This chapter bridges mythological narratives with modern scientific theories, suggesting that humanity's sudden emergence as Homo sapiens was not a natural evolutionary step but the result of deliberate genetic manipulation by advanced beings. The parallels between Sumerian and biblical accounts further validate this perspective, presenting a unified origin story that challenges conventional understanding.

# Detailed Summary of Chapter 13: *The End of All Flesh*

---

This chapter explores the origins of biblical narratives such as the Garden of Eden, the Fall of Man, and the Great Flood. Drawing from Sumerian and Mesopotamian texts, it provides a reinterpretation of these stories as records of interactions between humanity and extraterrestrial beings, specifically the Nefilim. The focus is on humanity's genetic engineering, loss of immortality, and eventual near-destruction by a catastrophic Deluge.

---

### Key Themes and Topics

1. **The Garden of Eden and the "Knowing"**:
   - The biblical story of Adam and Eve is reframed as a narrative about humanity's genetic manipulation by the Nefilim.
   - The "knowing" gained by Adam and Eve after eating the forbidden fruit is interpreted as sexual awareness and the ability to procreate, which was initially suppressed by the Nefilim.
   - Enki, associated with wisdom and knowledge, is posited as the "Serpent" who enabled humanity's advancement.

2. **Human Genetic Engineering**:
   - Early humans were created as hybrids, incapable of reproduction—a condition similar to sterile hybrids like mules.
   - The Nefilim genetically modified humans to enable procreation, a development marked symbolically by the story of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden.

3. **The Conflict Between Enki and Enlil**:
   - Enki, the pro-human protagonist, sought to uplift humanity by giving them knowledge and reproductive capabilities.
   - Enlil, a more authoritarian figure, resisted these advancements and later orchestrated the Deluge to wipe out humanity.

4. **The Great Flood**:
   - The biblical account of Noah's Ark is paralleled by the Sumerian tale of Ziusudra (Utnapishtim in Akkadian), who was forewarned by Enki about the impending Deluge.
   - The Deluge is described as a deliberate act by Enlil to eradicate humanity due to their genetic "impurity" and interbreeding with the gods.

5. **The Survival of Humanity**:
   - Enki defied the council of gods and secretly helped Ziusudra construct a vessel to preserve humanity and other life forms.
   - Post-Deluge, humanity was allowed to procreate and repopulate the Earth, though the event marked a turning point in humanity's relationship with the gods.

6. **Sumerian and Biblical Parallels**:
   - Numerous parallels exist between the Mesopotamian accounts and the Bible, including the ark's construction, the use of birds to determine if the waters receded, and the sacrifices made upon survival.
   - Unlike the Bible's single deity narrative, the Sumerian texts depict a council of gods with conflicting agendas.

7. **Post-Deluge Humanity**:
   - After the flood, humanity was divided into "categories," and new social and reproductive guidelines were established.
   - The survivors were tasked with repopulating the Earth, symbolizing a new beginning under divine watch.

---

### Notable References and Evidence

1. **The Garden of Eden**:
   - The Tree of Knowing and the Tree of Life are linked to Sumerian myths of genetic manipulation and restricted immortality.

2. **Artifacts and Texts**:
   - Sumerian artifacts depict the gods engaging in acts of creation, including Enki and Ninti, the goddess of birth, overseeing human production lines.
   - The Mesopotamian "Epic of Gilgamesh" provides details about Utnapishtim’s survival of the flood and his subsequent elevation to immortality.

3. **Deluge Accounts**:
   - The Sumerian story of Ziusudra parallels Noah's tale but highlights the dissent among the gods, with Enki as humanity's secret benefactor.

4. **Scientific and Symbolic Interpretations**:
   - The hybrid nature of early humans and their sterility align with modern genetic understanding.
   - The descriptions of the ark, floodwaters, and Mount Ararat match both biblical and Mesopotamian narratives.

---

### Conclusion

This chapter reinterprets ancient texts as records of humanity's engineered evolution, its acquisition of reproductive abilities, and its survival through the intervention of sympathetic gods like Enki. The stories of the Garden of Eden and the Great Flood reflect humanity's complex relationship with its creators, blending themes of punishment, salvation, and the pursuit of knowledge. These narratives mark pivotal moments in the early history of Homo sapiens, shaping their trajectory as independent beings on Earth.

# Chapter XIV: When the Gods Fled from Earth – Summary

## Overview

This chapter examines the cataclysmic event of the Great Deluge (Flood), its origins, consequences, and implications for both humans and the extraterrestrial "gods" (Nefilim). It explores ancient Mesopotamian and biblical accounts, supported by geological and climatic evidence, to reconstruct the event's timeline and impact.

---

## The Nature of the Deluge

### Distinction from Local Floods
- Archaeological evidence, such as Sir Leonard Woolley’s excavation at Ur, indicates multiple flood strata in Mesopotamia, but these do not explain the global and transformative nature of the Great Deluge.
- Unlike regional inundations, the Deluge was a global catastrophe, described as affecting "the four corners of the Earth."

### Climatic and Geological Context
- The Deluge marked the abrupt end of Earth's last ice age, about 13,000 years ago, characterized by sudden warming and massive flooding.
- The event was likely triggered by the collapse of Antarctic ice sheets into the ocean, causing immense tidal waves and widespread devastation.

---

## Myths and Historical Accounts

### Sumerian and Biblical Parallels
- Both Mesopotamian texts (e.g., **Epic of Gilgamesh**) and the Bible detail a global flood, involving a chosen survivor (Utnapishtim/Noah) instructed to build a vessel.
- Enki (Ea) secretly informed Atra-Hasis (Utnapishtim) of the impending flood, advising him to construct a submersible ark.

### The Role of the Nefilim
- The gods, aware of the coming catastrophe due to their advanced astronomical knowledge, planned to save themselves, leaving humanity to perish.
- They fled Earth in spacecraft, observing the devastation from orbit, as recorded in Mesopotamian and Assyrian texts.

---

## Timeline of the Event

1. **Prelude**:
   - Severe drought and pestilences (described as seven "passings") afflicted humanity before the flood, caused by climatic instability during the ice age.
   - Enlil sought to decimate humanity through famine and diseases.

2. **Flood Preparation**:
   - Enki’s defiance of the divine oath to withhold knowledge of the Deluge led him to warn Utnapishtim indirectly by speaking to a reed screen.
   - Utnapishtim was instructed to construct a hermetically sealed vessel capable of withstanding turbulent waters.

3. **The Deluge**:
   - Torrential rains and rising seas submerged the land, with waters originating from the south (Antarctic collapse).
   - Biblical and Mesopotamian texts describe the rain lasting 40 days and the waters subsiding after 150 days.

4. **Post-Deluge**:
   - The ark rested on Mount Ararat, and Utnapishtim offered sacrifices that attracted the hungry gods.
   - Enlil reconciled with humanity, recognizing its necessity for life on Earth.

---

## Astronomical and Geological Correlations

### Connection to the Twelfth Planet
- The Deluge coincided with the periodic passage of the **Twelfth Planet (Nibiru)**, which caused gravitational disturbances leading to ice sheet collapse.
- Ancient texts describe the planet as "causing the Flood" and associate its passage with the Age of the Lion (10,860–8700 B.C.).

### Scientific Evidence
- Ice core data and ocean sediment analysis confirm abrupt climatic shifts and rising sea levels around 13,000 years ago.
- Dr. John T. Hollin’s theory of Antarctic ice slippage explains the mechanics of such a massive tidal wave.

---

## Legacy of the Deluge

### Human Survival and Rebuilding
- Survivors like Utnapishtim became the basis for post-Deluge civilizations.
- The event marked the transition from prehistoric societies to the rise of historical civilizations.

### Impact on the Gods
- The Nefilim’s attachment to Earth led to internal conflicts among them, reflecting their dependence on humanity and the planet's resources.
