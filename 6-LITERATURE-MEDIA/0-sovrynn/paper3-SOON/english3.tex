\begin{abstract}
In May 2024, a pseudonymous online author known as “The Ethical Skeptic” \cite{0} shared a groundbreaking theory called the Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) \cite{1}. This theory suggests that Earth has previously experienced sudden, catastrophic shifts in its rotational axis, triggering massive worldwide floods as the oceans spilled over the continents due to rotational inertia. Additionally, it presents an explanatory geophysical process and data indicating that another such flip may be imminent. While such cataclysmic flood and doomsday predictions are not new, the ECDO theory is uniquely compelling due to its scientific, modern, multidisciplinary, and data-based approach.

This paper is my third work \cite{2,3} on this topic, and focuses on present-day political aspects of this theory:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Whistleblower testimonies that Western powers believe a geophysical cataclysm is imminent and plan to take political and military advantage of the event.
    \item Evidence of extensive Western underground and undersea bases built to prepare for the event.
    \item Evidence of massive amounts of money being drained from Western currency structures to fund these bases.
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

This paper documents the extensive preparations Western ruling powers are carrying out to prepare for a geophysical cataclysm they believe to be imminent.

\section{Freemasonry and the "Anglo-Saxon Mission"}

In January 2010, Project Camelot, an alternative media and journalism organization which compiles whistleblower testimonies, interviewed \cite{4,6} an insider who was physically present at a meeting of Senior Masons in the City of London in June 2005. The topics discussed at the meeting were military and political plans centered around a backdrop of a coming \textbf{"geophysical event"}, i.e., a global natural disaster.

\begin{figure}[b]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[t]

   \caption{The British Empire in 1937, a formidable display of Anglo-Saxon might \cite{14}.}
   \label{fig:2}
\end{figure*}

According to this insider, the 25-30 people present at the meeting were \textit{"...all British, and some of them are very well known characters who people in the United Kingdom will recognize immediately... there is a bit of aristocracy there, and some of them come from quite aristocratic backgrounds. There's one who I identified at that meeting who is a senior politician. Two others were senior figures from the police, and one from the military. Both are known nationally and both are key figures in advising the present government — at this present time"} \cite{4}. The insider says that he attended the meeting,\ \textit{"By sheer accident! I thought it was a normal three-monthly meeting... I went to this meeting and it was not the meeting that I was expecting. I believe I was invited... because of the position I held and because they believed that, like themselves, I was one of them."} \cite{4}.

The basic timeline of events discussed at the meeting (in 2005) is as follows:

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Goading Iran or China into using a tactical nuclear weapon and bringing about a limited nuclear exchange, and then establishing a ceasefire.
    \item Unleashing biological weapons on China, reportedly the main target "since the 70s".
    \item Ushering in totalitarian military governments justified by the resulting fear and chaos.
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

But the most important thing is what is expected to come after these events: \textit{"So we're going to head into this war, then after that... there will be a geophysical event taking place on Earth which is going to affect everybody"} \cite{4}. The insider believes that during this geophysical event, \textit{\textbf{"the Earth's crust is going to shift round about 30 degrees, about 1700 to 2000 miles southwards, and it will cause a huge upheaval, effects of which will last for a very long time to come"}} \cite{4}.

The reason for all this secret planning is, of course, power. The insider explains, \textit{"Now, by that time we will all have been through a nuclear and biological war. The Earth's population, if this happens, will be drastically reduced. When this geophysical event is going to take place, then those remaining will probably be halved again. And who survives that is going to determine who takes the world and its surviving population into the next era. So we are talking about a post-cataclysmic-event era. Who's going to be in charge? Who's going to be in control? So it's all about that. And that's why they're so desperate for these things to happen within a set timeframe... A structure needs to be in place before [chaos] happens with some sort of certainty that it will survive what's going to come -- so that it can land on both feet the day after, and then remain in power and have the power that it's enjoyed previously"} \cite{4}. During the interview, the name of this plan, the "Anglo-Saxon Mission", is also discussed: \textit{[Interviewer]: "...the reason why it's called The Anglo-Saxon Mission is because basically the plan is to wipe out the Chinese so that after the cataclysm and when things are rebuilt, it will be the Anglo-Saxons who are in a position to rebuild and inherit the new Earth, with no one else around. Is that right?" [Insider]: "Whether that's right I really don't know, but I would agree with you. Through the 20th century at least, and even before into the 19th and 18th centuries, the history of this world has been predominantly run from the West and from the Northern region on the planet"} \cite{4}.

Regarding the exact timeframe of the expected geophysical event, the insider offers his best guess: \textit{"...the feeling, and it's a very intuitive one, is that they've got to get their act together now... I think they've got a good idea of when it's going to happen... \textbf{I've got this very strong feeling that it's going to happen in my lifetime, say within 20 years}... we've now entered into that period where this geophysical event is about to take place, when we consider the length of time that's passed since the last one which happened about 11,500 years ago, and it happens round about 11,500 years, cyclically. It's now due to happen again... They understand it's going to happen. They have a certainty of knowledge that it's going to happen... Again, it's one of these things -- it would be inconceivable if they didn't know. I mean, the best brains in the world will be working for them on this"} \cite{4}.

This is a powerful testimony for which we should be very grateful. In the interview, the author also discusses his belief that WWI and WWII were manufactured wars, and that the Anglo-Saxon Mission almost certainly dates back many, many generations. It has now been 15 years since the interview, which occurred in 2010. There are five years remaining until the insider's stated 20-year timeframe prediction for the geophysical event reaches its end.

\subsection{Druidic Esoteric Western Knowledge of Cataclysms}

Western knowledge of recurring cataclysms is well kept, and not just by Freemasons. The Druids, a well-documented ancient Celtic culture dating back at least 2400 years \cite{7}, passed on knowledge about the Earth's recurring cataclysms. The last known Druid is believed to be Ben McBrady. In "The Last Druid", a 1992 documentary, he shared information about the knowledge of the Druids: \textit{"The order of which I may be the last member by tradition, came into existence after the last great cataclysm, or catastrophe, which affected the world. Now with these great and terrible impacts on the Earth by great electrical storms, being caught up in the tails of meteors, or showers of meteorites, civilization as we know it was totally destroyed... All knowledge came within the ambit of the order, but they were particularly concerned with astronomy because they had experienced so many very significant calamities. It was thought that a full knowledge of astronomy would enable them to predict conditions when these calamities were likely to take place and take some kind of action to protect themselves. If you look at the great megalithic complexes in Ireland you'll see that what are described as passage graves are really bomb shelters of a very primitive kind. They are well above any tidal wave level and they also afford protection from meteoric showers"} \cite{8,9}.

% It is also believed that Freemasonry itself actually originates from the Druids \cite{10}.

\section{Evidence of Present-Day Western Cataclysm Preparation}

Given that the ruling Western powers seem to believe that a global geophysical cataclysm is imminent, we would expect significant preparations to be occurring to protect themselves from such an event. And indeed, there is evidence in the public domain of extensive networks of deep underground bases across multiple Western countries. While such installations would certainly protect inhabitants in a nuclear war, they would also serve as protection from various kinds of natural disasters. Given the testimony of the British Senior Freemason from Project Camelot \cite{4,6}, it seems that these scenarios are not possibilities, but rather, premeditated plans. Also of note is the tremendous amount of money that would be required to build, staff, and maintain these bases, which lines up neatly with amounts such as a hefty tens of trillions of dollars missing from the US government over 18 years (covered in the next section) \cite{11,12,13}. Other examples of preparation for an extinction-level event include various archival projects such as seed and knowledge vaults.

\subsection{American Underground and Undersea Bases}

The most extensive public investigation into underground bases that I have found is from Richard Sauder, an independent American researcher who has published several books about deep underground bases \cite{22}. Sauder's work consists of archiving government documents and plans, perusing historical and present news stories and technologies, cultivating sources, and compiling insider claims. Sauder's research reveals that there is a large network of deep underground and undersea bases in and around America and its territories (Figure \ref{fig:4}), reaching to potential depths of at least 3 miles, and potentially connected by underground vacuum tube high-speed magnetic levitation trains. These bases are discreetly funded through a \textit{"high finance, international, interagency, money laundering shell game"} run by the same people who own the company of the United States of America \cite{22}. A follow-up work done into the extent of these bases by Catherine Austin Fitts (whose work is covered in the next section) and one of her collaborators produced an estimate of 170 underground and undersea American bases \cite{16,20}.

   \label{fig:4}
\end{figure*}

Here are some testimony snippets from Sauder's sources that detail the extent of some of these bases:

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Camp David, Maryland: \textit{"My source informed me that the underground portions of Camp David are so extensive and elaborate, and there are so many miles of secret tunnels, that it is doubtful that any one person would have a complete map of the facility in his or her mind"} \cite{22}.
    \item The White House, Washington DC: \textit{"One of my close friends was taken down into this facility during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration in the 1960s. She entered an elevator in the White House and was escorted straight down. She believes that the elevator went down 17 levels. When the door opened underground she was escorted down a corridor that appeared to disappear to the vanishing point in the distance. Other doors and corridors opened off of that corridor"} \cite{22}. Depicted in Figure \ref{fig:3}.
    \item Fort Meade, Maryland - from a source who accidentally stumbled into the "basement" in the 1970s: \textit{"I opened the door and it was a stairwell leading down. I went over to the edge and looked down between the railings. I didn't count the number of floors down, but I had the feeling it was about 15-20 floors... I walked down one flight and there was a door... I opened the door and stuck my head through and looked left and right and saw a tunnel which ran clear out of sight in both directions. It was definitely much further than the area covered by the building and parking lot at ground level. There were doors along the opposite walls spaced about 30-40 feet apart... I decided to check out a couple of more floors so I walked down another level... and saw the same layout... I went down one more floor and looked in and saw the same as the first 2 floors"} \cite{22}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

\end{figure}

Sauder also received testimonies about underground magnetic levitation trains that reach speeds of 2,000 mph, bases built under the ocean floor (Figure \ref{fig:5}), and underwater submarine tunnels that lead inland. Regarding one of the testimonies about an underwater base in the Gulf of Mexico, Sauder says, \textit{"About a half year after the publication of Underwater and Underground Bases, I was contacted by a man who said he had knowledge of an unusual underwater project... he specified that the project was under the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico, and that Parsons was the contractor. He went on to say that Parsons had purchased some specialty equipment intended for operation 2,800 feet beneath the sea floor... The equipment is distinctive enough that it clearly presupposes the presence of live human beings in the places where it is installed"} \cite{22}.

If there really is a vast secret transcontinental network of 170+ underground and undersea bases dug to depths of miles beneath the surface under our feet, connected by hypersonic vacuum-tube maglev trains, funded using the fruits of our labor, the masses of humanity today would be in a state of terminal and blissful ignorance, not only unaware of what is under them but what lies ahead of them in the near future, as they lap up the empty and coordinated statements of their politician handlers.

An additional note - the existence of large underground tunnel networks has been revealed without a doubt in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East (Hamas tunnels under the Gaza Strip \cite{38}, and Iran's underground "missile city" (Figure \ref{fig:12}) \cite{39,40}). These should leave no doubt as to both the possibility of building, and actual existence of, such structures. They should also leave us wondering what structures other significantly better capitalized countries may have constructed during the same time.

\subsection{Additional Bunker and Cataclysm Preparation Evidence}

\begin{figure}[t]

\label{fig:8}
\label{fig:onecol}
\end{figure}

There are plenty of additional clues of cataclysm preparation around the world aside from the underground American royal bases. Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland are great examples:

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project Camelot shared a relevant testimony from a Norwegian politician \cite{25,26}, whose identity they verified but kept private. He alleges that Norway has 18 extensive underground bases, and that Norway (along with Israel and "many other countries") is building these bases to prepare for some kind of natural disaster. Richard Sauder also received a testimony from a man who had been inside a massive underground base built inside a hollowed-out mountain in Norway \cite{22}.
    \item Switzerland is well known to have many nuclear bunkers built in the heights of the Alps (Figure \ref{fig:7}). These number over an astonishing 370,000 - enough to shelter every single resident \cite{27}.
    \item Sweden and Finland have enough bunkers to shelter residents in every major city \cite{27}. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

Silicon Valley business tycoons are apparently also in the know. Reportedly, \textit{"Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of LinkedIn and a notable investor, told The New Yorker earlier this year he estimated that more than 50\% of Silicon Valley billionaires had bought some level of "apocalypse insurance," like an underground bunker... According to Jim Dobson, a Forbes contributor, lots of billionaires have private planes "ready to depart at a moment's notice." They also own motorcycles, weaponry, and generators"} \cite{28}.

There are also various large archival projects such as the Global Knowledge Vault, run by the Arch Mission Foundation, \cite{29} and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault \cite{30} which seem to be preparing to preserve humanity's vital assets in the case of an extinction-level disaster.

\section{Democratic Funding Mechanisms for Massive Underground Bases}

So how are massive transcontinental networks of 170+ underground and undersea bases funded whilst keeping the debt slaves in the dark? There's one paper trail that can give us an idea of the scale of money that goes into these projects and where it comes from. In 2017, Catherine Austin Fitts, an American investment banker and former public official during the Bush administration, and Mark Skidmore, a Michigan State University economist, found 21 trillion USD in unauthorized spending in the US government during fiscal years 1998-2015 \cite{11,12,13}.

According to their report, \textit{"On October 7, 2016 Reuters published an article by Scot Paltrow (2016), which reported that in fiscal year 2015 the Army made \$6.5 trillion in unsupported accounting adjustments “to create an illusion that its books were balanced.” Given that the Army general fund budget in that year was \$122 billion, this was an astounding revelation... The DOD made major media headlines many years earlier for its accounting problems on September 10, 2001 when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in a Congressional hearing (C-SPAN, 2014) that the DOD had lost track of \$2.3 trillion in transactions... This acknowledgement made news headlines on that day, but was forgotten a day later when the tragedy of 9/11 captured the attention of the entire world... When Professor Mark Skidmore learned of the \$6.5 trillion in unverifiable Army transactions, he contacted Ms. Fitts and they agreed in the spring of 2017 to work together to identify other similar government reports that indicated unusually large unverifiable transactions within HUD and DOD. Over the course of the next six months, Skidmore, Fitts and a small team of graduate students collected official government documents wherein a total of \$21 trillion in undocumentable transactions were identified during the 1998-2016 period"} \cite{12}.

Across the same 18-year period spanning 1998-2015, publicly acknowledged US government receipts were only 40.8 trillion \cite{15}, indicating that an amount of over half of US government receipts was secretly spent on underground bases in addition to publicly acknowledged US government spending. Also noteworthy is that this secret spending occurred on top of a long-running budget deficit, and has presumably not only continued till today but also existed before 1998, implying the total nominal amount spent on these bases is much greater than 21 trillion dollars. Applying the same ratio of secret spending to the period spanning 2016-2023 yields a total amount of 36.6 trillion USD spent since 1998.

In 2021, Mark Skidmore published an update to this research concerning an announcement by Bloomberg that during fiscal years 2017-19, the Pentagon recorded a mind-boggling 94.7 trillion dollars of accounting adjustments \cite{17,18}. If we take into account the counterfeiting of US dollars via the central banking system that has occurred for over a century since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913 \cite{37}, it becomes clear that all public dollar accounting is complete doublespeak bunk, and that the US currency and government are simply resource allocation systems from which its royal owners can quietly skim off (or rather, pour out) however much they want.

\section{Progeny of Jove: Identities of the Shadow Western Kings}

So, who's actually running the show? We cannot know for sure, because the Western kings of capital keep themselves in the shadows. While there are all kinds of theories, spanning from public figures to extraterrestrial beings, the best answer I have to this lies in the life work of an anonymous blogger who went by the pseudonym "Amallulla". His work constituted an expansive synthesis of over 20 authors and 50 "irreplaceable" documents covering topics of ancient and modern history, occult symbolism, and Western politics \cite{33,34}. I can only describe his work as "prophetic" regarding the impending geophysical cataclysm - it is \textit{significantly} more comprehensive than mine.

Amallulla identified three political Western factions, which together he called the "Progeny of Jove", who possess knowledge of the "end times" - Earth's recurring cataclysms. He believed these three factions together control the Western nations today, but divided them into three different groups based on their differing origins and historical identities, possible past disagreements, and perceived differences in their value systems and actions.

The three factions can be vaguely categorized as follows:

\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Bankers}: The ancient Roman Elite, who turned into the Knights Templar and the Northern Jurisdiction of Freemasons in America.
    \item \textbf{The Thinkers}: The Rosicrucians and the Southern American Freemasons.
    \item \textbf{The Jesuits and Black Pope}: The faction of the progeny of Jove within the Roman Catholic Church.
\end{enumerate}
\end{flushleft}

Today, these three factions together comprise the European Illuminati, Freemasons, and CIA. As Amallulla described, \textit{"Right now, in the end-time, the progeny of Jove are well-hidden behind need-to-know clearances that exclude even the sitting President of the United States of America. In other words, they have perfected the art of hiding themselves from public scrutiny. \textbf{The progeny of Jove not only control the military and government of the United States of America, but through the power of fiat currency, major corporations, and the Republic form of government they invented (knowing the politicians would be easily corrupted and thereby controlled), they control the entire Western world}"} \cite{33,34}.

\begin{figure}[t]

   \caption{Just who are the Progeny of Jove? (Image: \cite{35})}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]

   \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{pike.jpg}
\end{center}
   \caption{The famed Pike Peak batholith, highlighted in red, along with the landscape of the western United States \cite{36}. Could the United States of America really have been conceived in order to control this location?}
\label{fig:11}
\label{fig:onecol}
\end{figure}

According to Amallulla, these people scorn religion, manipulate sacred books in the world's major religions to their benefit, and use symbolism heavily. Additionally, they are merciless when it comes to their enemies: \textit{"\textbf{Over a period of more than 2,600 years, they have systematically eliminated anyone else who possessed specific knowledge of the end times. And by this, I do not mean to say only the druids, Jewish kabbalists, ancient Egyptians, Arabs, and Indian mystics, but the Elongated Skulls in South America and the Maya priests in Central America, too. And the evidence that they annihilated a once-thriving population in North America in order to preserve this as The Land of the End Times is positively overwhelming. The genocide of American “Indians” was merely a mopping-up operation}"} \cite{33,34}.

Amallulla also believed that the entire "United States of America" project was carried out for the purpose of securing control of the "Pike's Peak Batholith", a granite mountain range in the Rocky Mountains that offers excellent protection from a geophysical disaster (Figure \ref{fig:11}). According to Amallulla, \textit{"Before, during, and after what we think of as the Civil War, the bankers and thinkers have battled not so much for the control of The United States of America, but for Pikes Peak batholith, which is one of the most unique granite batholiths in the whole world... There is no other granite batholith at such a high altitude and so far from an ocean shore anywhere else in the world. It is the ideal location for surviving an Earth crustal displacement"} \cite{33,34}. Amallulla's research revealed that there is an extensive underground tunnel system built under and around this area today \cite{36}.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper I have detailed various testimonies that suggest Western elites have carefully preserved knowledge of Earth's recurring cataclysms for thousands of years, believe another one is imminent, have built extensive underground shelters to prepare for such an event, and are planning to take advantage of such an event politically and militarily to achieve world domination. I have mentioned clues as to how this was funded in America, as well as referenced the least far-fetched theory regarding the exact bloodlines that are running this show. For those who wish to know more, there is plenty of additional information I've left out that can be found by digging through the references.

The strongest measurable data point pointing to an impending geophysical event is Earth's rapidly shifting geomagnetic field. This is measurable not only the accelerating movement of the magnetic north pole (Figure \ref{fig:13}) and the growing of the South Atlantic geomagnetic anomaly, but in the general accelerating weakening and distortion of the geomagnetic field over the last 400 years \cite{3}. Such scientific data is discussed at length in my first two ECDO papers, accessible on my website \cite{3}.

In closing, I will leave you with this quote from the prophetic Amallulla, explaining how \textit{"\textbf{everything is one thing}"}: \textit{"Here I must of necessity push your imagination to the uttermost boundaries. You must forget about the world in which you now live and have known since childhood. Leave it behind you. It is an entirely fabricated reality not unlike the one portrayed in the Matrix movie and intended to keep you asleep until the last moment. Sometimes I wish I were writing a script for a movie, but what I am sharing with you on this website is real. It took me over half a decade to realize “Everything is one thing,” which I quickly adopted as the motto for An Apocalyptic Synthesis. This is a difficult concept to convey. For now, let us think in terms of the Matrix movie. It is a good analogy. What I find difficult to convey is that what I am about to say is not an exaggeration. For now, the Matrix movie analogy is as close as I can come to make you understand the stark reality of what I am about to say. \textbf{Everything in your life, including all of recorded history, mainstream, consensus science and academia, politics, religion, everything in one way or another is about the coming Earth crustal displacement or axial tilt.} You just don’t see it right now. Nor can you awaken to this reality as if from a bad dream. It takes time. But I promise you, the end of this road is the realization that you have been living in the equivalent of the Matrix computer-simulated reality your entire life"} \cite{33,34}.

Good luck to all.
