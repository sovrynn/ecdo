While the uniformitarian school of geological thought ascribes anomalies such as salt and marine fossils to drawn-out processes occurring over millions of years, humanity's flood stories should lead us to question that line of thinking. If the ocean really did flood over the continents, then saltwater and marine fossils, easily discovered across vast expanses of high-elevation land, are exactly what we would expect to find.
