This is page is a mess right now, but it's still my baby. There is profound wisdom on this page, some of the best work of my life, moments of realization that will remain with me as does the memories of other men's (more normal) lives when they asked a lover to marry them or witnessed the birth of their first child. But this work is unrecognized and my guess is that it shall forever remain so. I am speaking mainly of the realization of the significance of Noah's flood being caused by rain, which clearly links it to the explosion of Proto-Saturn and the subsequent disintegration of the polar configuration. To this, I would add the significance of Seneca the Younger describing the polar configuration of the planets thousands of years ago and the realization that Plato never mentions a bright light when discussing the end of the Atlantis culture. Rooms of so-called \"scientists\" and multi-million dollar equipment were never going to lead to such realizations. However, thinking does.LAST UPDATE: January 8, 2021","name":"\u2116 38.

<p class="page-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PAGE STATUS</strong></span>:
 What can I say? This is page is a mess right now, but it’s still my 
baby. There is profound wisdom on this page, some of the best work of my
 life, moments of realization that will remain with me as does the 
memories of other men’s (more normal) lives when they asked a lover to 
marry them or witnessed the birth of their first child. But this work is
 unrecognized and my guess is that it shall forever remain so. I am 
speaking mainly of the realization of the significance of Noah’s flood 
being caused by rain, which clearly links it to the explosion of 
Proto-Saturn and the subsequent disintegration of the polar 
configuration. To this, I would add the significance of Seneca the 
Younger describing the polar configuration of the planets thousands of 
years ago and the realization that Plato never mentions a bright light 
when discussing the end of the Atlantis culture. Rooms of so-called 
“scientists” and multi-million dollar equipment were never going to lead
 to such realizations. However, <em>thinking</em> does.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: January 8, 2021</p>

<hr><p><span style="font-size: 36px;">I see no point in pulling my punches on this particular religious insanity. On page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/prophesy/">№ 102. There are No Prophets</a>, I explain why I think it is preposterous to believe that “God”—or <em>the fabric of the universe</em>
 as I like to think of the “I am that I am” essence of being—talks to a 
select class of individuals (usually men) referred to as “prophets.” 
This anthropomorphic concept of the “big guy in the sky”—as George 
Carlon describes it—is sheer delusion, the mark of a primitive people. 
A&nbsp;certain class of thinkers will dismiss my work on this basis and 
think of me as evil for saying so. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>So be it.</em></strong></span>
 I had little chance of ever reaching this class of thinkers in the 
first place. They are waiting for the Third Temple to be built not 
realizing the progenitors of the people in and around Denver, Colorado 
who control access to the multi-trillion dollar granite tunnel system in
 the Pikes Peak batholith wrote that book and planted it in the Bible. 
This is not a game that suffers fools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">So what is this biblical text saying?</span></p>
<div class="bible-verse">
<p>Genesis 9:8-17</p>
<p>And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>
<p>And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;</p>
<p>And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the 
cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out 
of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>
<p>And I will establish my covenant with you; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>neither
 shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither 
shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth</em></strong></span>.</p>
<p>And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between 
me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual 
generations:</p>
<p>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>
<p>And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh</em></strong></span>.</p>
<p>And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I 
may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living 
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>
<p>And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I 
have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">I am not introducing this page with a 
mindless attack on traditional Judaic and Christian beliefs. There is a 
point I want to make. As you read this page, keep this “promise” in 
mind. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>What the writer is 
saying is that the explosion of Proto-Saturn and the subsequent flooding
 of Earth was a one-off event. It will not happen again, at least not at
 the end of this world.</strong></em></span> If you take this as the 
meaning of Genesis 9:8-17 then you have learned a valuable lesson 
because I assure you the world is about to be flooded again, and much 
more violently than in the aftermath of the Proto-Saturn nova. However, 
this text is correct in that in the aftermath of an Earth crustal 
displacement portions of the planet, such as the interior of Russia, 
will not flood because they are too far from large bodies of water such 
as oceans, seas, and exceptionally large lakes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This difference between a “deluge” caused by “forty days and forty nights” (the <em>forty</em>
 being biblical speak for an unimaginable amount of rain) is skimmed 
over in a 1933 film that caught my attention because of the year in 
which is was released (MCMXXXIII is Roman numerals for <em>19<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>33</strong></span></em>). I honestly believe this is an early version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/"><em>Tomorrowland</em></a>
 film, and for that reason deserves study. It references “God’s covenant
 with Noah” at the start of the film, but the destruction depicted in 
the film clearly comes <em>not from rain</em> but from something akin to
 an Earth crustal displacement in which coastal cities such as New York 
City are erased in a few short hours. These are some pretty impressive 
special effects for the time. I say it is something akin to an Earth 
crustal displacement because there are violent earthquakes everywhere. 
What the film leaves out is the volcanic eruptions that will darken the 
skies for months or years afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I serious? Yes, <em>I truly believe this film was made by the progeny of Jove</em>.
 It has clear parallels in Tomorrowland, especially in the promise of a 
better tomorrow. Watch it from this perspective,—the progeny of Jove 
providing inspiration to their own. Denver, Colorado was founded on 
November 22, 1858, <em>75 years earlier</em>. This film provided them with a visualization of what they are working for. You really should take the time to watch this.</p>

</div></figure><p>Whatever you take away from this early Hollywood 
depiction of an Earth crustal displacement, my main point is that you 
should not confuse what happened in 3105 BC with an Earth crustal 
displacement. The “covenant” God supposedly made with Noah was not to 
flood the world again with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>torrential, non-stop rain</strong></em></span>.
 And of course, this will not happen again because Saturn is a gas giant
 in a very distant orbit, not the “Sun” or brown dwarf remembered by our
 ancestors. <em>But an Earth crustal displacement is an order of magnitude more violent than what happened in 3105 BC and almost as deadly</em>.
 Very few people will survive. I suspect the 500,000,000 mentioned on 
the Georgia Guidestones markedly underestimates the death toll of an 
Earth crustal displacement.&nbsp;</p>

 to explain what happened), the planets were much closer together and 
orbited the Sun all in a straight line with the north pole of one planet
 facing the south pole of the planet in front of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">The word <em>polar</em> is defined as 
“relating to the North or South Pole.” Thus this ancient configuration 
of planets is known as the “polar configuration” because the North Pole 
of Earth pointed to the south pole of Mars; the north pole of Mars 
pointed to the south pole of Venus; the north pole of Venus pointed to 
the south pole of Proto-Saturn; and finally (you guessed it), the north 
pole of Proto-Saturn pointed to the south pole of Jupiter. This 
configuration is also referred to as an <em>axial alignment</em> of planets or a <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">collinear</a> system</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">Jupiter is often not depicted in 
artist’s renditions of the polar configuration of the planets. There is a
 good reason for this. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Proto-Saturn was larger than Jupiter.</em></strong></span>
 Hence, Jupiter was not visible from Earth. And of course, Venus and 
Mars were much smaller, so Proto-Saturn dominated the sky. Being in an 
axial alignment, Proto-Saturn was in the same fixed position as a “pole 
star.” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Polaris</a>,
 sometimes referred to as the North Star, now occupies that very

 was coined by modern comparative mythologist David Talbott, but the 
polar configuration of the planets was described much earlier by by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/classical-eschatology/#Berossus_Caldeus_and_the_final_catastrophe">Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Seneca the Younger)</a> in <em>Naturales quaestiones</em> when he wrote, “…when the planets, which now move in different orbits, all assemble in Cancer, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>so arranged in one row that a straight line may pass through their spheres</em></strong></span>.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">Proto-Saturn was more like a star than
 a gas giant, and it did not have rings back then. In Mesopotamia, 
Proto-Saturn was often referred to as the <em>Sun</em>, a fact that 
perplexes modern academia. It was much closer to Earth and loomed so 
large in the sky that our ancestors regarded it as a god. Hence the term
 <em>Proto-Saturn</em> to differentiate this “god” of our ancestors from the distant planet you and I know of as <em>Saturn</em>. This is the true history of our Solar System which is being hidden from us because the progeny of Jove want you to believe in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/matrix/#Uniformitarianism_or_Gradualism_is_the_biggest_lie_of_all_time_and_designed_to_lull_the_masses_to_sleep"><em>uniformitarianism</em> (or <em>gradualism</em>)</a>

 end—are batshit crazy. (For the record, they are winning that battle.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">Modern cosmology, based as it is on uniformitarianism (read <em>nothing ever changes</em>)
 cannot accept that the planets were once orbited the Sun in a straight 
line. But Wallace Thornhill was keen to point out that, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9</a>

<div class="quote">
<p>I have been asked by the compliers of the Velikovsky archive to 
briefly describe the present condition of Velikovsky’s unpublished 
manuscript entitled<i> In the Beginning.</i> As Velikovsky explains, parts of this volume were already complete in the 1940s and originally formed part of <i>Worlds in Collision. </i>The present manuscript also incorporates material written for a volume entitled <i>The Test of Time, </i>which
 dealt with the new information on the planets coming from the space 
probes, and contained frequent allusions to the earlier catastrophes; 
this work will probably never see publication. Other material included 
in this manuscript comes from Velikovsky’s lectures and other scattered 
writings. During the time that I worked for Velikovsky (1976-1978) one 
of my tasks was to complete the cataloguing of his library notes, mostly
 from the 1940s. The headings of the catalogue generally corresponded to
 the section headings in <i>Worlds in Collision</i> and <i>In the Beginning.</i> The completion of <i>In the Beginning</i>
 was a cooperative effort between Velikovsky and myself. After 
Velikovsky’s passing, when I returned to Princeton to work on his 
archive, I systematically moved the parts contributed by me into the 
notes apparatus and this is how this material appears in the unpublished
 manuscript.</p>

<p>For the reader’s convenience, I recreate the index for <em>In the Beginning</em> below. My links are set to change colors once followed. So you can use this index as I do to keep track of what you have read. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>For the record, I regard this as some of the most important work ever written.</em></strong></span> It deserves a place next to the Bible in terms of understanding the world in which you live.</p>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">Important Note</div>
<p>Leaving aside the technical issues addressed in these papers, the 
main point for the reader to realize is that these are historically 
accurate descriptions of what happened in 3105 BC. They are not 
religious and they are not vague reminisces written is a flowery 
language subject to wild interpretations. Immanuel Velikovsky is quoting
 from disrespected and ignored history books written not long after what
 happened. The other immensely important point to take away from In The 
Beginning is that <em>the Bible is first and foremost a historical record of the planetary catastrophe of 3105 BC</em>.
 The papers related to the water in Earth’s oceans are marked with an 
asterisk followed by a parenthetical note summarizing their main <span style="color: #ff0000;">point</span>. You <em>must</em> read these before proceeding.</p>

 developing a new method for measuring isotopic ratios of water and 
carbon dioxide remotely, scientists have found that the water in 
Saturn’s rings and satellites is unexpectedly like water on the Earth, 
except on Saturn’s moon Phoebe, where the water is more unusual than on 
any other object so far studied in the Solar System.</p>
<p>The results, found in the Icarus paper “Isotopic Ratios of Saturn’s 
Rings and Satellites: Implications for the Origin of Water and Phoebe” 
by Planetary Science Institute Senior Scientist Roger N. Clark, also 
mean we need to change models of the formation of the Solar System 
because the new results are in conflict with existing models. Robert H. 
Brown (U. Arizona), Dale P. Cruikshank (NASA), and Gregg A. Swayze 
(USGS) are co-authors.</p>
<p>Isotopes are different forms of elements but with differing numbers 
of neutrons. Adding a neutron adds mass to the element, and that can 
change processes of how a planet, comet, or moon is formed. Water is 
composed of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen atom, H2O. Adding a 
neutron to one hydrogen atom, then called deuterium (D), increases the 
mass of a water molecule (HDO) by about 5 percent, and that small change
 results in isotopic differences in the formation of a planet, moon, or 
comet, and changes the evaporation of water after formation. The 
deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) is a fingerprint of the formation 
conditions, including temperature and evolution over time. Evaporating 
water enriches deuterium in the remaining surface.</p>
<p>Models for the formation of the Solar System indicate that the D/H 
should be much higher in the colder outer Solar System than in the 
hotter inner system where the Earth formed. Deuterium is more abundant 
in cold molecular clouds. Some models predict the D/H should be 10 times
 higher for the Saturn system than on Earth. But the new measurements 
show this is not the case for Saturn’s rings and satellites except 
Saturn’s moon Phoebe.</p>
<p>The discovery of an unusual deuterium to hydrogen isotopic ratio 
(D/H) for Saturn’s moon Phoebe means it was formed in and comes from a 
far part of the Solar System, Clark said. “Phoebe’s D/H ratio is the 
highest value yet measured in the Solar System, implying an origin in 
the cold outer Solar System far beyond Saturn.”</p>
<p>The team also measured the carbon-13 to carbon-12 (13C/12C) ratio on 
Saturn’s moon Iapetus and Phoebe. Iapetus, which also has D/H similar to
 Earth, also has 13C/12C close to Earth’s values, but Phoebe is almost 
five times higher in the carbon isotope. The carbon dioxide presence 
places limits on how much of Phoebe could have evaporated to space after
 formation, leaving the only possibility that Phoebe formed in the very 
cold outer reaches of the Solar System, much further out than Saturn, 
and was subsequently perturbed into an orbit where it was captured by 
Saturn. Exactly how far out Phoebe originated is unknown. There are 
currently no measurements of D/H or 13C/12C for the icy surfaces on 
Pluto or Kuiper Belt objects beyond Pluto, but this new methodology will
 enable us to make such measurements of the surface ices.</p>
<p>The measurements were made from the NASA Cassini spacecraft using the
 Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) over the course of the 
mission. An improved calibration of the instrument, completed early in 
2018, enabled the precision needed for these measurements of reflected 
light from the rings and satellites. The new method of measuring 
isotopic ratios on solids like water ice and carbon dioxide ice using 
reflectance spectroscopy remotely will enable measurements of isotopic 
ratios for other objects throughout the Solar System, putting further 
constraints on models of Solar System formation.</p>
<p>The Saturn system D/H values close to the Earth’s values imply a 
similar water source for the inner and outer Solar System, and new 
models need to be developed where the change from inner to outer Solar 
System is less.</p>
<p>The NASA Europa Clipper mission could be used to measure isotopic 
ratios on the icy Galilean satellites around Jupiter, and Clark is a 
Co-Investigator on the mission and hopes to make such measurements.</p>

<ul><li><span class="entry">SATURN’S RINGS VISIBLE FROM EARTH</span>:&nbsp;In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://www.varchive.org/itb/rings.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Rings of Saturn</em></a>, Velikovsky makes it abundantly clear that the rings of Saturn “were visible to the naked eye at some time in the past” <em>to people all over the globe</em>
 including even such primitive cultures as the “aboriginees [sic] of 
America before Columbus discovered the land” and the “Maoris of New 
Zealand.”&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="entry">NO EVIDENCE OF ADVANCED LENSES IN EXISTENCE WORLDWIDE</span>:
 In the case of the Greeks, he speculates that they “possessed lenses 
adapted for the observation of celestial bodies.” Then further along he 
notes that “Saturn is encircled by two groups of rings—one larger and 
one smaller, with a space in between. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>To see this a better telescope than that used by Galilei or that used by Huygens is needed</em></strong></span>.”
 It is in fact for me to imagine the ancient Greeks (the progeny of Jove
 in their day) possessed such advanced telescopic lenses from a previous
 world age, but I seriously doubt the “aboriginees [sic] of America 
before Columbus discovered the land” or the “Maoris of New Zealand” did.
 Furthermore, there would be physical and documentary evidence of the 
existence of such advanced telescopic lenses had they existed all over 
the world a few thousand years ago and there is no such evidence. It was
 therefore unreasonable for Velikovsky to even suggest this as one 
possible explanation. The only possible explanation, as he says in the 
same paper is that “at some time in the past Saturn and Earth appear to 
have been closer to one another.”</li>
<li><span class="entry">TIMING OF THE ARRIVAL OF LIGHT VERSUS PLASMA OR MOLECULES</span>: This is the crux of the contradiction. Velikovsky theorizes that&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>In the myth it is said that Jupiter drove Saturn away and that 
on this occasion Saturn was put in chains. If these words mean what they
 say and are not a meaningless portion of the myth—in a dream, at least,
 there are no meaningless parts—then the knowledge of the ancients about
 the rings of Saturn could have been acquired because of better 
visibility: in other words, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>at some time in the past Saturn and Earth appear to have been closer to one another</em></strong></span>.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">The light of the seven days was not of
 solar origin. Of what origin was it? Was it caused by brightly 
illuminated clouds of ionized hydrogen, or protons, hurled throughout

 arrived <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>from the present distance of Saturn</strong></span></em>
 in about a week, considering that the proton particles—ionized 
hydrogen—arrive from the sun in the space of twenty-five hours. This is 
the time which elapses from a flare-up on the sun (protuberance) to the 
display of the polar lights—the aurora borealis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">Nowhere in <em>The Light of the Seven Days</em>

<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">Here is the problem. Had such advanced optics existed <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>all over the world</strong></span>,
 there would be some record of this in history. Indeed, I believe such

<h2><span id="What_happened">What happened?</span></h2>
<hr><p>In short what happened is that Proto-Saturn exploded (think <em>“Proto-Saturn goes nova”</em>) in one of the final acts of the end of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/thunderbolts/#the-polar-configuration">polar configuration</a>
 of the planets that so dominated life on Earth before 3100 BC. What 
followed was a profound electromagnetic disturbance throughout the Solar
 System. This resulted in an axial tilt on Earth some 5,000 years ago 
that is remembered to this very day as the <em>biblical deluge</em>. 
What happened though was so much more than Noah’s Flood. It was the 
genesis of the Fifth World in which we now live and which is about to be
 utterly destroyed because the very same electromagnetic disturbance 
that caused Proto-Saturn to explode is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong><a style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/dailies/#the-beginning-of-the-end-the-sun-is-entering-into-a-deep-sleep-right-now">right now</a></strong></em></span></span>
 causing our Sun to become so quiet that galactic cosmic rays and the 
consequential extreme weather will be a part of our life from now until 
the end of the Fifth World a few short years from now. In other words, 
it’s happening all over again.</p>

<p>What is causing this electromagnetic disturbance? It can only be one thing: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/sirius/">Sirius</a>.
 At five different times in our 25,600 year binary dance with this 
gravitational behemoth, the electromagnetic balance in our Solar System 
is profoundly disturbed and the planets are severely impacted. Always 
this involves an axial tilt on Earth with its “wide oceans” that 
effectively wipes the surface of the planet clean and life begins anew. 
This is why humans have no memory. Immanuel Velikovsky referred to it as
 <em>amnesia</em>. I think we live on the only inhabitable planet in what is essentially a <em>defective Solar System</em>, one that is parked way too close to the gravitational behemoth Sirius.</p>
<p>Why is this happening now? What we know are two things. At some time 
in the “recent” past, the Sirius star system and our Solar System were 
at their furthest distance apart in their respective orbits, or what is 
called <em>aphelion,</em> approximately 8.58 light-years. Here I would 
only note that most depictions of these two helical orbits are overly 
simplistic, to put it mildly. Idiotic might be a better term. <em>Elliptical</em> no more describes orbital paths than does <em>circular</em>
 for both fail to take into account the movement of the bodies through 
space at unimaginable speeds. The second thing we know is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/gravity/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>gravity is instantaneous even across vast distances</strong></em></span></a></span> such as this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So
 the change in movement of the Sirius star system away from our Solar 
System to the movement of the two star systems heading towards each 
other is far more significant than people who do not understand gravity 
think</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Contrary to what most people think or imagine, <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">aphelion evidently is far more significant than perihelion in our binary dance with the Sirius star system</span>. </em></strong></p>
<p>This is called the <em>Age of Aquarius</em> because the Sun is reacting to this change by entering into a period of dormancy (or <em>hibernation</em> if you prefer). This aspect of what is happening is discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/dailies/">№ 19. Our last few years on earth (“the beginning of sorrows”)</a>. For the sake of argument, I have aligned my presentation of the Maya Long Count calendar so that the birth of Venus occurs at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/9500bce/">9500 BC</a> when everyone thinks the planet was utterly destroyed. But I created page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/time/">№ 35. The Problem with Time prior to March 23, 687 BC</a> primarily to discuss the problem of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/time/#radiocarbon-dating-to-before-march-23-687-bc">radiocarbon dating</a>
 prior to that date, the last of our close encounters with Mars which 
gave rise to Rome and the God of War. So much thought is given to the 
comet Venus that gave rise to the story of the Exodus that people fail 
to realize our close encounters with Mars were far more destructive. The
 explosion of Proto-Saturn and the close approach of cometary bodies now
 regarded as the planets Venus and Mars completely invalidate the 
assumptions of radiocarbon dating. The truth is that we cannot date <em>anything</em> prior to March 23, 687 BC using this technique. Nothing! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It does not work</span>. In fact, radiocarbon dating prior to this date is worse than useless because people think it actually works.</p>
<p>What is really disturbing is that the ancients and Old Testament 
“prophets” are telling this time will be even more devastating than in 
the past. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Even Christ Jesus says that this time mankind faces extinction</strong></span></em>. What do they know? What does the progeny of Jove know?</p>

<p>I suspect very strongly that the birth of Venus or what is popularly being discussed nowadays as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Younger Dryas impact hypothesis</a>
 is actually the Genesis of the Fourth World circa 8231 BC, the last 
time this happened. (See the Maya Long Count calendar above.) This view 
is roughly supported by the Greenland GISP2 ice core temperatures for 
the last 10,000 years. But then again, I have very little faith in ice 
core temperature records. In the end, knowing what happened involves a 
little common sense. In an electromagnetic universe, what is it that is 
close enough to our Solar System to cause this level of destruction? 
There is only one answer: Sirius. Mainstream science cannot see this 
because they cannot admit that they are mathematically insane and 
everything they think they know is wrong. The electric universe team is 
not willing to ask when exactly Venus was born or Proto-Saturn exploded,
 the two events that undoubtedly are responsible for 9500 BC and 3100 BC
 respectively, because they are preoccupied seeking the respect and 
recognition of the mathematically insane mainstream (or <em>consensus</em>)
 science and academia they themselves have exposed as a modern-day 
version of “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” And so it is left to me (because
 frankly, I know of no one else doing so) to ask the obvious questions 
of, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>If Venus was recently 
“born” from Jupiter (as perhaps are all rocky planets ejected from gas 
giants) and Proto-Saturn recently exploded or went nova, would this not 
have had devastating consequences for our planet?</em></strong></span> And if the answer is <em>Yes</em>, as it must be, then <em>When did these two things happen?</em>
 The answer is obvious, 9500 BC and 3100 BC respectively. And once you 
ask these simple questions, everything starts to fall into place because
 it is obvious that “death from above” would be routine and last for 
hundreds of years after these two rather spectacular events. So for 
example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_Brake" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Watson Brake</a> (3100 BC) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Point" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Poverty Point</a>
 (the comet Venus) are clearly mounds built close to a water supply 
intended to protect their inhabitants from debris falling from the sky. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Builders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mound Builders</a> were just people trying to stay alive</span>. (I am using the term <em>debris</em>
 loosely. No one alive knows what it is like to live on Earth in the 
aftermath of a nearby gas giant ejecting a rocky planet the size of 
Venus or another gas giant going nova, or planet-sized comets bumping up
 against our magnetosphere. It nevertheless happened. And what seems 
obvious to me, given the structures built all over the world during 
these times, is that death rained from the skies for hundreds of years 
afterward.)</p>

 think these catastrophic electromagnetic disturbances to our Solar

destructive forces unleashed when this happens. It is best described in 
the book <em>Cataclysm!: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C.</em> written by D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair. Let us be frank. Most people think I am <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/madman/#batshit-crazy">batshit crazy</a>, but what they <em>do not</em>
 know is just how crazy I really am. I suspect very strongly that what 
is about to happen includes yet another rearrangement of the planets and
 the possible return of the “gods” (the planets so close to Earth that 
they loom large in the sky). I see this in simple plasma experiments 
when a new metal ball is introduced and all of the other little metal 
balls which appeared to be in a very stable arrangement quickly 
reorganize themselves. It is even possible that Saturn will reignite and
 that Earth will have two suns again. Or perhaps Uranus will reignite as
 it was the dominant gas giant before Proto-Saturn.</p>

<p>1. In those days Noah saw that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the earth became inclined</strong></span>, and that destruction approached.<br>2. Then he lifted up his feet, and went to the ends of the earth, to the dwelling of his great-grandfather Enoch.<br>3.
 And Noah cried with a bitter voice, Hear me; hear me; hear me: three 
times. And he said, Tell me what is transacting upon earth; for the 
earth labours, and is violently shaken. Surely I shall perish with it.</p>

 as was not known to the inhabitants before; and God did this mighty 
act, in order to terrify the sons of men, that there might be no more

<hr><p>To “suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune” is one 
thing. To do so without a worthy intellectual pursuit is another. In the
 year 2012, I determined that if I did nothing else in life, I would 
discover what I mistakenly referred to as “3200 BC” and write a book 
with that exact title. As perhaps one of the most abstract thinkers 
alive, I can tell you from many years of experience, one never knows 
when truth will arrive. It is much like a flower which blooms when it 
will. This happens in a day, yet behind this flower is a complex root 
system, stems, and leaves. I possess only the ability to recognize the 
truth when it arrives. And this is more art than fact. In a world of 
opposites, so-called “facts” cannot be trusted. And so on this day, June
 20, 2020, I can announce to the handful of people who may hear my 
voice, I know the day on which the biblical deluge, Noah’s Flood, the 
Genesis flood narrative, or whatever you want to call it, occurred. That
 date was precisely recorded in ancient India and is less precisely 
marked by the Maya Long Count. It was April 20, 3105 BC. Accordingly, I 
have renamed this page.</p>
<p>I will never write that book. Writing books right now is a waste of 
time. Making people pay for this knowledge is a moral crime. And the 
books will all be destroyed in a few short years. Instead, I spend my 
time writing these webpages with the single-minded goal of one day soon 
looking into the eyes of a man who listened and then looking down at his
 son or daughter and knowing I had a purpose in life and a chance to 
live on this planet without all the insanity that surrounds me now.</p>
<p>Back when I began this journey, one of my favorite links was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/what-happened/">What Really Happened in 3100 BC?</a>
 I still recommend this page, which is why I preserve a copy in my ASL 
library. It has been eight years, but little did I know then where I was
 headed.</p>

<h2><span id="The_three_great_witnesses">The three great witnesses</span></h2>
<hr><p>Something unspeakably profound happened around 3100 BC. How do we know this?</p>
<p>I work backward 2160 orbits of Jupiter from December 21, 2018, to the
 start of the calendar in 23,603 BC. This places the start of the last 
Great Cycle at <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3106 BC</strong></span>, which is in perfect agreement with the ancient Yuga Calendar of India. Such an agreement cannot be easily ignored.</p>
<p><strong>It strongly suggests not only that orbits of Jupiter are the 
basic unit of measurement used in the design of the Mesoamerican Long 
Count calendar, but that what I call the “Great Wayeb” was in fact 
intended to obfuscate the actual end date</strong></p>

 thing about the genealogies in Genesis, people give birth and die on 
nice rounded numbers such as Shem who gives birth at 100 and dies at 
600. And in the genealogy of Shem, <em>Shelah, Peleg, and Serug</em> all
 give birth at exactly 130 years old, which is just plain weird. I would
 be remiss if I did not point out that this is emphasizing the number 
13. Of course, I am referring to the original text, not the Hebrew 
Masoretic text (from which Christian Bibles are translated).</p>

<p>The rededication of the Temple by Maccabean forces in 164 BCE is the 
starting date that must be used to work backward in time and make any 
practical use of these genealogies for dating events in history. 
Interestingly, when this Jewish account finally gets to an actual date, 
the numbers no longer round so nicely. The first step backward is the 
374 years between the Edict of Cyrus (538 BCE) and the re-dedication of 
the Temple.
</p>
<p>So what are all these <em>begats</em> really about?
</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One thing I can tell you for 
sure, the Jews are NOT trying to provide a “creation date” for James 
Ussher or any other “Young Earth” Christians</strong></span></p>
<p>Sorry, I have little patience for these people. And I damned sure don’t care if they are offended by anything I say.</p>
<p>The only other major event between the rededication of the temple and
 “creation” is Noah, the biblical Flood. That is what is being encoded 
by the genealogies in Genesis. At the end of Nathan Hoffman’s amazing 
video in the next section, he asks the question,
</p>
<p><strong>Who changed theirs?</strong></p>
<p>“Theirs” is a reference to the Hebrew Masoretic text (from which 
Christian Bibles are translated). The answer to who changed the 
genealogies, erasing 650 years from Genesis is not the question. The 
question is, Why? Why did they change the text? Hoffman thinks he knows 
why, and maybe he is right. But if he is right about the Masoretes 
changing the text so that they could prove that Christ Jesus was not the
 much-awaited Jewish Messiah, they had another, more subtle reason. They
 are hiding the actual date of the biblical Deluge. What they are doing 
is no different than what the designers of the Mesoamerican Long Count 
calendar did when they obfuscated their design and the actual end date. 
There is a little quirk in the text that I think is meant to send a 
message to the reader. Here is the relevant discussion from Wikipedia:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>It seems possible that the period of the Flood is not meant to be 
included in the count—for example, Shem, born 100 years before the 
Flood, “begot” his first son two years after it, which should make him 
102, but Genesis 11:10–11 specifies that he is only 100, suggesting that
 time has been suspended.</p>

</div>
<p>Is this really a mistake? I don’t think so. I think it is comparable 
to the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ending on December 16, 2013, 
five days before the Winter Solstice. I think it is designed to draw 
your attention to what happened in the time of Noah. By the time Nathan 
Hoffman gets done extending biblical Deluge back 650 years from 2350 BC,
 he is at 3000 BC. Not in precise agreement with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/orbits/">Mesoamerican Long Count calendar</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/orbits/#christian-irigaray-and-the-yuga-calendar-of-india">Yuga calendar of India</a>, but close enough that I do not feel the need to try to improve upon his math.</p>

<p>At 16:41 minutes into the video he states,</p>
<div class="quote">“As Velikovsky had stated in an almost offhand manner
 back in mid 1973 Saturn has somehow flared up in NOVA-like brilliance. 
It is unfortunate that Velikovsky misplaced the event in time, placing 
Proto-Saturn’s flareup just ahead of what has come down to us as Noah’s 
deluge, when there is much better evidence for placing it <span style="color: #ff0000;">some 5,000 years earlier</span>
 during that primeval event that lit up the sky for the very first time 
during mankind’s sojourn on Earth. In the book of Genesis, this event 
came to pass when Elohim gave the order to ‘Let there be light.’ But let
 this not be thought of as a unique biblical event. On the contrary, 
this sudden shedding of light into what had been a somewhat darkened 
world is described in various ways in the myth or historical records in 
just about all ancient nations from Mesopotamia and the rest of the Near
 East, India in the Far East including China into Egypt down to Africa, 
Greece and Rome, North America and across the stormy seas to the islands
 in their midst.”</div>
<p>FInish this: The basic thought is that the Festival of the Lights 
could not possibly be so vividly remembered from as long ago as 
8,000-9,000 years ago, Plato does not mention a bright light, and the 
giant skeletons are too close to the surface for Proto-Saturn to have 
gone super nova that long ago. He’s wrong. Velikovsky is right.</p>

<h3><span id="The_Festival_of_the_Lights">The Festival of the Lights</span></h3>
<hr><p>Proto-Saturn really did go nova. Relatively speaking, it happened
 only yesterday, but the progeny of Jove are determined that we not 
learn of our Solar System’s actual history. To do so would be to learn 
that out world is part of a Solar System that is highly prone to 
cataclysms on an unimaginable scale. </p>
<div class="quote">The world was in a dazzling light, sevenfold stronger
 than the light of the sun; the light was so strong and so brilliant day
 and night alike, that the sun was entirely overpowered by it; and in 
the days of Isaiah, thousands of years later, the memory of the light of
 the seven days was vivid in tradition, so that the prophet could refer 
to it in desiring to describe the solar light of the messianic age.<p></p>

</div>
<p>Indeed, 3100 BC would be “thousands of years later,” for <strong>Isaiah</strong> (c. 740-681 BC) who said “The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard”</p>
<p>This is essentially the same “common sense” argument as the giant 
skeletons being found near the surface. The remembrance of the seven 
days of light is so vivid in the memory of peoples all over the world 
that it is difficult to imagine the actual event as having been 
significantly earlier than 3100 BC.</p>

<p>As described by Immanuel Velikovsky, “At a date that I would be hard 
put to task to identify even with approximation, but possibly about than
 [sic] ten thousand years ago, Saturn was disturbed by Jupiter and 
exploded, actually became a nova. The solar system and reaches beyond it
 were illuminated by the exploded star, and in a matter of a week the 
earth was enveloped in waters of Saturnian origin.” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://www.varchive.org/ce/sattot.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.varchive.org/ce/sattot.htm</a>).</p>
<p>At some point during a close approach to Jupiter, Saturn became 
unstable; and, as a result of the influx of extraneous material, it 
exploded, flaring as a nova which, after subsiding, left a remnant that 
the ancients still recognized as Saturn, even though it was but a 
fraction of the celestial body of earlier days. In Saturn’s explosion 
much of the matter absorbed earlier was thrown off into space. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://www.varchive.org/itb/satjup.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.varchive.org/itb/satjup.htm</a></p>

<h3><span id="Giant_skeletons_found_near_the_surface">Giant skeletons found near the surface</span></h3>
<hr><p>The Giant Skeletons are a neutral Issue quote Bible, a different 
race that naturally died out in the new gravity. This tells us nothing 
except that their skeletons are being found near the surface. Primarily 
in North America where erosion could explain depth but their bunkers 
were still on the surface. Conflicting evidence</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Potential Key</strong></span>: Compare depth of skeleton finds to the depth the moai were buried on Easter Island.</p>
<p>The mounds described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://amallulla.com/carl-munck/">Carl Munck’s “The Code”</a>
 were highly accessible underground bunkers occupied by the giants and 
designed to protect them from this intermittent death from the sky. They
 built close to water sources to minimize their time outside during 
these “death from above” events. The fact that their exterior design 
encodes their location was probably little more than what we think of as
 addresses that were useful in tracking who dies and who was still 
alive. Not all of them did survive. In his book <em>The Ancient Giants who Ruled America</em>,
 author Richard J. Dehurst paints a vivid picture of one group of giants
 found huddled in a circle inside their protective mound. They all died 
together. This archeological evidence brings us spitting close to their 
reality.</p>

<p><strong>Proto-Saturn is the planet Saturn when it was our primordial sun before exploding and being removed to a distant orbit</strong>
 (i.e. before it became the planet we know of today). Proto-Saturn was 
much larger than it is today, larger even than Jupiter and it had no

<hr><p>I have elevated this discussion to a separate section because I 
have been attacked more than once for using the word “explode” to 
explain what happened to Saturn. And no less than Jno Cook, for whom I 
have great respect, has vehemently questioned my linking of the fourteen
 pieces of Osiris to the aftermath of that explosion. Yet the following 
quote is from was written by a man to whom I think we should all pay 
homage, for without him we would not know anything about the real 
history of our solar system:</p>
<div class="quote"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Saturn exploded</strong></span>
 and caused the Earth to go through the greatest of its historical 
catastrophes, and this was completely sufficient to make of Saturn the 
supreme deity; but it appears that the Age of Saturn is a name for the 
epoch <i>before</i> the Deluge; after the Deluge Saturn, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">dismembered</span></strong>, almost ceased to exist as a planetary body and when at length it was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>reconstituted</strong></span>
 it was fettered by rings, and was far from being the dominant celestial
 body that would behoove it as the supreme deity of the epoch.<p></p>

<p>Velikovsky in not unacquainted with the term <em>nova</em>. He 
article entitled simply Nova seems designed to emphasis this fact and to
 show how “normal” novas should not be confused with what happened 
immediately prior to and during the biblical deluge. Yet he 
characterizes what happened as an explosion. Perhaps, as Velikovsky 
suggests, what “exploded” was the water (as opposed to the light of a 
nova).</p>
<p>Does not this sound like the Osiris myth? And, even if it sounds to 
our modern sensibilities outlandish, should we not allow ourselves to be
 informed as to what happened by the eyewitnesses? Elsewhere he says:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>On becoming a nova, it ejected filaments in all directions and the 
solar system became illuminated as if by a hundred suns. It subsided 
rather quickly and retreated into far-away regions.</p>
<p class="citation">Immanuel Velikovsky, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190206/https://www.varchive.org/itb/satjup.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Saturn and Jupiter</em></a></p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps this close to Earth, the filaments were visible. Or perhaps 
they were Saturn’s asteroids and comets. Whatever it was, water, 
filaments, asteroids, or comets, Saturn appeared to have <em>exploded</em> before it went nova. I stand behind my use of the word.</p>
<p>What caused the explosion? Here is what Immanuel Velikovsky says:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>As told, the picture that emerges from comparative folklore and 
mythology presents Saturn and Jupiter in vigorous interactions. Suppose 
that these two bodies approached each other rather closely at one time, 
causing violent perturbations and huge tidal effects in each other’s 
atmospheres. Their mutual disturbance led to a stellar explosion, or 
nova. As we have seen, a nova is thought to result from an instability 
in a star, generated by a sudden influx of matter, usually derived from 
its companion in a binary system. If what we call today Jupiter and 
Saturn are the products of such a sequence of events, their appearance 
and respective masses must formerly have been quite different. </p>
<p>A scenario such as this would explain the prominence of Saturn prior 
to its cataclysmic disruption and dismemberment—it must have been a 
larger body than it is now, possibly of the volume of Jupiter. 
Interestingly, for certain reasons G. Kuiper assumed that Saturn 
originally was of a mass equal to that of Jupiter. At some point during a
 close approach to Jupiter, Saturn became unstable; and, as a result of 
the influx of extraneous material, it exploded, flaring as a nova which,
 after subsiding, left a remnant that the ancients still recognized as 
Saturn, even though it was but a fraction of the celestial body of 
earlier days. In Saturn’s explosion much of the matter absorbed earlier 
was thrown off into space. Saturn was greatly reduced in size and 
removed to a distant orbit—the binary system was broken up and Jupiter 
took over the dominant position in the sky. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Saturn could be removed only by the planet Jupiter, the sole member 
of the planetary family more powerful than Saturn. And indeed, the myth 
says that Saturn was removed by Jupiter.

</li></ol><p>Notice that I have said nothing about Proto-Saturn “encountering” or being “captured” by the sun.</p>
<p>I profoundly disagree with Wallace Thornhill and the electric universe school of thought; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Proto-Saturn was not “captured” by the Sun</strong></span>.
 Mankind did not live in relative darkness for countless generations. 
The Zodiac and the Mesoamerican calendars argue against this 
possibility. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The implications of this are nothing less than mind-boggling</strong></span>.</p>
<p>I will return to these “implications” momentarily. But first, it is 
imperative to address the electric universe’s notion that Proto-Saturn 
was “captured” by the sun. From the moment I first heard I thought to 
myself, “This new crop of thinkers can make mistakes as grand as the 
last.” I fear the reason for this is something buried deep in the human 
psyche. We insist on being originators. We lack the imagination to place
 ourselves in what would seem to us to be an infinitely long 
progression. In short, everything must be recent. It is a sort of deeply
 ingrained egotism.</p>
<p><strong>The very same </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>essentially narcissistic </strong></span><strong>thought that gave rise to the idea of a </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Big Bang</strong></span><strong> would now have us believe that</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Proto-Saturn was “captured” by the sun </strong></span><strong>and
 that the change from the polar configuration to the present arrangment 
of the planets is the first time our solar system has ever reconfigured 
itself in response to extrasolar electromagnetic forces such as our 
binary dance with the Sirius star system</strong></p>
<p>If we can interpret myth why can we not simply listen to what the 
ancients are telling us? This has happened before. It will happen again.
 The Mayans referred to it as a “Great Cycle” every 432 orbits of 
Jupiter. Every 2160 orbits of Jupiter something even more spectacular 
happens. The ancient Greeks called it the “Ekpyrosis”</p>
<p>When in the polar configuration as opposed to the present 
configuration of the planets, there are two suns. Wallace Thornhill says
 this much in the very same video from which the above image was taken. 
At <span class="s1"><strong>2:15</strong> minutes into the video he says”</span></p>
<p>“In my home in Australia, the original inhabitants have legends of a time when there were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>two suns</strong></span>, a greater and a lesser sun” —Wallace Thornhill</p>
<p>Here is the critical question:</p>
<p>If the polar configuration survived for what must have been hundreds 
if not thousands of years within the sun’s heliosphere, on what basis 
does the electric universe school of thought rule out the possibility 
that the polar configuration is not normal for our solar system. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Why do they assume it could have been only short-lived and that Proto-Saturn must have been “captured” by the sun?</strong></span></p>

<p>The following video discusses Earth’s supposed “capture” by the Sun. 
There must be another reason for the flare-up, such as a galactic 
superwave (at the start he says Thornhill addresses the same topic in

<p>I find this to be an absurd notion. The ice core temperature record does not support this, neither does Immanuel Velikovsky:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>If there is truth in the surmise, and nothing more it is than a 
surmise, that the Earth was once a satellite of Saturn, the latter must 
have revolved closer to the sun in order that the Earth should receive 
heat from it—Saturn exudes little heat—and if the age of Kronos was a 
golden age, then it is also proper to assume that the conditions on the 
satellite Earth were not unfavorable for life.</p>

</div>
<p>I have serious misgivings about Jergens’ theory that Proto-Saturn 
flared because the polar configuration was “captured” by the Sun. Who am
 I to fault the EU team, but I find this absurd. Whatever happened in 
the 9500 BC timeframe interrupted a 100,000 year, heartbeat-like 
temperature cycle right as it was approaching an interglacial peak. The 
ice cores tell us that Earth’s Holocene temperature record thereafter is
 only two degrees centigrade off the peak it never reached and <em>only eight degrees centigrade (14.4° Fahrenheit) warmer than the lowest recorded temperatures over the past 400,000 years. </em></p>
<p>Common sense is lacking here. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How
 can you add a yellow dwarf (the Sun) into the equation and only end up 
with an eight-degree centigrade difference in temperature? That defies 
logic.</strong></span> Whatever caused Proto-Saturn to flare must be something else, such as one of LaViolette’s galactic superwaves.</p>
<p>Now look at the ice core temperature record for this planet:</p>

<p>Earth stabilizes within a few centigrades of the so-called 
“interglacial” (another subject) peaks of the previous solar system 
configuration. <strong>The new temperature norm is so close to the old range that I cannot agree that Proto-Saturn was “captured” by the Sun</strong>.
 The Sun has always been at the center of the solar system. This is the 
message of there being 144 Jose solar cycles in the Mesoamerican 
(misnamed “Mayan”) Long Count calendar.</p>

<hr><p>Earth has two pasts now. One is gone and will never return. That 
was the world spoken of by David Talbott in which Proto-Saturn was our 
primary Sun. This has profound implications for the correct 
interpretation of our planet’s temperature record. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Most import of all is that the</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Milankovitch Cycles cannot be projected back in time to explain glaciation</span></strong>. As another example, the following quote from Wikipedia is<strong> completely meaningless</strong>
 when you stop to consider that 400,000 years ago Earth was part of the 
polar configuration. Why? Because Earth was on a completely different 
orbital path. So the “orbital parameters” 400,000 years ago were 
completely different. Everything was.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>The interglacial 400 kyr ago, which is believed (from arguments about
 the configuration of the orbital parameters of the earth) to be an 
approximate analogue to the current interglacial, was quite long: 28 
kyr. The Nature paper argues that if this analogue is accepted, the 
current climate would be expected to continue like today’s, in the 
absence of human influence (which it states is unlikely, given the 
predicted increases in greenhouse gas concentrations).</p>

<p><strong>If it were</strong> <strong>not for the Book of Enoch</strong>, we would <strong>not have any Hebrew textual or scriptural precedent</strong> for <strong>many of the apocalyptic phrases</strong> in the <strong>John’s Apocalypse of Revelation</strong>. <strong>So when</strong> the <strong>days of the coming of the Messiah</strong> are <strong>foretold,</strong> let us look at what <strong>happened to this planet earth as stated in the Book of Enoch.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Book of Enoch – “In those days, Noah saw that the earth became inclined, and that destruction</strong><strong> approached.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>According</strong> to the <strong>Book of Enoch</strong>, <strong>just before the flood of Noah,</strong>this <strong>planet earth tilted on its axis</strong> or as the <strong>text says</strong>, it <strong>“became inclined.”</strong> Compare this <strong>text with another Hebrew book</strong>, also not found in the <strong>Biblical canon</strong> but was <strong>quoted from in the Old Testament. This book</strong> was called the <strong>Megillah (Scroll) of Yashir (Jasher) </strong>and<strong> compared its description </strong>with the<strong> Book of Revelation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jasher 6:1</strong> – <strong>“And on</strong> that <strong>day (Flood), the Lord caused</strong>the <strong>whole earth to shake</strong>, and the <strong>sun darkened</strong>, and the <strong>foundations of the world rages</strong>, and the <strong>whole earth was moved violently</strong>, and the <strong>lightning flashed</strong> and <strong>the thunder roared,</strong> and all the <strong>fountains in the earth were broken up</strong>….”</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 12-14 – “I looked when He opened the sixth seal,</strong> and <strong>behold</strong>, there was a <strong>great earthquake; </strong>and the <strong>sun became black as sackcloth of hair,</strong> and the <strong>moon became like blood,</strong> and the <strong>stars of heaven fell to the earth,</strong> as a <strong>fig tree drops its late figs</strong> when it is <strong>shaken by a mighty wind. Then the sky receded</strong> as a <strong>scroll when it is rolled up,</strong> and <strong>every mountain and island</strong> was <strong>moved out of its place</strong><strong>.”</strong></p>

<p>Thanks Catherine. I have a copy of <em>Forgotten Civilization: The Role of Solar Outbursts in Our Past and Present</em>
 and have added it to my read list for solving this problem. The thing 
that is exciting about “solar flare” resources is that they potentially 
support a local nova such as Proto-Saturn exploding, I would especially 
say this about the Paul A LaViolette resource Joshua Roberts provided 
(above). I very seriously doubt that either he or Schoch have considered
 that their physical evidence could be traced back to an explosion of 
Proto-Saturn rather than a superflare coming from our current Sun.</p>
