<p class="page-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PAGE STATUS</strong></span>:
 I removed the discussion of the progeny of Jove from the homepage to 
the start of this page. Consequently I need to merge the first two 
sections after the brief introduction. They are doubtless highly 
repetitive. On the whole, this page has been in bad need of a rewrite 
for a couple of years now.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: December 22, 2021</p>

 up are Sir Francis Bacon and his entourage who steal the Ћinkers stage 
so-to-speak, first in the Globe Theatre and then as a road act in 1616 
when they founded the <em>historical</em> Rosicrucians and again a 
hundred years later in 1717 when the more public Freemasons were 
founded. We loosely refer to these as <em>secret</em> societies but only lately have I learned proper respect for that term. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>These guys are really, really good at keeping secrets.</strong></em></span>
 Imagine me the day after looking out from my hilltop retreat in awe, 
and trust me to have the correct perspective when I say—over 400 years 
later—their impact on the daily lives of people in the United States of 
America is incalculable. It is the Freemasons who erected the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> monument in <em><strong>1980</strong></em>, The “Apocalyptic Pillar” (a popular name I condone) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/cathedral/">Cathedral of St. John the Divine</a> in <em><strong>1997</strong></em>, had something to do with the declassification of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/thomas/">The Adam and Eve Story</a></em> in <em><strong>2013</strong></em>, and that same year began filming of Walt Disney Pictures’ <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">Tomorrowland</a></em> (released in <strong><em>2015</em></strong>) marking the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the Rosicrucians. And finally, <em>The Walk</em>
 later that same year. I think it is safe to say the 35 years that 
separate the first and last of these end-times warnings is a salute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://glofga.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grand Lodge of Georgia, F. &amp; A.M.</a>, which was founded in 1735. Better men have not trod this globe since the Bard and Nazarene. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And they walk amongst us now.</em></strong></span> To them, I pledge my allegiance. Their time has come. This is a virtual <em>fireworks finale</em> of thinly veiled, <strong><em>end-time warning messages</em></strong>. But as the Ћinkers all but admit in the speech by Governor David “Nix” featured at the top of page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">№ 22. Walt Disney Pictures’ Tomorrowland movie: Final notice for the masses</a>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>no one is listening.</em></strong></span> And the reason for this is that the people’s minds <em>and bodies</em> have been <em>desecrated</em>
 (for lack of a better word) ever since the bankers took control of the 
United States of American after the so-call Civil War. They need to be 
told in plain English what is happening. As for non-English speakers, I 
cannot reach them. There is no time for translations and even if there 
were, this site is so dynamic that translations are not possible in the 
timeframe permitted me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span id="Brief_Introduction">Brief Introduction</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">This page more or less continues where page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/crete/">№ 8. Origins of the Progeny of Jove</a>
 leaves off. It attempts to describe the progeny of Jove from the 
founding of the Knights Templar to the present day. However, at the 
moment this is one of the most messed up pages on the website. All I 
have ever done for over two years now is dump stuff here. I will be 
completely rewriting it in the near future. One of the lessons I have 
learned, which to me now seems obvious but nonetheless took years to 
realize, is the bankers don’t make movies. They don’t pay homage to 
Queen Elizabeth I. They generally do not do anything except prepare for 
what is coming and kill anyone who gets in their way. However, they are 
the progeny of Jove, and they do worship numbers. So they do numerically
 sign their work throughout history, but otherwise, <em>they generally do not communicate to the public</em>
 who they regard as the walking dead. This is why there is a numeric 
signature on the design of the original World Trade Center. It is 
the&nbsp;Ћinkers who make movies and express themselves in art and 
architecture. Their entire raison d’être is to warn the public about the
 coming Earth crustal displacement.&nbsp;This may seem a small 
difference to you at the moment, but I assure you this observation is of
 immense importance if you want to understand what is happening all 
around you even to this very day.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span id="The_progeny_of_Jove">The progeny of Jove</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">The term <em>progeny of Jove</em>,—borrowed from Virgil’s <em>Eclogue IV</em>
 at top of this page,—refers to people who have specific knowledge about
 the end time. There are primarily two factions. One is the Old World 
bankers who took control of this country in the so-called Civil War. The
 other is an even more fascinating story that involves no less than the 
man you know as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright not the actor) and the two secret societies he and his followers founded. Those are the <em>historical</em> Rosicrucians and the Freemasons in the South.</p>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" class="intro">Three factions</div>
<ul><li><span class="entry">The Bankers</span>: They began life as the 
Roman elite and after the fall of the Roman Empire resurfaced as the 
Knights Templar,—the original Old World bankers. Of all three factions, 
their lineage is the most direct and as such is somewhat defined by 
bloodlines. The bankers have only ever become richer and more powerful 
through the centuries.</li>
<li><span class="entry">The Ћinkers</span>: While there is indeed a long
 tradition of Ћinkers which can be rightly said to date back to the 
ancient Greeks and most definitely includes the papal architects and 
alchemists, on this website the term <em>Ћinkers</em> primarily refers 
to a very special group of men led by one man who you know of as William
 Shakespeare (the playwright, not the actor) in Elizabethan England over
 400 years ago now. His real name was&nbsp;Sir Francis Bacon. They 
started the historical Rosicrucians and the Freemasons who founded the 
United States of America. Their continuity from the time of the 
Rosicrucian manifestos through to the Civil War was unbroken <em>but defined by the character of the men, not bloodlines</em>.
 A dedicated remnant of the Ћinkers is responsible for all of the 
end-time warnings people have been ignoring for years now, including the
 all-important Georgia Guidestones and a slew of movies including <em>The Black Hole</em>, <em>Virus</em> (1980), <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>Tomorrowland,</em> and <em>The Walk </em>discussed below. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They have been trying to warn us about the coming Earth crustal displacement for over 400 years now.</em></strong></span> No one listened to them either. The <span class="entry">Ћinkers</span> identify themselves in one of three ways; with the more subtle number <strong><em>55</em></strong>, with the number <em>58</em> when paying homage to Sir Francis Bacon’s mother, Queen Elizabeth I, and with the initials <strong><em>MM</em></strong>, which corresponds to 13 13 in simple English gematria, in matters regarding the Georgia Guidestones and the Stone of Destiny.</li>
<li><span class="entry">The Jesuits and Black Pope</span>: Originally, 
the Jesuits were the bankers taking control of the church apparatus in 
Rome as payback for the papal bull Vox in excelso. However, once in 
control of the Roman Catholic Church, the Jesuits and Black Pope became 
something so ugly that the bankers eventually had to reassert themselves
 to regain control of a world increasingly enslaved by the Roman 
Catholic Church. They could conceive of nothing more than a world in 
which they knew everything and everyone else was hopelessly ignorant of 
the truth. They had no loyalties outside of Rome. For this reason, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the Jesuits and Black Pope are regarded as a third faction within the progeny of Jove</em></strong></span>. The Ћinkers were born fighting the Roman Catholic Church in Elizabethan England. Were it not for the resistance of both <em>the bankers and the Ћinkers</em>, the whole world may have become as lost as is Central and South America today. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>For this, we owe them a debt of gratitude.</em></span></strong>
 According to no less than Abraham Lincoln, the Jesuits played a part in
 instigating the Civil War, but beyond that, they do not seem to be of 
any great consequence. They do own one of the most special libraries on 
the planet. We can only hope they have taken measures to assure the 
survival of those manuscripts and books.&nbsp;</li>

<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" class="intro">The bankers are oblivious to what the Ћinkers are doing</div>
<p>Here I want to say something I’ve never said before. The longer I 
study these two groups of men, the more sure I become that their 
relationship is not unlike the Ћinkers and the Jesuits during the time 
in which the cathedrals were built. Here it is important to realize that
 the Jesuits <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>are</em></strong></span> the bankers. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Medici family</a> are consummate bankers. The first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes_from_the_Medici_family" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Medici Pope</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pope Leo X</a>.
 He was ordained priest on 15 March 1513. Two days later he was 
consecrated as bishop. And in what I can only speculate may be yet 
another reference to 2022, two days later again on the 19th of March, 
1513, he was crowned Pope. The Jesuits were then founded on August 15, 
1534, and have been in control of the Roman Catholic Church ever 
since.&nbsp;The Ћinkers—more specifically, the architects for the 
papacy—were used to get inside the church <em>at the very same time the symbolism on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_cathedrals_and_churches" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gothic cathedrals</a> was a mockery of Catholicism</em>. The bankers had no idea what was happening. As you will see in the following section about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Paper_Company" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Scott Paper Company</a>, founded in the Ohio River Valley, where the bankers were before Colorado (as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/presidents/">№ 51. Freemason Presidents and the Ohio River Valley</a>), this obliviousness on the part of the bankers has never stopped. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I do not mean to imply that they are stupid. They are just too busy to notice what is happening.</em></strong></span>
 Where the bankers I think would take action if they knew any better is 
that the Ћinkers always have “a man on the inside.” They always have 
detailed foreknowledge of anything the bankers are planning to do. That 
was true when the gothic cathedrals were built and it was true all 
during the planning of 9/11 and Covid-19. However, with the notable 
exception of the rather in-your-face Georgia Guidestones for which they 
provided a credible cover story—one the whole world bought into—the 
Ћinkers are always mindful to not be too obvious. Were it otherwise, I 
would not put it past the bankers to burn down Atlanta a second time.</p>
<p>I think an appreciable percentage of what I discuss on this website 
was never intended for the public, and especially not for the bankers. 
If that is so, it may explain why my website has not been shut down. And
 here is what I want to say, it may also explain why the Ћinkers will 
not acknoledge my work, and may in fact be hindering me. As I have said 
elsewhere on this website, I sent my full name and contact information 
to every Royal Arch Freemason lodge in the South. I did so because I do 
not like the feeling that I am hiding from anyone. I am not. The only 
reason this website does not have my name on it is because I don’t want 
the hassle of unwanted phone calls and emails, not to mention the 
possibility of a visit to my house.&nbsp;</p>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" class="intro">Commonalities</div>
<p>The bankers and the Ћinkers share two things in common. One is 
that—in what might be described as a Pythagorian tradition—they worship 
numbers and therefore share a common compulsion to numerically sign 
their work. This is their greatest weakness and how I have learned most 
of what I know about them. The other is that they make movies, but for 
completely different reasons. The bankers make movies for the purpose of
 molding the thought of the masses. None come more readily to mind than <em>2001: A Space Odessy</em>
 which prepared an unsuspecting public for Moon landings that never 
occurred. Now they seem to be preparing us for a viral pandemic much 
more serious than COVID-19. This is sometimes referred to as <em>predictive programming</em>.
 The Ћinkers make movies for the sole purpose of trying to 
enlighten,—not the general public,—but their own, what they call the <em>initiated</em>.
 I eavesdrop on those communications. Primarily what this means is 
telling us who is responsible for 9/11 and what exactly is about to 
happen. For example, because of these not-so-well-hidden communications,
 we know what to expect is an Earth crustal displacement most probably 
in the year 2022. And we know who is responsible for 9/11. Why? Why is 
“9/11” so important? Because 9/11 is to the bankers what the Georgia 
Guidestones and <em>Tomorrowland</em> are to the Ћinkers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are all what I like to think of as end-time markers.</em></strong></span>
 It’s not a blame game the Ћinkers are playing. They are trying to show 
us the big picture. They want us to think about why these things are 
happening. As I said above, men do not do the things such as destroying 
the World Trade Center with advanced directed energy weapons unless the 
destruction about to be visited on this planet is imminent.&nbsp;That is
 the overarching message of the Georgia Guidestones and in all of the 
movies made by the Ћinkers.</p>

<p>This is not a “deep state.” <em>The concept of a “deep state” wants for imagination.</em>
 This is a cabal of men who in the end time are now hiding behind 
need-to-know clearances and who are in control of the entire Western 
world. We don’t know who they are. We never will. Not even the president
 of the United States of America has a clue who these guys are. I am

 movie, did so because they wanted to artistically convey the reality of
 what I discuss on this website. Over a period of 700 years since the 
Vox in excelso was issued, the progeny of Jove have perfected hiding 
from the public. And many <em>if not most</em> of them live in Colorado <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>because

<hr><p><span style="font-size: 36px;">The progeny of Jove have used 
different organizational entities throughout the ages to move stealthily
 through time. They believe themselves destined to repopulate the earth 
anew after the coming apocalypse. Over a period of more than 2,600 
years, they have systematically eliminated anyone else who possessed 
specific knowledge of the end times. And by this, I do not mean to say 
only the druids, Jewish kabbalists, ancient Egyptians, Arabs, and Indian
 mystics, but the Elongated Skulls in South America and the Maya priests
 in Central America, too. And the evidence that they annihilated a 
once-thriving population in North America in order to preserve this as <em>The Land of the End Times</em>
 is positively overwhelming. The genocide of American “Indians” was 
merely a mopping-up operation. The date is January 29, 2021, and only 
last night I discovered amazing new evidence the Knights Templar fleet 
did not disappear. That would be like waking up one morning to discover 
the entire United States Navy had disappeared. It simply is not 
possible. They sailed for the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">They are ruthless and uncanny. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Untold millions of individuals have died as a consequence of their relentless march towards the “New World.”</strong></span></em>
 If you want to understand them, stop reading this and watch the Walt 
Disney Pictures movie “Tomorrowland.” That is their movie. That is what 
they are fighting for.</span></p>

<p>The people Virgil refers to as the “progeny of Jove” (a term I adopt 
throughout this website) are a peculiar people. In return for being part
 of the Brotherhood, they dedicate their lives to a multigenerational 
plan that,—for most of them at least, historically speaking,—will not 
come to fruition until sometime in the distant future. Anyone of them 
alive now will benefit from this plan, but their predecessors did what 
they did out of an altruistic sense of hope for the survival of 
mankind,—<em>with all of its knowledge and technology from this world intact</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are alive and well</em></strong></span>, even as the six lines of Virgil’s <em>Eclogue IV</em>
 at the top of my homepage very clearly assumes would be the case. They 
have been known by many different names throughout history and date as 
far back as the ancient Greeks and Old Testament <em>so-called</em> 
prophets. After abandoning Greece, they became the Roman elite, ruling 
classes. One of the last of the known Roman progeny of Jove was 
Constantine the Great. After the fall of Rome, their whereabouts become 
uncertain, but this website <em>speculates</em> that they largely abandoned Europe for the Americas.</p>
<p>They resurface in the historical record as the Knights Templar. But 
the maniacal attack on the Knights Templar by a petty and historically 
inconsequential man history knows as Philip IV taught them a valuable 
lesson. In the intervening years since then, they have <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>morphed from one organizational entity to another</strong></span></em>. This is how they hide their identity, maintain secrecy, and move stealthily down through the centuries.</p>
<p>In the relatively recent past in the United States, you have known them as the, and <em>European Illuminati, Freemasons, and CIA</em>.
 As an organizational entity, the European Illuminati existed only a 
brief period of time in the United States because the first thing they 
did was to infiltrate the Scottish Rite Freemasons in order to create 
the Northern Jurisdiction which they then controlled from the Ohio River
 Valley. However, the term <em>European Illuminati</em> is a 
historically accurate description of the people who eventually “won the 
game” and are in control of all of the end-time infrastructure in 
Colorado. They are extensively discussed on two separate pages: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">№ 11. The centuries-old War between the Bankers and Purveyors of Wisdom</a>; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/central/">№ 12. The Rothschilds, Federal Reserve System, and the Wizards of Fiat Currency</a>. The Illuminati are all about wealth, (worldly) knowledge, and power. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In short, they are control freaks.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>They presently exist primarily in the United States of America 
well-hidden behind need-to-know clearances that exclude even sitting 
presidents. In other words, right now in the end times, after millennia 
of practice, they have perfected the art of hiding themselves from the 
public and consequently have no name. Hence, I refer to them as the <em>Unknown Entity</em> throughout this website when speaking about them in the present.</p>
<p>They are in direct control of the government and military of this 
country, mainstream media (MSM), and all major corporations. Through the
 power of fiat currency, large corporations, and the inherent weakness 
of the Republic form of government they invented in ancient Greece, 
which is to say the corruptibility of political leaders, and their own 
members in other countries, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>they in fact control the entire Western world</em></strong></span>.
 Where I differ from others in this regard is that I can trace their 
origins back 2,600 years to the Minoan culture on the isle of Crete. 
This cabal of men is the equivalent of the intelligent machines 
responsible for the computer-simulated reality in which the mass of 
humanity lives in the Matrix movie.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">The secret societies, including all their arcane and esoteric symbolism, and CIA are a thing of the past</span></em></strong>.
 Right now, in the end-time, the progeny of Jove are well-hidden behind 
need-to-know clearances that exclude even the sitting President of the 
United States of America. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>In other words, they have perfected the art of hiding themselves from public scrutiny.</strong> </em></span>The
 progeny of Jove not only control the military and government of the 
United States of America, but through the power of fiat currency, major 
corporations, and the Republic form of government they invented (knowing
 the politicians would be easily corrupted and thereby controlled), <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>they control the entire Western world.</strong></em></span></p>

 there were others, to be sure. First among them are the Phrygians, who

explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">The good is the ancient greeks dating 
back to an antediluvian people on the island of Crete, home of Zeus. 
Their counterparts do not appear until the Greeks began migrating to 
Italy in earnest. So this little tale is afoot. Let me tell you 
something about the purveyors of knowledge, they began life as the 
Pythagoreans for sure, but this was in a different world than ours when 
the Romans were consuming everything Greek with rapacious delight. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Control enters the stage quietly at first as a Roman shopping spree.</em></strong></span> </span></p>

pretending to be knights in shining armor. More recently, this same 
baker faction of the progeny of Jove were known as the </span><span style="font-size: 36px;">Northern
 Jurisdiction of Freemasonry (which at the time was controlled by the 
European Illuminati in the Ohio River) until 1947 when they morphed into
 CIA and finally—their last move in 1977 to Colorado and what I call the
 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Unnamed Entity well-hidden behind need-to-know clearances</em></strong></span><em>.</em> (The latter is spellbinding the more you think of it.

<p class="wp-block-pdfemb-pdf-embedder-viewer"></p>
<p>These are the bad guys, but not because their cause is not noble and well planned, but because <em>we are the walking dead to them</em>.
 Our lives are inconsequential to them. They are so morally deformed 
that doing something that proves this, such as rapping and murdering 
children, is a right of passage for at least some of them. My work on 
page&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/pedophilia/">№ 106. Rampant pedophilia is being used to control everyone in power</a>
 proved this to me beyond any shadow of a doubt. By the way, writing 
that page was one of the hardest things I’ve done my whole life. It is a
 world so lost to anything resembling common humanity that I still 
recoil at the thought of it. Included in this group are the psychopaths,
 inbred family lines that have lost any sense of compassion for their 
fellow human beings <em>whatsoever</em>. They, I go so far as to argue, 
are not even the same species. They have lost something they cannot get 
back. Nevertheless, my argument with the control freaks is not that they
 are evil. That is nonsense. The stakes in this game are indeed high 
enough to justify some loss of life before the Earth crustal 
displacement. They got a good plan for surviving it, quite possibly one 
of the best ever. If it succeeds, the truth is our lives were 
inconsequential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my heart is with the Bard. It has been ever since I realized 
everyone had missed the true meaning of “The Temple of the Rose Cross” 
by Daniel Mögling,—that it is the Globe Theatre on wheels. But realizing
 that was nothing compared to what happened after I noticed Noah’s Ark. 
No one has ever come close to correctly interpreting this drawing. The 
mirror image for Noah’s Ark is Sir Francis Bacon casting himself off of a
 cliff. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What does that symbolize?</em></strong></span>
 That’s the beauty of it.&nbsp; No one even saw it. Okay, so what we can
 deduce is that the man doing the jumping is about to die.</p>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" class="impact-216-red">Time is short.</div>
<p>That is the essence of what the mirror image of Noah’s Ark signifies.
 But there is a more subtle meaning. Bacon is launching himself into the
 future, albeit for him that’s a short trip. The drawing wants you to 
acknowledge his mortality. This is how Bacon says, “I am projecting 
myself into the future.” <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The jump is everything in that sense.</em></strong></span> The Rosicrucians were tasked with completing the Great Work. <em>How do they differ from the Freemasons?</em> In the simplest possible terms, the Freemasons were—(and here <em>I want to emphasize the past tense</em>)—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the public arm of the Rosicrucians</em></strong></span>.
 I really think that is the best way to understand the relationship 
between these two secret societies. They are different names for the 
Ћinkers in Elizabethan England. Think of them as a single entity. 
Abraham Lincoln makes it clear they had a vibrant relationship right up 
until the start of the Civil War. After that, and perhaps by way of 
apology, the <em>historical</em> Rosicrucians disappear from the stage of history as quietly as they appeared over 400 years ago. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Never to be seen again</em></strong></span>, if you get my drift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that’s not entirely true. I am still relatively new to this 
subject. I need more time, but let me say this much,—I am at least 
contemplating a reality in which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">Tomorrowland</a>
 were the Bard’s end game. It makes sense to me. These are the people 
who feel compassion for us. These are the secret societies tasked by the
 Bard himself to carry out a Great Work. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Dignity is what differentiates them from the Old World bankers.</em></strong></span> It’s a question of <em>what you do with what you know</em>,
 and do the people deserve at least a warning. The answer to this 
question involves a self-fulfilling prophecy. To tell the people now is 
madness. But it did not have to be this way.&nbsp;</p>

have a hard time imagining what they were thinking.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Sick beyond words.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I 
can continue, allow me to address the question of how long has the 
progeny of Jove been in control of the Roman Catholic church. For me, 
this question actually begins with the Hebrew Bible (or <em>Tanakh</em>)
 because what we are talking about here is the ability of the progeny of
 Jove with their mind-boggling, multi-generational planning to 
infiltrate and populate the highest offices in major religions with 
their own people. Here I am going to suggest that the Jews did not 
change their genealogy. I believe it was changed for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this so important? It speaks volumes if the genealogy of 
genesis has been deliberately changed because it is being used to track 
the time that has passed since Proto-Saturn exploded. Now,—listen 
carefully,—that makes the genealogy of genesis one of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/genesis/#The_three_great_witnesses">three great witnesses</a></em> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/genesis/">№ 38. The explosion of Proto-Saturn on April 20, 3105 BC, and the subsequent biblical deluge</a>.
 It’s a clock. A Jewish clock. And someone moved the hour-hand some 600 
years backward, a stunt not unlike December 21, 2012. If you ask me the 
Jews would not change their sacred texts out of concern that the 
disciples of the Nazarene were going to take over leadership of their 
religion and put them out of a job. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Doesn’t that sound a little far fetched to you?</em></strong></span> There is only one organization with the wherewithal to accomplish something like this—and it is <em>the progeny of Jove</em>.</p>

<p>So what if the Jews are using the genealogy of genesis as a&nbsp; 
doomsday clock because they know something,—an unbelievably huge natural
 disaster of some sort, —is going to happen about a thousand years into 
the future. What happens if you change their doomsday clock? <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They die.</strong></span> </em>So isn’t it more likely that an enemy changed this clock? You can read about this change at v</p>

</div>
<p>So to be clear, what I am saying is that I do not think the Jews 
would change their sacred texts because they felt threatened by the 
status of the Nazarene in the nascent Christian religion. That makes 
absolutely no sense to me. What does make sense is that by this time, 
the progeny of Jove have been around for over a millennium. We know they
 are in Babylonia, and “Jews” there are participating in the rewrite. I 
would also suggest to you that this infiltration of the Jewish religion 
is the origin of the statement in Revelation 2:9, “I know thy works, and
 tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and&nbsp;<i>I know</i>&nbsp;the blasphemy of them <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>which say they are Jews, and are not, but&nbsp;are the synagogue of Satan</strong></em></span>.” Here you must recall that <em>The Revelation</em>
 was written by the progeny of Jove and Satan is Saturn. I think they 
are just self-identifying in this highly unusual sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is clear that the progeny of Jove infiltrated the Jewish 
religion around the time of Antiochus Epiphanes (216 to 164 BC) when The
 Book of Daniel is written and again when the Masoretic Text was written
 in order to change the dates in the genealogy of Genesis. This is a 
period of hundreds of years. The same thing is happening in the 
Christian religion. Emperor Constantine planted <em>The Revelation</em> 
in the Bible and many hundreds of years later the progeny of Jove deem 
the Christian Church too much of a threat and take control of it through
 the Jesuits and Black Pope. This is what they do and they can do it for
 the simple reason that no one suspects multigenerational planning and 
the taking over of an organization through very long periods of time. 
Rather than seeing it as something no one could do, I see it as routine 
for the progeny of Jove. They’ve been doing this for over two thousand 
years now. Given the numbering of The Book of Daniel and The Revelation 
and a long list of other things such as Nebuchadnezzar containing a 
disguised reference to Antiochus Epiphanes, I would go as far as to say <em>they are making very little effort to hide what they have done</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of these three factions, who is the real McCoy? I would say the 
ancient Greeks and the secret societies which followed in their 
footsteps. The Romans and all of their appearances throughout history as
 the Knights Templar, Old World bankers, down to the current time as the
 CIA and Unknown Entity well-hidden behind need-to-know clearances are 
just control freaks. Their pretensions of respect for ancient knowledge,
 in particular, the importance of numbers in the Pythagorean tradition 
is just that, —pretension. The reality is the Bush family and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/pedophilia/">rampant pedophilia</a>.
 Why? Because these people regard us as the walking dead. We do not 
matter to them, and that is the reality of who won this little contest 
for the Pikes Peak batholith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That leaves <em>The Ugly</em>. The Jesuits and BVlack Pope control 
the Catholic church. They represent the progeny of Jove within that 
organization. And now in these end times for the first time ever the 
“black” and “white” pope are one and the same person. What the progeny 
of Jove did once inside the church in Rome is unspeakable. They hoarded 
all the world’s books into what is essentially a private library. They 
utterly destroyed entire cultures and their literary history in Central 
and South America. Life was petty and mean under them. And it has 
continued so down to the present with the unforgivable sexual abuse of 
their own children. The Jesuits and the Black Pope are so ugly I was 
reluctant to give them a page of their own. Their crimes are 
well-documented on this website. And they know what they are doing. That
 is a huge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gnomon</a> in St. Peter’s Square, used to keep an eye on the axial tilt. <em>Everything is about one thing</em>, and you can be sure that includes Vatican City.&nbsp;</p>

 are so-called because nine is the most sacred of sacred numbers.

<h2><span id="Deliberately_provocative_astronomical_symbolism">Deliberately provocative astronomical symbolism</span></h2>
<hr><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">SECTION DIRECTIVE: Quote Shakespeare and then move <strong><em>everything</em></strong>
 about the astrological significance of supposedly “evil” symbolism to 
this section. I want all of it here. Here and only here. There is an 
entire private page on the subject. Consolidate everything to here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">The people I call the progeny of Jove 
despise religion. You can be sure of that, but they are not evil. 
However, their contempt (shared by our Founding Fathers) for mainstream 
Christianity is so intense that they want you to think they are evil. It
 is their way of making fun of your so-called “religion,”—a belief 
system that founded in the Nazarene in name only. I dare say he would 
rather dine with them than with most of what passes as “Christians” 
today. Hence they use deliberately provocative <em>astronomical</em> Symbolism. For mindless “Christianity” these symbols represent something “evil.”</span></p>
<p>As a metaphysician, I find the whole proposition of “evil” to be 
logically absurd. How can there be opposing powers in eternity? Either 
everything is God (good) or everything is matter. But my beliefs are 
irrelevant. Symbols such as Baphomet or goat pentagrams which the 
so-called “Christians” regard as evil and which in what appears to me to
 be a tortured state of mind they fear, in truth are meaningful 
astrological symbols that refer to the Zodiac.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The myriad symbolism of “secret societies” is a thing of the past,</strong></span>
 but useful when trying to understand what is happening in the here and 
now. However, there is a danger of becoming distracted by <em>deliberately provocative astronomical symbolism</em> such as the following image of Baphomet.</p>

 have done throughout history or are doing right now all over the globe,
 but I also do not tolerate suggestions that they are monstrous or 
somehow evil. Such thought stems from the fact this is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>deliberately provocative astronomical symbolism</strong></em></span>, principally goats <em>which are always a direct reference to Capricornus</em>.</p>
<p>Capricornus is the next constellation after Aquarius and what it 
symbolizes is a new world after the coming apocalypse, one in which 
there is no war, pestilence, crime, poverty, or disease. Of the two 
images above, the image of Baphomet to the right is from the immensely 
important <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator#Globes_and_instruments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1551 Mercator celestial globe</a>.
 You will find a lot of explanations for why Capricornus is half fish, 
but the reason is much simpler than what is derived from mythology. It 
is staring you in the face,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>as is almost always the case when such symbolism is correctly interpreted</em></strong></span>. <em>The Aquarius and Capricornus constellations are seriously overlapped.</em>
 Capricornus grows out of Aquarius. Mercator greatly emphasized this in 
his 1551 celestial globe (of which there are 22 still existing). The 
tail of Capricornus seems to flow out of the body of Aquarius. If the 
interpretation seems overly complex, be leery.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Why a goat? Again the answer is always simple. As discussed on page </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/greeks/">№ 8. Origins of the Progeny of Jove</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">,
 the progeny of Jove date back to the Minoan civilization which survived
 what happened in 3100 B.C. atop the mountains on the isle of Crete. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Their primary source of food were mountain goats</em></strong></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>.</em></strong></span> Hence, goats symbolize divine providence, good fortune, survival, and a new beginning. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are not evil<span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p>Their vision of the future is not devil worship, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Age of Reason</a>,
 which I might note is in perfect accord with the highest ideals of the 
United States of America. What you will discover on this website and in 
the MP3 recording they released in 2013 as part of the immensely 
important Walt Disney Pictures’ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">Tomorrowland</a>
 movie, is that they have already developed all of the technology to 
make this possible, including a revolutionary new form of non-polluting 
“free” energy.</p>
<p>They are flaunting religion in part because we are completely 
oblivious to the fact that they wrote The Book of Daniel in the Hebrew 
Bible and The Revelation in the New Testament of the Holy Bible. Yes, 
they detest organized religion, <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but so do I</strong></span>. </em>I
 detest what my own church has become. Organized religion is a platform 
from which we have learned from our parents to melodramatically profess a
 love for mankind that all too often is incongruent with our innermost 
self. The Nazarene (Christ Jesus) was a preeminent metaphysician, but 
Catholicism and <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>every other organized religion of which I am aware</strong></span></em>, including my own, is corrupt to the core, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>is a breeding ground of the very worst traits in human beings</em></strong></span>, and shackles us to an inglorious past.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 33px;">There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so</span></em></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 32px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span> </span></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">— Sir Francis Bacon</p>
<p>I wish the decision to keep this knowledge out of the public domain 
2,600 years ago could be undone, but it is far too late for that. To the
 extent that my powers of abstract reasoning are respected by others, I 
would argue that it is self-evident that, had the decision been made to 
inform the masses of the reality in which we find ourselves even now, we
 most certainly would have been off this planet by now. But that is 
wishful thinking. It is highly doubtful many of us on the surface will 
survive what is about to happen, but as far as my own professed 
Christianity goes, I would trade a lifetime of pain for just one man 
looking me in the eyes while holding the hand of his young child atop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/survival/">Monjeau</a> the morning after and thanking me for the warning which is An Apocalyptic Synthesis.</p>
<p>Having said this, let me tell you how you should think about these 
people. Try to imagine what it would be like to know the exact date on 
which this world will be completely destroyed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientia_potentia_est" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong><em>Scientia potentia est</em></strong></a>
 is rightly attributed to Sir Francis Bacon. It means only one thing, 
specific knowledge of the end time that dates back to previous world 
ages. Unbeknownst to you, specific knowledge of the end time has defined
 and determined every aspect of what you consider to be your life, 
including first and foremost <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>all of recorded history</strong></em></span>.
 Second only to this is the mind-boggling level of control that has been
 exerted over mainstream, “consensus” science and academia. And of 
course, in these end times in which we now find ourselves, the evidence 
that the progeny of Jove are in complete control of mainstream media is 
overwhelming and thoroughly documented on this website.</p>
<p>But all of this is only a natural outgrowth of the decision to keep 
this knowledge out of the public domain, and as I have already said, it 
is far too late to undo that decision. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Given this reality, they are doing the best they know how to keep mankind from rebooting as cavemen</strong></em></span>.
 And for this, despite anything you may read to the contrary on this 
website, which has been written over a period of years during which my 
thought on this subject evolved from what might rightly be characterized
 as contempt bordering on hatred and thorough disgust, to resign myself 
to a shared fate with the masses, and <strong><em>in the end accepting 
the necessity of all that they have done as being in the best interest 
of mankind given the impossible task to which they have dedicated their 
lives</em></strong>, and although they may not appreciate the sentiment, <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I do wish them Godspeed.</strong></span></em></p>
<p>tement in Revelation 2:9, “I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and&nbsp;<i>I know</i>&nbsp;the blasphemy of them&nbsp;<em><strong>which say they are Jews, and are not, but&nbsp;are the synagogue of Satan</strong></em>.” Here you must r</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PAGE FOCUS:</strong></span> We 
live in a world of opposites. Everything is the opposite of what it 
seems. Here I need to introduce a new term, which is “mainstream 
Christianity,” by which I mean no particular denomination. Rather I am 
referring to the popular belief in satan and that the people who are in 
control of the world are evil. Their actions do indeed define them as 
individuals. For and foremost in this regard, I would put hurting a 
child. I have long regarded pedophilia as worse than murder. But 
mainstream Christianity is grossly mistaken in thinking that they are 
engaged in warfare with the force of evil. <em>The “Illuminati” thrive on this delusion</em>.
 What they know is the reality of what happened to our solar system in 
the past. And they know what is going to happen, both to our solar 
system in the near future and to the mass of humanity. I have long 
wanted to collect my thoughts on their use of symbols such as Baphomet 
in one place and explain their real meaning in this light.</p>
<p>Cut from first section on the Australia page…</p>
<p>Over the millennia these lesser mortals, the “beast” of Revelation, 
have developed a symbolism that is specifically intended to appear to us
 as if it is “devil worship” when in reality it simply encodes 
astrological information about our past and the coming axial tilt. Those
 who react to this “evil” provide them with endless entertainment. For 
example, Baphomet is simply a reference to the constellation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/matthew-2428/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capricornus</a>.
 (Christians should understand why. What is the significance of this 
constellation? It represents a time after the Age of Aquarius when the 
pathological individuals in control of this world imagine themselves in 
control of the “new world” with a vastly reduced population. It has 
nothing to do with devil worship.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 48px;">The belief in absolute evil as a permanent part of reality is essentially <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>not</em> </strong></span>monotheistic. Even the Old World bankers know this much, which is why they feel so much disdain for religions.</span></p>
<p>The section that follows on <em>the hitherto unknown world of numbers</em> is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>a plea for sanity</em></strong></span>. The symbolism used by the people I study is <em>deliberately</em> provocative but always astrological in meaning (i.e. <em>not what you think</em>). Honestly, I would not steer you wrong. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It has nothing to do with good or evil.</em></strong></span> But it has everything to do with the end of the Fifth World, which is just around the corner apparently.</p>

<p>This moment of Venus (from earth’s perspective) over an eight year 
period is explained rather well in the following “Astronomy with 
MicroStation Orbit of Venus Dance of Planets”&nbsp; from the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9CmX5PagLg7ulGEBHc2oA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">UjjwalRane</a> YouTube channel.</p>

<p>What you must understand is that before Venus assumed it’s near 
circular orbit of the Sun, which is why it forms this pentagon, Venus 
was a comet that visited great destruction (think Exodus) on the planet.
 The ancients must have been enthralled when they first discovered this 
pattern. This is why the pentagram plays such an important role in the 
symbolism of the progeny of Jove. There is nothing inherently evil about
 it. The pentagram, like all of their symbolism, evidences a knowledge 
of our solar system’s true past. In this sense, its use is indicative of
 intelligence, not evil. And so it is with all of their symbolism which 
they not only allow us to think is evil, but encourage the thought. From
 their perspective, we are the ones being superstitious and inclined to 
attribute evil to things. The fault is ours, not theirs.</p>
<h3><span id="The_constellation_Capricornus_and_goat_symbolism">The constellation Capricornus and goat symbolism</span></h3>
<hr><p>The constellation Capricornus is symbolic of <em>the times in which the secret societies will rule the world</em>, after the Age of Aquarius in which the axial tilt occurs and drowns most of humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capricornus is one of the&nbsp;constellations&nbsp;of 
the&nbsp;zodiac. Its name is&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;for “horned&nbsp;goat” or 
“goat&nbsp;horn” or “having horns like a goat’s”…&nbsp;—<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricornus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tell you of a truth, the United States of America was planned not 
hundreds, but thousands of years in advance of Columbus sailing to the 
“New World.” The year 1776 was chosen because it allowed sufficient time
 for what had to be done (tunneling into the granite in Colorado) and 
the “76” is symbolic of the constellation Capricornus. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/usa/#1776">1776</a> for a full discussion.</p>

<p>I am quoting here from <em>George M. Lamsa’s translation from the Aramaic of the Peshitta</em>
 because the King James Bibles use “eagle” instead of vulture. What does
 this mean? I thought about its meaning for years before coming to any 
conclusion. I now believe it is a reference to the Zodiac. “For 
wheresoever the [carcass] is” is a reference to the end times which 
occur when the vernal equinox Sun rises in Aquarius, which is happening 
now. The eagle or vulture is a reference to the constellation Aquila. 
This is no different than Joshua pointing to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/daniel/">Book of Daniel</a> to indicate the end time. It is a time marker.</p>
<p>Here it is interesting to note the dead bodies referred to as 
“carcasses” are usually not human. A dead goat, however, would most 
certainly be referred to as a carcass. Enoch thinks all the bad guys die
 at this time. Perhaps Joshua is suggesting as much. Aquila is, after 
all, flying over Capricornus, not Aquarius. Just a thought. I’ve learned
 not to underestimate the subtlety of Joshua when it comes to Matthew 
24.</p>
<p>Cut from elsewhere…</p>
<p>n much the same way the progeny of Jove uses supposedly “evil” goat symbols such as an&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span class="_Tgc">inverted pentagram</span></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Baphomet</a>
 to represent the constellation Capricornus (which is Latin for “horned 
goat”). Inverted pentagrams and Baphomat are not evil symbols. They 
point to Capricornus represents the time afterwards in which they 
imagine themselves in control of a world with a greatly reduced 
population.

<hr><p>Wikipedia and other reference works will use the term “Roman 
elite” in reference to what is happening in Rome immediately prior to 
the appearance of the Knights Templar on history’s stage. The Knights 
Templar are anything but Christian. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are the descendants of the real Roman elite from the time of the Roman Empire</em></strong></span>,
 which is to say, they are the progeny of Jove. So as you read the 
following description of the character of the wealthy people (not 
progeny of Jove) in Rome at the time, think of it as setting the stage 
for the return of the progeny of Jove to Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that Europe is a mess is not by chance. Everything that has 
happened since the fall of the Roman Empire has been orchestrated from 
afar. The church in Rome is putrid, the “pornocracy” (think <em>the wife is wearing the trousers in the family and taking them off with some measure of frequency</em>) is a deliberate exaggeration that is now generally recognized as such. So what is really happening?</p>
<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/amallulla.com\/progeny-of-jove\/&quot;}" class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">September 23, 2017 – <span style="color: #ff0000;">900</span> years = <span style="color: #ff0000;">1117 AD</span></div>
<p>This date in history is fast approaching. 900 years before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">September 23, 2017</a>,
 the progeny of Jove will reappear on history’s stage, and before that 
900-year countdown to September 23, 2017, ended, they were in control of
 the entire Western world and are fully prepared for the apocalypse. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Never underestimate the importance of this date to the end time.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;
 It marks the return of the progeny of Jove to Europe. Everything will 
start to rapidly change after that date. Think of it as a progeny of 
Jove version of D-Day.</p>
<p>The last of the Theophylact popes was Pope Benedict IX, 1032–1048. The foundation of the Knights Templar in 1118 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>is only 70 years away</em></strong></span>. So you see this <em>Saeculum obscurum</em>,
 or the time of petty aristocratic rulers in Rome extending their reach 
by taking control of the Catholic church really does set the stage for 
the Knights Templar.</p>

 well-hidden behind “need-to-know” clearances. They control both the 
government and military of the United States of America as well as the 
Federal Reserve and by extension fiat currencies the world over. In 
short, they control everything. It has always been such, even in the 
time of Christ Jesus, whose death they orchestrated and very 
deliberately made sure history would blame the Jews. They despise 
religion.</span></p>

 turned the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency over to a 
Christian Scientist. I know because while still in that office, Admiral 
Stansfield Turner visited Principia, a Christian Science college. I was 
attending at the time and listened to him speak on campus. The Christian
 Scientists would not believe the world could come to an end if Christ 
Jesus told them. <em>He did.</em> <em>And they didn’t. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And they don’t—believe.</strong></span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their day, they were altruistic lovers of knowledge. <em>They include the men who founded the United States of America</em>
 (but most certainly not the men who now control that country). This 
linage ceased to exist in 1947 when the CIA was created. They were over a
 period of some 170 years infiltrated by the Illuminati who effectively 
“beheaded” the Freemasons when the CIA was created. What does that mean?
 It means the Freemasons of today are what I call a “headless corpse,” 
little more than a pretentious (and apparently sometimes <em>licentious</em>) gentlemen’s club. This term <em>headless corpse</em>
 is actually important to my work and is discussed below in detail. In 
practical terms, it means President Truman was a high-ranking Freemason 
but <em>no one, including him, within that organization after 1947 
possessed specific knowledge about the coming destruction of the planet.
 </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is their specific knowledge of the end times that gives the progeny of Jove their power</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">. Men in possession of this knowledge are indomitable.</span>
 Heads of state, captains of industry, and billionaires pale in 
comparison to them. It has been thus for at least 2,600 years now. The 
progeny of Jove are peerless in this world because they know everyone is
 about to die. Individual lives mean nothing to them and they act 
accordingly</strong></p>
<p>This knowledge has been handed down from generation to generation for
 thousands of years, but the progeny of Jove morph from one 
organizational entity to another in order to remain hidden. And when 
they do, they take with them that knowledge. What they leave behind is a
 “headless corpse,” an organization that is a mere shadow of its former 
self. Such is the case with the Freemasons in our lifetime and now the 
CIA.</p>
<p>xxxx</p>
<p>I am talking about members of the Royal Arch, for example, or other 
high-ranking Freemasons of the past who were admitted into the inner 
sanctum of that organization and learned the secret of the ages.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span id="Their_belief_system">Their belief system</span></h2>
<hr><p>This brings us to the belief system of the progeny of Jove. It 
would be difficult to describe how much they loathe religion. The Jews 
are an ancient enemy. <em>They hate the Jews with a ferocity unequaled in the annals of time</em>.&nbsp;They
 attempted to rid the world of Judaism in 73 AD. Subsequently, they 
invented Islam to rival both Judaism and Christianity. One of their main
 objectives in World War II was to create the state of Israel (as they 
“prophesied” in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/http://book%20of%20Revelation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Book of Revelation</a>)
 either because they intend to nuke them at the last minute or because 
Palestine is the last place on earth you want to be during an axial tilt
 (owing to the highly unusual contour of the Mediterranean seabed), or 
both. Anyone who harbors the belief that the Jews are in control of this
 world is completely delusional. These are some of the most persecuted 
people in the history of mankind precisely because they are the № 1 
enemy of the progeny of Jove.</p>
<p>The way I think, <em>everyone has a God</em>. It is whatever they 
think is really happening in life. Even atheists have a God because they
 believe the fabric of the universe is material. Most religions have an 
anthropomorphic, “big guy in the sky” God, this includes almost every 
Christian sect.</p>

</div></figure><p>The progeny of Jove share George Carlin’s animosity 
towards religion, and who can blame them? But it would be a disservice 
to think of the progeny of Jove as mere atheists. They are much, much 
more. The Pythagoreans may have been some of the most cultured “men’s 
men” in the entire history of this world. I am sure I would cower in 
front of one of them in much the same manner I would feel an infinite 
inadequacy in the presence of Christ Jesus. They were intellectual 
giants and unsurpassed athletes. They sought the perfect man, and in 
their day I imagine they largely succeeded. Their intellectual 
underpinnings <em>and their God</em> are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/sacred-numbers/">sacred numbers</a>. I share their fascination.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In fact, I am grateful to Pythagoras for awakening in me a knowledge of the sacred numbers, especially</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/sacred-number-216/">sacred number 216</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I am in awe of the sacred numbers. And I have very little tolerance 
for my co-religionists who would equate the sacred numbers with 
“numerology.” But, I fault the progeny of Jove for failing to realize 
that there is a conscious entity behind the sacred numbers. Christian 
Scientists call that conscious entity Principle, Mind, Spirit, Soul, 
Life, Truth, and Love. Mrs. Eddy was radical in this regard. She had no 
sympathy whatsoever for the popular belief in an anthropomorphic god. 
And I am sure she would have sympathetically laughed at George Carlin’s 
routine.</p>

<p>When we say the “progeny of Jove” essentially what it means is those

<h2><span id="Rules_of_the_game">Rules of the game</span></h2>
<hr><p>Numbers are sacred. They must not lie. They may ingeniously speak
 a truth heard by only a handful, but they must not lie. Once the 
numbers lie, there is no truth. The fabric of this universe is numbers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>A break in the chain of command dictates this rule.</em></strong></span>
 The truth must be recoverable if something should happen that wipes out
 their entire leadership. Let me state this succinctly and pray you are 
not a speed reader, numbers are sacred ground. Think of your most 
majestic church building you can imagine at the moment. That is how 
everyone in this games perceives the use of numbers when communicating, 
and communicate they must. They must sign their work.</p>
<p>This is how people like me discover their world.—Now is one of those moments you want to practice listening.— <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>This is by design</em></span></strong>.
 The knowledge cannot be lost. This brings us to the second most sacred 
rule. You can be clever hiding the truth in numbers, but not too clever.
 There is always an elegant simplicity to truth. This is the rule by 
which all great works are signed. I am sure of this. This is why I do 
not follow other men who make truth sound complex. Truth is not complex.
 As a fledgling who forced his way into the inner sanctum, I would say <em>those words border on being antonyms</em>. This principle defines how I interpret dates and other numerical signatures</p>
<p>Time for a batshit crazy moment. No. I’m okay. That was close. This 
is not a game that suffers fools. No one in this arena is disrespected. 
Even in my make-believe world, the purveyors of wisdom gave the Stone of
 Destiny to the winners,—to Colorado—back in 1929. We live by the grace 
of God, but I will not die for want of respect.</p>

<p>You have known them as the Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Freemasons,

website as “headless corpses” now because <em>when the progeny of Jove 
morph from one organizational entity to another they take with them

<p><span style="font-size: 36px;">We have already introduced the concept
 of a headless corpse in the previous sections. Let us now thoroughly 
define this concept. Anciently the <em>progeny of Jove</em> were 
peoples, first the Phrygians, who survived previous world destructions 
in underground cities every bit as sophisticated in their day as are the
 underground tunnels in the Pikes Peak granite batholith of today (what 
Virgil described as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/vault/"><em>Vault Profound</em></a>).
 Thereafter they became the Greeks and then the Romans. Does this mean 
they were Phrygians posing as Greeks and Romans? No. They “morphed” from
 one peoples to another, by which I mean over time the Phrygians blended
 in with the Greeks and became indistinguishable from them. The same 
happened when the progeny of Jove morphed from ancient Greece to Rome. 
There are still traces of this today in the cultural, genetic, and 
linguistic similarities of these three peoples.</span></p>
<p>Sometime around 27 BC they began to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/gods-many/">migrate to South America</a> where they would be headquartered for about the next 1,000 years. <em>Since
 their return to Europe from the Americas, they are no longer 
identifiable as a people except to say that they are doubtless all 
caucasian</em>. Instead they are now embodied in organizations starting with the Knights Templar and ending with what I call the <em>Unnamed Entity</em>
 that hides behind “need-to-know” clearances and which controls both the
 government and military of the United States of America.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Whenever
 the progeny of Jove morph from one organizational entity to another 
they take with them knowledge of the end times from which they derive 
their unrivaled power.</strong></span></p>
<p>For example, in the not too distant past the progeny of Jove surfaced
 as the Freemasons in 1717 in order to establish the United States of 
America and directly control it through the presidency, which they did 
until the time of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/jfk/">JFK</a>.
 Before his election, they morphed into the CIA. When they did, the 
Freemasons lost the knowledge of the end time which gave them the power 
the wielded for over a century.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">It
 is only the leadership of the organization they control at any given 
time that knows about the coming apocalyptic destruction of the world. 
The people they leave behind when they morph from one organizational 
entity to another know nothing.</p>
<p>Hence the leadership within the Freemasons has not been privy to the 
coming apocalyptic destruction of the world since the CIA was formed 
after WWII.<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> I refer to this as the <em>beheading</em> of an organization used by the Progeny of Jove to advance their cause.</span></strong> <em>That organization is now a “headless corpse.”</em> It knows nothing. The same has been true of the CIA since 1976 when the progeny of Jove morphed into the <em>Unnamed Entity</em> which hides behind “need-to-know” clearances that exclude even sitting presidents.</p>
<p>This is why Manly P. Hall lamented the former emphasis on esoteric 
knowledge over fraternity among the Freemasons. He lived through a 
transition of which he was evidently unaware. As I said above, today the
 Freemasons are little more than a pretentious men’s club that does not 
understand its own origins and history, which is more or less precisely 
what Manly P. Hall said towards the end of his life. The same is true of
 the CIA, which after 1976 becomes little more than an intelligence 
bureaucracy. As if to emphasize this point, Stansfield Turner, a 
Christian Scientist, was appointed Director of Central Intelligence in 
1977.</p>

<hr><p>On my homepage, I state that “a diabolical plan dating back 
thousands of years is coming to fruition.” For me, it is self-evident 
that mankind is living on a defective planet, or at least on the only 
inhabitable planet in a <em>defective solar system</em> that is far too 
close to the gravitational behemoth Sirius. As the Egyptian priest said 
to Solon, “There have been, and will be again, many destructions of 
mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about
 by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable
 other causes.” ―Timaeus By Plato</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Something is routinely erasing our memory. We simply must get off this planet in order to survive.</strong></span></p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/progeny/#origins-of-the-progeny-of-jove-circa-600-bc">Origins of the Progeny of Jove (circa 600 B.C.)</a>,
 sometime shortly after the last encounter of Mars and Earth on March 
23, 686 BC, the people who the ancient Roman poet Virgil and I both 
refer to as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/progeny/"><em>progeny of Jove</em></a>
 (think Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, etc.) decided that 
they would attempt what evidently has never been accomplished before, 
which is to survive the worst of the catastrophes to which earth is 
routinely subject with hoards of supplies, a cadre of the best minds 
(and soldiers) alive, and technology (such as “free” energy and 
anti-gravity propulsion systems) the likes of which most of us have 
never seen before or even imagined.</p>
<p>With a newly formed planet, the mass of humanity dead, and a 
one-world government, they would be in a position to jumpstart the New 
World and get us off this planet. But their plan truly is diabolical 
because it involves a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/wikipedi/">planned population explosion</a>
 in order to harness the brain power of the best and brightest of 
billions of people who are about to die a violent death. Yet what I am 
about to suggest is that there is ample evidence these very same men 
took precautions that are indicative of a deep, almost philosophical 
concern for the welfare of mankind.<em> How can I reconcile these two very different points of view? </em>It
 takes some practice, I must admit. Even as I write this the struggle to
 see the good in what they are doing rages within me. I think, had they 
let everyone know what was going to happen 2,600 years ago, that we 
could have already been off the planet. But it is way too late in the 
game to contemplate such alternative realities.</p>
<p>In trying to explain things from their perspective, there is only one
 analogy that works, life or death situations in combat. Officers 
sometimes must sacrifice a few men in order to save the majority under 
their command. They make decisions which directly result in the death of
 their own soldiers. Doing so is sometimes unavoidable. We’ve all seen 
scenes like this in war movies. I saw one just last night watching All 
the King’s Men with my domestic partner. Now magnify this hardcore 
battlefield reality <em>by orders of magnitude</em>. Think to yourself, 
how long has this been happening? How long has Mother Earth and Father 
Sky been cannibalizing their unsuspecting children? I am collecting 
evidence about this in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/how-old-is-mankind/">№ 38. How Old is Mankind?</a> page, but I for one am utterly convinced that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/megalithic/">polygonal, megalithic stone builders</a>
 could “melt rock” and were more advanced than us. Plus there is 
evidence of a worldwide, highly interconnected civilization and a more 
advanced geometry than we use in the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/munck/">Carl Munck</a>.
 And using two entirely different analytical approaches, there is 
evidence that the face on Mars is part of a mathematical message 
intended to be read off planet. And I cannot seriously entertain for 
even a moment the thought that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built by a 
civilization inferior to ours. Such lists are endless. And new evidence 
of technically advanced civilizations that predate our own is being 
discovered all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What
 thinking individual can doubt the prior existence of a people who were 
technological superior to us in every respect? Seriously? Would you be 
counted among them? And if such a reversion has happened even once, then
 there is no practical limit to the number of times it may have 
happened. We may be caught is a cycle of destruction that is millions of
 years old and quote possibly billions of years old.</strong></span></p>
<p>Now in order to complete this mental exercise, I must ask that you 
become an actor for a minute or two and imagine you are the progeny of 
Jove around 600 B.C. We cannot judge these men by the psychopaths who 
are in control of the world now. The memories of February 26th, 747 BC 
and March 23, 687 BC, when Mars wreaked havoc on the planet and changed 
the length of a year from a perfect 360 days to the present 365.24 days,
 were not much older for them than would be memories of the Civil War 
for us. They knew and understand the unimaginable forces at work during 
one of these solar system configurations. And they could still remember 
the Golden Age and all that was lost since Proto-Saturn exploded and 
Venus morphed from being a Goddess into a threatening dragon. Our myths 
were living memories for them.</p>
<p>What price would you pay to put an end to all of this? Think of all 
the suffering in this age alone from 3100 BC to the present: Genghis 
Khan; Julius Caesar; Adolf Hitler. Endless wars and generations upon 
generations of subsistence living. For what? It is about to start all 
over again. And again. And again. And again ad infinitum. Let us assume 
this really has been happening for countless ages. As a military 
commander, would you not ask for the ultimate sacrifice of just one of 
these ages to save countless future ages? In other words, if you had to 
sacrifice the lives of everyone who has ever lived from 3100 BC until 
now (an estimated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">100 billion lives</a>)
 in order to stop what is happening, to bridge the gap of the worst of 
these destructions, the very one that is at our doorstep even now, how 
is that different than the battlefield commander who sacrifices a 
handful of men in order to save the majority of those under his commend?
 Other than being on a much larger scale, there is no difference.</p>
<p>But this mental exercise is not quite over. Having made this 
commitment, you must harden your yourself to the reality. You must 
pledge to one another that the lives of your fellow human beings are 
little more than canon fodder. You must teach yourself to think in such a
 way that your objective take precedence over any consideration 
whatsoever for the living. You must learn to think of them as the 
walking dead. Such callousness is not without cost. Factor in more than a
 few generations of interbreeding, and what we may be looking at is the 
cause for the genetic defect of the the psychopaths who are in control 
of the world right now. In other words, this may be a failed experiment 
that has bred a new race of men who present an entirely new threat to 
our species. But I must reiterate, we cannot judge the men alive in 600 
B.C. by the men in control of the world now. Were you to place G.W. Bush
 on a stage next to Pythagorus, I think the the latter would unsheathe 
his sword and run the former through in less than five minutes.</p>

<hr><p>See page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://amallulla.com/knights/">№ 64. Knights Templar</a>.</p>
<p>The progeny of Jove are not unlike a church in that that have had a 
number of schisms and the first of those was between the Knights Templar
 and the papacy. At the time the Knights Templar was the banking arm of 
the progeny of Jove and the papacy was the religious arm. But this was 
never meant to happen. A greedy French King is responsible. The 
following account of what happened entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/news/knights-templar-downfall-confessions-torture" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Why the Knights Templar Gave False Confessions of Depravity</a> written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/author/greg-daugherty" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Greg Daugherty</a> on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">History</a> website is the best account of what happened I think that has ever been written. I have copied it here for the sake of adding <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>bold-red</strong></span> emphasis, but encourage you to read the original.</p>
<p>You will want to pay particular attention to two things. The first is
 well documented in the article, which is that King Philip IV of France 
had already set a clear pattern of robbing the rich to give to <del>the poor</del>
 himself. In that sense, this really had nothing to do with the Knights 
Templar, at least not until March 22, 1312 when Pope Clement V, “a 
former French bishop far more acquiescent to Philip,” abolished the 
Order of the Templars by “an inviolable and perpetual decree.” That 
began a schism that has colored all of history and would come back to 
haunt the Catholic Church in Rome 222 years later when <a title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ignatius of Loyola</a> founded the Jesuits on August 15, 1534 at Montmartre (a large hill <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>13</strong></span>0 meters high), Paris, France and Pope Paul III approved the Society of Jesus on September 27, 1540.</p>
<p>The second thing you will want to pay particular attention to is that
 the Knights Templar were already Europe’s bankers. This is fascinating 
when you realize it was the Rothschilds and other European bankers who 
approached ‎Adam Weishaupt. a defrocked Jesuit, with the idea of 
starting the <em>Illuminatenorden</em>, or Order of Illuminati, and it was the</p>

 were revered throughout medieval Europe as the fiercest, wealthiest and
 most powerful military order of the era. So how were they obliterated 
with such devastating swiftness?</p>
<p>Lies, spies and torture—lots of torture—masterminded by a power-hungry, money-mad king.</p>
<p>Philip IV of France began his campaign to quash the Templars on 
September 14, 1307, when he sent sealed orders to his officers across 
the kingdom, with instructions that they not be opened until the night 
of October 12. The king had good reason for secrecy. His plan—to arrest 
every Templar in France—would have been unthinkable even a few years 
earlier.</p>

<p>The Templars, a Roman Catholic military order that answered only to 
the pope, had for more than a century enjoyed a reputation as heroic 
fighters who distinguished themselves in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Crusades</a>. Pope Boniface VIII had praised them as “fearless warriors of Christ” just a decade before Philip’s move against them.</p>

<p>But Boniface was no longer in the picture, having died in 1303, barely a month after Philip’s agents had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/news/french-king-kidnapping-pope-philip-iv-boniface-vii" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">terrorized him</a> and held him hostage. The new pope was Clement V, <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">a former French bishop far more acquiescent to Philip</span>. The Templars were now fair game—and their arrests, carried out on the morning of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/news/why-friday-the-13th-spelled-doom-for-the-knights-templar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Friday, October 13</a>, launched one of the bloodiest and most brutal episodes in church history.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 108px; font-size: 48px;">Philip sees a rich target</p>
<p>They wouldn’t be the first group Philip had targeted, largely to fill
 the royal coffers. In 1292 he had arrested the Lombards, wealthy 
Italian merchants, seized their property and forced them to buy French 
nationality from him if they wished to stay. In 1306, he ordered the 
arrest of some 100,000 French Jews, along with the confiscation of their
 property. “They were told to leave the kingdom within a month on pain 
of death,” writes Dan Jones in his 2017 book, <em>The Templars</em>.</p>
<p>Needing yet another source of plunder, he turned his attention to the Templars, some 5,000 of whom lived in France.</p>
<p>Even though individual Templars had taken a vow of poverty, the order
 had become enormously wealthy over the decades, accumulating fleets of 
ships and vast property holdings throughout Europe.</p>
<p>While they were often referred to as the Knights Templar, only a 
minority of the group’s members were actually knights; others were 
priests and “serving brethren,” who came to hold a wide range of jobs. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">By
 1300, many were essentially bankers. In London, for example, the group 
“operated a system of national and international credit and finance,” 
notes British historian Stephen Howarth in his book, <em>The Knights Templar</em>.
 “Kings, merchants and noblemen deposited gold, silver and jewels with 
them for safe-keeping, and came to them for loans, or to make payments 
to people overseas.” They even seem to have invented a medieval version

<p>Still, the Templars’ reputation as warriors persisted. So, when Pope 
Clement called the order’s Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, to France in 
late 1306, supposedly to discuss launching another crusade to the Holy 
Land, the request didn’t seem unusual.</p>

<p>De Molay arrived in France in early 1307, with an entourage of 60 
knights, and spent the next several months in meetings there. During 
that time, “The secret agents of the French king immediately circulated 
various dark rumors and odious reports concerning the Templars,” wrote 
Charles G. Addison in an 1842 history of the group. Philip’s spies also 
attempted to infiltrate the Templars and compiled a dossier of 
scurrilous charges against them from disaffected former members and 
others with battle axes to grind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 108px; font-size: 48px;">Grisly torture was used to elicit confessions</p>
<p>That was all the excuse Philip needed to send out his arrest orders 
in September 1307. Not only were the Templars to be arrested, and their 
property seized, but they were to be imprisoned, interrogated and, if 
necessary, tortured. The instructions added, “you are to promise them 
pardon and favor if they confess the truth, but if not, you are to 
acquaint them that they will be condemned to death.”</p>
<p>The purpose of torture “was not to obtain the actual truth,” writes French historian Alain Demurger in his 2019 book, <em>The Persecution of the Knights Templar</em>,
 “but to elicit the specific truth that the accusers wanted to hear—it 
was that truth, or death.” Among the charges the Templars were expected 
to confess to: renouncing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.biography.com/people/jesus-christ-9354382" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Christ</a> and spitting on the cross.</p>

<p>In Paris, the king’s inquisitors tortured 138 Templars, most of whom 
eventually made confessions. Many were subjected to “fire torture,” 
which Addison describes in vivid detail: “their legs were fastened in an
 iron frame, and the soles of their feet were greased over with fat or 
butter; they were then placed before the fire, and a screen was drawn 
backwards and forwards, so as to moderate and regulate the heat. Such 
was the agony produced by this roasting operation, that the victim often
 went raving mad.”</p>
<p>Jones details some of the other techniques used to coerce confessions
 from the Templars, including starvation, sleep deprivation, relentless 
questioning and the <em>strappado</em>—“a device that yanked the victim’s tethered arms behind him until he was raised from the ground and his shoulders dislocated.”</p>
<p>Unable to withstand these tortures, many Templars did eventually 
confess—even Grand Master de Molay, who admitted renouncing Christ and 
spitting near a cross, though not directly on it. He urged other 
Templars to confess, as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 108px; font-size: 48px;">Charges included cat worshipping and navel kissing</p>
<p>In 1309 the pope began his own inquiry, which would continue 
intermittently into 1311. Rather than assessing the guilt or innocence 
of individual Templars, its primary goal was to determine whether the 
pope should abolish the entire order.</p>
<p>By now the accusations against the Templars and their order had grown
 to a total of 127. On the list: worshipping cats, condoning theft and 
perjury to enrich the order and kissing each other’s navels during 
secret initiation ceremonies.</p>
<p>The pope established a commission of bishops and other high-ranking 
churchmen to hear the evidence, both pro and con. Believing they were no
 longer at the king’s mercy and would be protected by the pope, many 
Templars took the opportunity to describe the tortures they’d suffered 
and to recant their earlier confessions. For some, that proved to be a 
fatal miscalculation.</p>
<p>In May 1310, the archbishop of Sens, whose brother happened to be 
among the king’s closest associates, ordered that 54 Templars who had 
recanted be burned at the stake as relapsed heretics. Soon after, 
another 14 Templars met the same fiery fate. One dead Templar was even 
pulled from his grave so his bones could be burned.</p>
<p>By now it was clear to surviving Templars that they could either confess or die. Most confessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 108px; font-size: 48px;">The Pope seals their fate</p>
<p>In March <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>[22]</strong></span>,
 1312, the pope finally announced his decision. Based on the confessions
 and other evidence, he said, he was abolishing the Order of the 
Templars, by “an inviolable and perpetual decree.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the end of it, however. There remained some loose ends, 
one of them being the elderly grand master de Molay, still imprisoned in
 Paris. In March 1314, he and three other Templar leaders were put on 
public display outside the Cathedral of Notre Dame, where three 
cardinals appointed by the pope were to pronounce their sentences.</p>
<p>The event didn’t go as planned. When de Molay and another prisoner 
learned they faced life in prison, they lashed out at the cardinals, 
denounced the injustice of the whole process, and proclaimed their 
innocence.</p>
<p>Centuries later, an enterprising Italian scholar would discover one 
reason de Molay may have been surprised by the cardinals’ ruling. 
Digging through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://www.history.com/news/step-into-the-vaticans-secret-archives" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vatican Secret Archives</a> in 2001, Dr. Barbara Frale found a misfiled copy of an August 1308 document known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/http://www.theknightstemplar.org/chinon-parchment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chinon Parchment</a>.
 It chronicled the interrogation of de Molay and several other 
high-ranking Templars, conducted by representatives of the pope in 
Chinon, France, who pressed them on such issues as renouncing the cross,
 sodomy and kissing on the mouth. The long-lost document revealed that 
after de Molay testified and pleaded for mercy for his sins, he had been
 granted absolution, or forgiveness, by the church. (The Vatican made 
the parchment public in 2007.)</p>

<p>But in 1314 even life imprisonment wasn’t a harsh enough sentence as 
far as King Philip IV was concerned. When he heard about de Molay’s 
protest, he ordered both him and his compatriot burned at the stake that
 night.</p>
<p>In addition to the Templars who were burned alive, many others would 
die during their years of harsh confinement. Some succumbed during 
torture, refusing to the end to confess sins they had never committed.</p>

<hr><p>The Rosicrucians and the Freemasons never had anything to do with
 the Order of the Illuminati (i.e the bankers) from the very beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Conflict with Rosicrucians</strong></p>
<p>At all costs, Weishaupt wished to keep the existence of the order 
secret from the Rosicrucians, who already had a considerable foothold in
 German Freemasonry. While clearly Protestant, the Rosicrucians were 
anything but anticlerical, were pro-monarchic, and held views clearly 
conflicting with the Illuminati vision of a rationalist state run by 
philosophers and scientists. The Rosicrucians were not above promoting 
their own brand of mysticism with fraudulent seances. A conflict became 
inevitable as the existence of the Illuminati became more evident, and 
as prominent Rosicrucians, and mystics with Rosicrucian sympathies, were
 actively recruited by Knigge and other over-enthusiastic helpers. 
Kolowrat was already a high ranking Rosicrucian, and the mystic Prince 
Charles of Hesse-Kassel had a very low opinion of the rationalist higher
 grades of the Illuminati.</p>
<p>The Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, began a
 sustained attack on the Illuminati. Wöllner had a specially engineered 
room in which he convinced potential patrons of the effectiveness of 
Rosicrucian “magic”, and his order had acquired effective control of the
 “Three Globes” and its attached lodges. Through this mouthpiece, the 
Illuminati were accused of atheism and revolutionary tendencies. In 
April 1783, Frederick the Great informed Charles of Hesse that the 
Berlin lodges had documents belonging to the Minervals or Illuminati 
which contained appalling material, and asked if he had heard of them. 
All Berlin masons were now warned against the order, which was now 
accused of Socinianism, and of using the liberal writings of Voltaire 
and others, alongside the tolerance of Freemasonry, to undermine all 
religion. In November 1783, the Three Globes described the Illuminati as
 a masonic sect which sought to undermine Christianity and turn 
Freemasonry into a political system. Their final anathema, in November 
1784, refused to recognize any Illuminati as Freemasons.</p>
<p>In Austria, the Illuminati were blamed for anti-religious pamphlets 
that had recently appeared. The Rosicrucians spied on Joseph von 
Sonnenfels and other suspected Illuminati, and their campaign of 
denunciation within Freemasonry completely shut down Illuminati 
recruitment in Tyrol.</p>
<p>The Bavarian Illuminati, whose existence was already known to the 
Rosicrucians from an informant, were further betrayed by the reckless 
actions of Ferdinand Maria Baader, an Areopagite who now joined the 
Rosicrucians. Shortly after his admission it was made known to his 
superiors that he was one of the Illuminati, and he was informed that he
 could not be a member of both organizations. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>His letter of resignation stated that the Rosicrucians did not possess secret knowledge</strong></span>, and ignored the truly Illuminated, specifically identifying Lodge Theodore as an Illuminati Lodge.</p>

<hr><p style="font-size: 36px;">The Inquisition was Rome’s answer to a 
declaration of war delivered to the front doorstep, so-to-speak. I’m not
 talking about Fernando and Isabella here. They were just jumping on the
 bandwagon. This story begins much earlier. Here I introduce a number of
 interrelated timelines for your consideration. The objective of this 
exercise is to determine if these timelines support my theory that there
 was hell to pay once Rome learned that architectural details on their 
unimaginably expensive cathedrals mocked them in a symbolic language 
previously understood by only the architects. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>And these architectural details</strong> were chiseled in stone at dizzying heights.</em></span></p>

 bishops and abbots were themselves usually part of the ruling nobility.
 Given that most members of the European nobility practiced 
primogeniture, and willed their titles of nobility to the eldest

Since a substantial amount of wealth and land was usually associated with the office of a&nbsp;<a title="Bishop" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bishop</a>&nbsp;or abbot, the sale of church offices—a practice known as “<a title="Simony" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simony" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">simony</a>“—
was an important source of income for leaders among the nobility, who 
themselves owned the land and by charity allowed the building of 
churches. Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular
 administration, as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary 
nobility with family interests.&nbsp;They justified their power by the 
theory of the&nbsp;<a title="Divine right of kings" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">divine right of kings</a>.</p>

 which heretofore was tolerated on the theoretical basis of the “divine 
right of kings” but in reality because the churches were built on land 
owned by the nobility. Only those families are beginning to sell the 
churches on their property to generate much-needed income. This is 
something new because church administration was always the 
responsibility of the local nobility in the past. Who is going to 
administer the churches now that they are not owned by the nobility? The
 answer is Rome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here it is best to stop and clearly define the term bishop as used in the Roman Catholic church.</p>
<p>the primacy of Peter</p>
<p>The&nbsp;primacy of the bishop of Rome&nbsp;is largely derived from 
his role as the&nbsp;apostolic successor&nbsp;to&nbsp;Saint Peter, to 
whom&nbsp;primacy&nbsp;was conferred by&nbsp;Jesus, giving him 
the&nbsp;Keys of Heaven&nbsp;and the powers of “binding and loosing”, 
naming him as the “rock” upon which the church would be built.</p>

<p>During the conflict between Frederick I and the papacy, the problem 
of heresy required a political solution.

<p>In 1233 Gregory IX established the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Papal Inquisition" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Inquisition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Papal Inquisition</a>&nbsp;to regularize the persecution of&nbsp;<a title="Heresy" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">heresy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Vizzier_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_in_Rama#cite_note-Vizzier-3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;The
 Papal Inquisition was intended to bring order to what had become the 
haphazard episcopal inquisitions, originally established by&nbsp;<a title="Pope Lucius III" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Lucius_III" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lucius III</a>&nbsp;in
 1184. Gregory’s aim was to bring order and legality to the process of 
dealing with heresy, since there had been tendencies by mobs of 
townspeople to burn alleged heretics without much of a trial. In 1231 
Pope Gregory IX appointed a number of Papal Inquisitors (<i>Inquisitores haereticae pravitatis</i>), mostly&nbsp;<a title="Dominican Order" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dominicans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Franciscan" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Franciscans</a>,
 for the various regions of France, Italy and parts of Germany. The aim 
was to introduce due process and objective investigation into the 
beliefs of those accused to the often erratic and unjust persecution of 
heresy on the part of local ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions.<sup id="cite_ref-Madden_4-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119205404/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_in_Rama#cite_note-Madden-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>

</div></figure><p>What Mick Jagger is saying is that these people have 
been steering history for centuries. The truth is they decided to take 
control of the Fifth World no later than 2,600 BC, over a half a 
millennia before Jesus was born. They brutally murdered him for telling 
his disciples about the coming axial tilt and then they bastardized 
Christianity to suit their own needs. As I say on my homepage, our 
entire world is of their invention, not just history. It is the 
real-life Matrix.</p>

<hr><p>1 All lifespans are taken directly from Wikipedia except for 
Isaiah and Daniel. In the case of Isaiah, Wikipedia and Encyclopedia 
Britannica will only commit to him living sometime in the 8th-century 
BC. Regarding the dating of the text, Wikipedia does say, “The 
traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were 
written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and 
c. 686 BCE ―. The lifespan for Isaiah was somewhat arbitrarily lifted 
from the thenagain.info website. In the case of the prophet Daniel, 
Wikipedia is citing “Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his Qur’anic commentary.” For
 Amos (added late), I once again rather arbitrarily lifted the birth 
date from hyperhistory.com for time’s sake. Wikipedia does say that 
“Amos was active c. 760–755 BCE” and gives the year of his death as 745 
BCE.</p>
