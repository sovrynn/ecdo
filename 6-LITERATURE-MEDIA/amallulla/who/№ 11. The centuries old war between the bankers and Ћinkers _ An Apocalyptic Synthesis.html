Please note that I was working on the first section entitled Construction start and end dates for the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. when I decided to walk away from the entire website.

<p class="page-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PAGE STATUS</strong></span>:
 This is a new page and represents a radical rewriting of the old page №
 11. History of the European Illuminati based on an equally radical new 
understanding of our true history. I am selectively moving stuff from 
the old to the new page. It will take time for this new page to take 
form. Until then, I recommend reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Bavarian Illuminati primer</a>
 compiled by Trevor W. McKeown. Please note that I was working on the 
first section entitled Construction start and end dates for the House of
 the Temple in Washington, D.C. when I decided to walk away from the 
entire website. I’m really not of a mind to finish it. The references to
 the Knights Templar were a mistake I was in the process of 
correcting.&nbsp;<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: April 21, 2021</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Why are Freemason floors checkered? The answer to this question is staring you in the face. B<em>y
 walking on their famous black and white checkered floors during their 
lodge meetings, the Freemasons are symbolically trampling on the black 
and white banner and shield carried by the Knights Templar</em>. Before, during, and after what we think of as the <em>Civil War</em>,
 the bankers and Ћinkers have battled not so much for the control of The
 United States of America, but for Pikes Peak batholith, which is one of
 the most unique granite batholiths in the whole world and ideally 
suited for surviving the coming Earth crustal displacement.</p>
<div class="impact-72" style="text-align: center;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.08</span> billion-year-old<br>Pikes Peak batholith</div>
<p>Eventually, what you will learn on this website is that all of what 
we know of as history can be explained in the following image of the 
Pikes Peak batholith in the Front Range near Denver, Colorado. 
Wikipedia,—an important tool of the progeny of Jove and a future 
educational toy for their children in the next world,—describes the 
batholith with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>highly unusual specificity</em></strong></span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pikes Peak granite is a <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1.08</strong></span></em> billion-year-old widespread geologic formation found in the central part of the Front Range of Colorado.</p>

<p>This is where you will find Virgil’s “vault profound” as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">№ 58. The multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>There is no other granite batholith at such a high altitude and so far from an ocean shore</strong> <strong>anywhere else in the world</strong>.</em></span>
 It is the ideal location for surviving an Earth crustal displacement. 
And there is irrefutable evidence in Rosalyn Chapel that a people I call
 the <em>progeny of Jove</em> (at the time they were known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/knights/">Knights Templar</a>)
 were not only aware of this long before Christopher Columbus set sail 
in 1492, but visited North America before then on several occasions. 
Indeed, there is reason to believe some of them lived here after leaving
 France. Their fleet only disappeared in the eyes of the ruling elite at
 the time and in our so-called <em>history</em> books.</p>

<p>Why are the Freemasons of the South going to such lengths to 
emphasize the Mason-Dixon line half a century after the end of the Civil
 War? Well, the obvious answer is that they resent losing the war. This 
is the general understanding of the Mason-Dixon line, that it separates 
the North from the South.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The largest, east-west portion of the Mason–Dixon line along the 
southern Pennsylvania border later became known, informally, as the 
boundary between the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_United_States" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Northern</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">free states</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Southern</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">slave states</a>.

<p><span style="font-size: 36px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>So one might say the House of the Temple was completed in stubborn defiance of the North.</em></strong></span>
 But this is hopelessly shallow thinking and completely ignores the 
character of these men. The Freemasons of the South, starting with the 
first president of the United States of America, General George 
Washington who led the fight against the British Empire, <em>are</em> 
our Founding Fathers. In fact, one reason why the House of the Temple 
had to be built is that these are the same men who designed Washington 
D.C. and the House of the Temple was the crown jewel of that design. We 
know this thanks to the work of Scott Onstott, who I regard with the 
highest esteem.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="intro">The real reason</div>
<p>I’ve never liked the term <em>uninitiated</em>. I’m something of an 
extreme equalitarian. But when faced with trying to explain why the 
Freemasons of the South went to such extremes to emphasize the 
Mason-Dixon line in the construction of their headquarters, I wish the 
gap I perceive between me and the average reader were not so 
large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To appreciate what I am saying, you must read a number of other pages on this website including pages&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">№ 27. The grossly misunderstood Georgia Guidestones</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/civil-war/">№ 54. Civil&nbsp;War and the fall of Freemasonry in the South</a>.
 This is all about the so-called Civil War. The Freemasons of the South 
are trying to tell us that it was not what we think it was. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In
 this case, they are making a powerful statement about the difference 
between the Northern Jurisdiction and the Southern Jurisdiction.</em></strong></span>
 The former was used to take control of the country. The very first 
Freemason president of the United States of American from the Northern 
Jurisdiction was President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">James Buchanan</a>, 1857-1861 (Pennsylvania), who was a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://lodge43.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lodge No.&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>43</strong></em></span>, Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And he is the one who instigated the War Between the States.</em></strong></span> That was his primary task while in office. <span style="font-size: 36px;">The significance of this lodge number to the bankers cannot be overstated. You can read about it in the sections entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/bonesmen/#What_does_322_mean_The_Bonesmen_at_Yale_did_not_invent_322"><em>What does 322 mean?

 Perhaps the most significant use of the number 43 for this generation 
is the numeric signature on the design of the World Trade Center before 
it was destroyed on September 11, 2001. That use of 43 is discussed in 
the section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#The_World_Trade_Center_was_designed_and_built_to_be_destroyed"><em>The World Trade Center was designed and built to be destroyed</em></a> also on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 28.

<hr><p style="font-size: 36px;">The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Perfectibilists</a> (later known as the <i>Illuminatenorden</i>, or <em>Order of Illuminati</em>,) were founded on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Germany. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The difference between this secret society and the Ћinkers (the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons) is night and day.</em></span></strong>
 The fact that the general public lumps all three of these secret 
societies together is deplorable. I refer to the Order of Illuminati as 
the <em>European</em> Illuminati on this website because they were 
started when a disaffected Jesuit priest by the name Adam Weishaupt (who
 evidently knew everything the Jesuits knew about the end time and 
therefore <em>was by definition a progeny of Jove</em>) was approached 
by the Old World bankers who wanted to know everything he did and needed
 a cover for their future exploits in the Americas. They had one goal 
and one goal only in mind, which was to take control of the Pikes Peak 
batholith in the Front Range, which would first require taking control 
of the colonies. The United States of America was not even a country at 
the time, but they knew the Freemasons were about to declare their 
independence from the British Empire. In less than 90 years they 
established their base of operations in the Ohio River valley, 
infiltrated the Freemasons in the South, organized the “Northern Masonic
 District and Jurisdiction” on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>May 1</em></strong></span>,
 1813 (the same date on which the European Illuminati were founded), 
founded the Order of the Skull and Bones in 1832 for recruiting new 
members, got one of their own elected to the presidency in 1857, 
instigated the so-called Civil War in 1861, finally got the Federal 
Reserve Act passed into law on December 23, 1913, and eventually took 
control of not only the United States of America but through the power 
of fiat currency, major corporations, Republicanism and the 
corruptibility of public officials, of the entire Western world.</p>
<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<div class="intro">scientia sit potentia</div>
<p style="font-size: 36px;">The Progeny of Jove derive their power in this world from specific knowledge of the end time, <em>what</em> is going to happen, and <em>when</em>. This knowledge <em>is</em> power, never more so than now.</p>
<p style="font-size: 36px;">On one side is the bankers. On the other 
side are the Ћinkers, the original Rosicrucians and Freemasons. All the 
while there are the <i lang="it">Stato della Città del Vaticano</i> or 
Vatican City and the Vatican Library, which since the founding of the 
Society of Jesus in this context is best thought of as the Jesuits and 
Black Pope.</p>
<p style="font-size: 36px;">All three groups are multigenerational. Thus
 the defining characteristic of these three groups of men beyond a 
knowledge of the end time is their ability to outlive governments and 
sometimes even countries. They are at war with each other and have been 
for centuries now.</p>
<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<div class="intro">There can be only one</div>
<p style="font-size: 36px;">If you have not watched Highlander, a movie 
about a class of immortals who kill each other off by decapitation with a
 sword until there’s only one left, I highly recommend you do so. What 
it provides, perhaps better than anything else can, is a sense of this 
multigenerational struggle for dominance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-size: 32px;">FREEMASONRY is a fraternity within a 
fraternity – an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood of 
the elect. Before it is possible to intelligently discuss the origin of 
the Craft, it is necessary, therefore, to establish the existence of 
these two separate yet interdependent orders, the one visible and the 
other invisible. The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of “free 
and accepted” men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical, educational,
 fraternal, patriotic, and humanitarian concerns. The invisible society 
is a secret and most august fraternity whose members are dedicated to 
the service of a mysterious arcanum arcanorum. Those Brethren who have 
essayed to write the history of their Craft have not included in their 
disquisitions the story of that truly secret inner society which is to 
the body Freemasonic what the heart is to the body human.In each 
generation only a few are accepted into the inner sanctuary of the Work,
 but these are veritable Princes of the Truth and their sainted names 
shall be remembered in future ages together with the seers and prophets 
of the elder world. Though the great initiate-philosophers of 
Freemasonry can be counted upon one’s fingers, yet their power is not to
 be measured by the achievements of ordinary men. They are dwellers upon
 the Threshold of the Innermost, Masters of that secret doctrine which 
forms the invisible foundation of every great theological and rational 
institution.</p>
<p>The outer history of the Masonic order is one of noble endeavor, 
altruism, and splendid enterprise; the inner history, one of silent 
conquest, persecution, and heroic martyrdom. The body of Masonry rose 
from the guilds of workmen who wandered the face of medieval Europe, but
 the spirit of Masonry walked with God before the universe was spread 
out or the scroll of the heavens unrolled. The enthusiasm of the young 
Mason is the effervescence of a pardonable pride. Let him extol the 
merits of his Craft, reciting its steady growth, its fraternal spirit, 
and its worthy undertakings. Let him boast of splendid buildings and an 
ever-increasing sphere of influence. These are the tangible evidence of 
power and should rightly set a-flutter the heart of the Apprentice who 
does not fully comprehend as yet that great strength which abides in 
silence or that unutterable dignity to be sensed only by those who. have
 been ”raised” into the contemplation of the Inner Mystery.</p>
<p>An obstacle well-nigh insurmountable is to convince the Mason himself
 that the secrets of his Craft are worthy of his profound consideration.
 As St. Paul, so we are told, kicked against the “pricks” of conversion,
 so the rank and file of present-day Masons strenuously oppose any 
effort put forth to interpret Masonic symbols in the light of 
philosophy. They are seemingly obsessed by the fear that from their 
ritualism may be extracted a meaning more profound than is actually 
contained therein. For years it has been a mooted question whether 
Freemasonry is actually a religious organization. “Masonry,” writes 
Pike, however, in the Legenda for the Nineteenth Degree, “has and always
 had a religious creed. It teaches what it deems to be the truth in 
respect to the nature and attributes of God.” The more studiously-minded
 Mason regards the Craft as an aggregation of thinkers concerned with 
the deeper mysteries of life. The all-too-prominent younger members of 
the Fraternity, however, if not openly skeptical, are at least 
indifferent to these weightier issues. The champions of philosophic 
Masonry, alas, are a weak, small voice which grows weaker and smaller as
 time goes by. In fact, there are actual blocs among the Brethren who 
would divorce Masonry from both philosophy and religion at any and all 
cost. If, however, we search the writings of eminent Masons ,we find a 
unanimity of viewpoint: namely, that Masonry is a religious and 
philosophic body. Every effort initiated to elevate Masonic thought to 
its true position has thus invariably emphasized the metaphysical and 
ethical aspects of the Craft.</p>
<p>But a superficial perusal of available documents will demonstrate 
that the modern Masonic order is not united respecting the true purpose 
for its own existence. Nor will this factor of doubt be dispelled until 
the origin of the Craft is established beyond all quibbling. The 
elements of Masonic history are strangely elusive; there are gaps which 
apparently cannot be bridged. “Who the early Freemasons really were,” 
states Gould in A Concise History of Freemasonry, “and whence they came,
 may afford a tempting theme for inquiry to the speculative antiquary. 
But it is enveloped in obscurity, and lies far outside the domain of 
authentic history.” Between modern Freemasonry with its vast body of 
ancient symbolism and those original Mysteries which first employed 
these symbols there is a dark interval of centuries. To the conservative
 Masonic historian, the deductions of such writers as Higgins, 
Churchward, Vail, and Waite – ”though ingenious and fascinating-actually
 prove nothing. That Masonry is a body of ancient lore is self-evident, 
but the tangible “link” necessary to convince the recalcitrant Brethren 
that their order is the direct successor of the pagan Mysteries has 
unfortunately not been adduced to date. Of such problems as these is 
composed the “angel” with which the Masonic Jacob must wrestle 
throughout the night.</p>
<p>It is possible to trace Masonry back a few centuries with comparative
 ease, but then the thread suddenly vanishes from sight in a maze of 
secret societies and political enterprises. Dimly silhouetted in the 
mists that becloud these tangled issues are such figures as Cagliostro, 
Comte de St.-Germain, and St. Martin, but even the connection between 
these individuals and the Craft has never been clearly defined. The 
writings of early Masonic history is involved in such obvious hazard as 
to provoke the widespread conclusion that further search is futile. The 
average Masonic student is content, therefore, to trace his Craft back 
to the workmen’s guilds who chipped and chiselled the cathedrals and 
public buildings of medieval Europe. While such men as Albert Pike have 
realized this attitude to be ridiculous, it is one thing to declare it 
insufficient and quite another to prove the fallacy to an adamantine 
mind. So much has been lot and forgotten, so much ruled in and out by 
those unfitted for such legislative revision that the modern rituals do 
not in every case represent the original rites of the Craft. In his 
Symbolism, Pike (who spent a lifetime in the quest for Masonic secrets) 
declares that few of the original meanings of the symbols are known to 
the modern order, nearly all the so-called interpretations now given 
being superficial. Pike confessed that the original meanings of the very
 symbols he himself was attempting to interpret were irretrievably – 
”lost; that even such familiar emblems as the apron and the pillars were
 locked mysteries, whose “keys” had been thrown away by the uninformed. 
“The initiated,” also writes John Fellows, “as well as those without the
 pale of the order, are equally ignorant of their derivation and import.
 (See The Mysteries of Freemasonry.)</p>
<p>Preston, Gould, Mackey, Oliver, and Pike – ”in fact, nearly every 
great historian of Freemasonry-have all admitted the possibility of the 
modern society being connected, indirectly at least, with the ancient 
Mysteries, and their descriptions of the modern society are prefaced by 
excerpts from ancient writings descriptive of primitive ceremonials. 
These eminent Masonic scholars have all recognized in the legend of 
Hiram Abiff an adaptation of the Osiris myth; nor do they deny that the 
major part of the symbolism of the craft is derived from the pagan 
institutions of antiquity when the gods were venerated in secret places 
with strange figures and appropriate rituals. Though cognizant of the 
exalted origin of their order, these historians-either through fear or 
uncertainty-have failed, however, to drive home the one point necessary 
to establish the true purpose of Freemasonry: They did not realize that 
the Mysteries whose rituals Freemasonry perpetuates were the custodians 
of a secret philosophy of life of such transcendent nature that it can 
only be entrusted to an individual tested and proved beyond all 
peradventure of human frailty. The secret schools of Greece and Egypt 
were neither fraternal nor political fundamentally, nor were their 
ideals similar to those of the modern Craft. They were essentially 
philosophic and religious institutions, and all admitted into them were 
consecrated to the service of the sovereign good. Modern Freemasons, 
however, regard their Craft primarily as neither philosophic nor 
religious, but rather as ethical. Strange as it may seem, the majority 
openly ridicule the very supernatural powers and agencies for which 
their symbols stand.</p>
<p>The secret doctrine that flows through Freemasonic symbols (and to 
whose perpetuation the invisible Masonic body is consecrated) has its 
source in three ancient and exalted orders. The first is the Dionysiac 
artificers, the second the Roman collegia, and the third the Arabian 
Rosicrucians. The Dionysians were the master builders of the ancient 
world. Originally founded to design and erect the theaters of Dionysos 
wherein were enacted the tragic dramas of the rituals, this order was 
repeatedly elevated by popular acclaim to greater dignity until at last 
it was entrusted with the planning and construction of all public 
edifices concerned with the commonwealth or the worship of the gods and 
heroes. Hiram, King of Tyre, was the patron of the Dionysians, who 
flourished in Tyre and Sidon, and Hiram Abiff (if we may believe the 
sacred account) was himself a Grand Master of this most noble order of 
pagan builders. King Solomon in his wisdom accepted the services of this
 famous craftsman, and thus at the instigation of Hiram, King of Tyre, 
Hiram Abiff, though himself a member of a different faith, journeyed 
from his own country to design and supervise the erection of the 
Everlasting House to the true God on Mount Moriah. The tools of the 
builders’ craft were first employed by the Dionysians as symbols under 
which to conceal the mysteries of the soul and the secrets of human 
regeneration. The Dionysians also first likened man to a rough ashlar 
which, trued into a finished block through the instrument of reason, 
could be fitted into the structure of that living and eternal Temple 
built without the sound of hammer, the voice of workmen or any tool of 
contention.</p>
<p>The Roman collegia was a branch of the Dionysiacs and to it belonged 
those initiated artisans who fashioned the impressive monuments whose 
ruins still lend their immortal glory to the Eternal City. In his Ten 
Books on Architecture, Vitruvius, the initiate of the collegia, has 
revealed that which was permissible concerning the secrets of his holy 
order. Of the inner mysteries, however, he could not write, for these 
were reserved for such as had donned the leather apron of the craft. In 
his consideration of the books now available concerning the Mysteries, 
the thoughtful reader should note the following words appearing in a 
twelfth-century volume entitled Artephil Liber Secretus: “Is not this an
 art full of secrets? And believest thou, O fool! that we plainly teach 
this Secret of Secrets, taking our words according to their literal 
interpretation?” (See Sephar H’ Debarim.) Into the stones they trued, 
the adepts of the collegia deeply carved their Gnostic symbols. From 
earliest times, the initiated stonecutters marked their perfected works 
with the secret emblems of their crafts and degrees that unborn 
generations might realize that the master builders of the first ages 
also labored for the same ends sought by men today.</p>
<p>The Mysteries of Egypt and Persia that had found a haven in the 
Arabian desert reached Europe by way of the Knights Templars and the 
Rosicrucians. The Temple of the Rose Cross at Damascus had preserved the
 secret philosophy of Sharon’s Rose; the Druses of the Lebanon still 
retain the mysticism of ancient Syria; and the dervishes, as they lean 
on their carved and crotched sticks, still meditate upon the secret 
instruction perpetuated from the days of the four Caliphs. From the far 
places of Irak and the hidden retreats of the Sufi mystics, the Ancient 
Wisdom thus found its way into Europe. Was Jacques de Molay burned by 
the Holy Inquisition merely because he wore the red cross of the 
Templar? What were those secrets to which he was true even in death? Did
 his companion Knights perish with him merely because they had amassed a
 fortune and exercised an unusual degree of temporal power? To the 
thoughtless, these may constitute ample grounds, but to those who can 
pierce the film of the specious and the superficial, they are assuredly 
insufficient. It was not the physical power of the Templars but the 
knowledge which they had brought with them from the East that the church
 feared. The Templars had discovered part of the Great Arcanum; they had
 become wise in those mysteries which had been celebrated in Mecca 
thousands of years before the advent of Mohammed; they had read a few 
pages from the dread book of the Anthropos, and for this knowledge they 
were doomed to die. What was the black magic of which the Templars were 
accused? What was Baphomet, the Goat of Mendes, whose mysteries they 
were declared to have celebrated? All these are questions worthy of the 
thoughtful consideration of every studious Mason.</p>
<p>Truth is eternal. The so-called revelations of Truth that come in 
different religions are actually but a re-emphasis of an ever-existing 
doctrine. Thus Moses did not originate a new religion for Israel; he 
simply adapted the Mysteries of Egypt to the needs of Israel. The ark 
triumphantly borne by the twelve tribes through the wilderness was 
copied after the Isiac ark which may still be traced in faint has-relief
 upon the ruins of the Temple of Philae. Even the two brooding cherubim 
over the mercy seat are visible in the EgyptianÂ·carving, furnishing 
indubitable evidence that the secret doctrine of Egypt was the prototype
 of Israel’s mystery religion. In his reformation of Indian philosophy, 
Buddha likewise did not reject the esotericism of the Brahmins, but 
rather adapted this esotericism to the needs of the masses in India. The
 mystic secrets locked within the holy Vedas were thus disclosed in 
order that all men, irrespective of castely distinction, might partake 
of wisdom and share in a common heritage of good. Jesus was a Rabbin of 
the Jews, a teacher of the Holy Law, who discoursed in the synagogue, 
interpreting the Torah according to the teachings of His sect. He 
brought no new message nor were His reformations radical. He merely tore
 away the veil from the temple in order that not only Pharisee and 
Sadducee but also publican and sinner might together behold the glory of
 an ageless faith.</p>
<p>In his cavern on Mount Hira, Mohammed prayed not for new truths but 
for old truths to be restated in their original purity and simplicity in
 order that men might understand again that primitive religion: God’s 
clear revelation to the first patriarchs. The Mysteries of Islam had 
been celebrated in the great black cube of the Caaba centuries before 
the holy pilgrimage. The Prophet was but the reformer of a decadent 
pagandom, the smasher of idols, the purifier of defiled Mysteries. The 
dervishes, who patterned their garmentsÂ·after those of the Prophet, 
still preserve that inner teaching of the elect, and for them the Axis 
of the Earth – ”the supreme hierophant-still sits, visible only to the 
faithful, in meditation upon the flat roof of the Caaba. Neither 
carpenter nor camel-driver, as Abdul Baha might have said, can fashion a
 world religion from the substances of his own mind. Neither prophet nor
 savior preached a doctrine which was his own, but in language suitable 
to his time and race retold that Ancient Wisdom preserved within the 
Mysteries since the dawning of human consciousness. So with the Masonic 
Mysteries of today. Each Mason has at hand those lofty principles of 
universal order upon whose certainties the faiths of mankind. have ever 
been established. Each Mason has at hand those lofty principles of 
universal order upon pregnant with life and hope to those millions who 
wander in the darkness of unenlightenment.</p>
<p>Father C. R. C., the Master of the Rose Cross, was initiated into the
 Great Work at Damcar. Later at Fez, further information was given him 
relating to the sorcery of the Arabians. From these wizards of the 
desert C. R. C. also secured the sacred book M, which is declared to 
have contained the accumulated knowledge of the world. This volume was 
translated into Latin by C. R. C. for the edification of his order, but 
only the initiates know the present hidden repository of the Rosicrucian
 manuscripts, charters, and manifestos. From the Arabians C. R. C. also 
learned of the elemental peoples and how, with their aid, it was 
possible to gain admission to the ethereal world where dwelt the genii 
and Nature spirits. C.R.C. thus discovered that the magical creatures of
 the Arabian Nights Entertainment actually existed, though invisible to 
the ordinary mortal. From astrologers living in the desert far from the 
concourse of the market-place he was further instructed concerning the 
mysteries of the stars, the virtues resident in the astral light, the 
rituals of magic and invocation, the preparation of therapeutic 
talismans, and the binding of the genii. C. R. C. became an adept n the 
gathering of medicinal herbs, the transmutation of metals, and the 
manufacture of precious gems by artificial means. Even the secret of the
 Elixir of Life and the Universal Panacea were communicated to him. 
Enriched thus beyond the dreams of Croesus, the Holy Master returned to 
Europe and there established a House of Wisdom which he called Domus 
Sancti Spiritus. This house he enveloped in clouds, it is said, so that 
men could not discover it. What are these “clouds,” however, but the 
rituals and symbols under which is concealed the Great Arcanum-that 
unspeakable mystery which every true Mason must seek if he would become 
in reality a “Prince of the Royal Secret”?</p>
<p>Paracelsus, the Swiss Hermes, was initiated into the secrets of 
alchemy in Constantinople and there beheld the consummation of the 
magnum opus. He is consequently entitled to be mentioned among those 
initiated by the Arabians into the Rosicrucian work. Cagliostro was also
 initiated by the Arabians and, because of the knowledge he had thus 
secured, incurred the displeasure of the Holy See. From the unprobed 
depths of Arabian Rosicrucianism also issued the illustrious Comte de 
St.-Germain, over whose Masonic activities to this day hangs the veil of
 impenetrable mystery. The exalted body of initiates whom he 
represented, as well as the mission he came to accomplish, have both 
been concealed from the members of the Craft at large and are apparent 
only to those few discerning Masons who sense the supernal philosophic 
destiny of their Fraternity.</p>
<p>The modern Masonic order can be traced back to a period in European 
history famous for its intrigue both political and sociological. Between
 the years 1600 and 1800, mysterious agents moved across the face of the
 Continent. The forerunner of modern thought was beginning to make its 
appearance and all Europe was passing through the throes of internal 
dissension and reconstruction. Democracy was in its infancy, yet its 
potential power was already being felt. Thrones were beginning to 
totter. The aristocracy of Europe was like the old man on Sinbad’s back:
 it was becoming more unbearable with every passing day. Although upon 
the surface national governments were seemingly able to cope with the 
situation, there was a definite undercurrent of impending change; and 
out of the masses, long patient under the yoke of oppression, were 
rising up the champions of religious, philosophic, and political 
liberty. These led the factions of the dissatisfied: people with 
legitimate grievances against the intolerance of the church and the 
oppression of the crown. Out of this struggle for expression 
materialized certain definite ideals, the same which have now come to be
 considered peculiarly Masonic.</p>
<p>The divine prerogatives of humanity were being crushed out by the 
three great powers of ignorance, superstition, and fear – ”ignorance, 
the power of the mob; fear, the power of the despot; and superstition, 
the power of the church. Between the thinker and personal liberty loomed
 the three “ruffians” or personifications of impediment-the torch, the 
crown, and the tiara. Brute force, kingly power, and ecclesiastical 
persuasion became the agents of a great oppression, the motive of a deep
 unrest, the deterrent to all progress. It was unlawful to think, 
well-nigh fatal to philosophize, rank heresy to doubt. To question the 
infallibility of the existing order was to invite the persecution of the
 church and the state. These together incited the populace, which 
thereupon played the r6le of executioner for these arch-enemies of human
 liberty. Thus the ideal of democracy assumed a definite form during 
these stormy periods of European history. This democracy was not only a 
vision but a retrospection, not only a looking forward but a gazing 
backward upon better days and the effort to project those better days 
into the unborn tomorrow. The ethical, political, and philosophical 
institutions of antiquity with their constructive effect upon the whole 
structure of the state were noble examples of possible conditions. It 
became the dream of the oppressed, consequently, to re-establish a 
golden age upon the earth, an age where the thinker could think in 
safety and the dreamer dream in peace; when the wise should lead and the
 simple follow, yet all dwell together in fraternity and industry.</p>
<p>During this period several books were in circulation which, to a 
certain degree, registered the pulse of the time. One of these documents
 – ”More’s Utopia – ”was the picture of a new age when heavenly 
conditions should prevail upon the earth. This ideal of establishing 
good in the world savored of blasphemy, however, for in that day heaven 
alone it was assumed could be good. Men did not seek to establish 
heavenly conditions upon earth, but rather earthly conditions in heaven.
 According to popular concept, the more the individual suffered the 
torments of the damned upon earth, the more he would enjoy the 
blessedness of heaven. Life was a period of chastisement and earthly 
happiness an unattainable mirage. More’s Utopia thus came as a definite 
blow to autocratic pretensions and attitudes, giving impulse to the 
material emphasis which was to follow in succeeding centuries.</p>
<p>Another prominent figure of this period was Sir Walter Raleigh, who 
paid with his life for high treason against the crown. Raleigh was tried
 and, though the charge was never proved, was executed. Before Raleigh 
went to trial, it was known that he must die and that no defense could 
save him. His treason against the crown was of a character very 
different, however, from that which history records. Raleigh was a 
member of a secret society or body of men who were already moving 
irresistibly forward under the banner of democracy, and for that 
affiliation he died a felon’s death. The actual reason for Raleigh’s 
death sentence was his refusal to reveal the identity either of that 
great political organization of which he was a member or his confreres 
who were fighting the dogma of faith and the divine right of kings. On 
the title page of the first edition of Raleigh’s History of the World, 
we accordingly find a mass of intricate emblems framed between two great
 columns. When the executioner sealed his lips forever, Raleigh’s 
silence, while it added to the discomfiture of his persecutors, assured 
the safety of his colleagues.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One of the truly great minds of
 that secret fraternity – ”in fact, the moving spirit of the whole 
enterprise-was Sir Francis Bacon, whose prophecy of the coming age forms
 the theme of his New Atlantis</strong></span> and whose vision of the 
reformation of knowledge finds expression in the Novum Organum 
Scientiarum, the new organ of science or thought. In the engraving at 
the beginning of the latter volume may be seen the little ship of 
progressivism sailing out between the Pillars of Galen and Avicenna, 
venturing forth beyond the imaginary pillars of church and state upon 
the unknown sea of human liberty. It is significant that Bacon was 
appointed by the British Crown to protect its interests in the new 
American Colonies beyond the sea. We find him writing of this new land, 
dreaming of the day when a new world and a new government of the 
philosophic elect should be established there, and scheming to 
consummate that end when the time should be ripe. Upon the title page of
 the 1640 edition of Bacon’s Advancement of Learning is a Latin motto to
 the effect that he was the third great mind since Plato. Bacon was a 
member of the same group to which Sir Walter Raleigh belonged, but 
Bacon’s position as Lord High Chancellor protected him from Raleigh’s 
fate. Every effort was made, however, to humiliate and discredit him. At
 last, in the sixty-sixth year of his life, having completed the work 
which held him in England, Bacon feigned death and passed over into 
Germany, there to guide the destinies of his philosophic and political 
fraternity for nearly twenty-five years before his actual demise.</p>
<p>Other notable characters of the period are Montaigne, Ben Jonson, 
Marlowe, and the great Franz Joseph of Transylvania – ”the latter one of
 the most important as well as active figures in all this drama, a man 
who ceased fighting Austria to retire into a monastery in Transylvania 
from which to direct the activities of his secret society. One political
 upheaval followed another, the grand climax of this political unrest 
culminating in the French Revolution, which was directly precipitated by
 the attacks upon the person of Alessandro Cagliostro. The “divine” 
Cagliostro, by far the most picturesque character of the time, has the 
distinction of being more maligned than any other person of history. 
Tried by the Inquisition for founding a Masonic lodge in the city of 
Rome, Cagliostro was sentenced to die, a sentence later commuted by the 
Pope to life imprisonment in the old castle of San Leo. Shortly after 
his incarceration, Cagliostro disappeared and the story was circulated 
that he had been strangled in an attempt to escape from prison. In 
reality, however, he was liberated and returned to his Masters in the 
East. But Cagliostro – ”the idol of France, surnamed “the Father of the 
Poor,” who never received anything from anyone and gave everything to 
everyone – ”was most adequately revenged. Though the people little 
understood this inexhaustible pitcher of bounty which poured forth 
benefits and never required replenishment, they remembered him in the 
day of their power.</p>
<p>Cagliostro founded the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry, which received 
into its mysteries many of the French nobility and was regarded 
favorably by the most learned minds of Europe. Having established the 
Egyptian Rite, Cagliostro declared himself to be an agent of the order 
of the Knights Templars and to have received initiation from them on the
 Isle of Malta. (See Morals and Dogma, in which Albert Pike quotes 
Eliphas Levi on Cagliostro’s affiliation with the Templars.) Called upon
 the carpet by the Supreme Council of France, it was demanded of 
Cagliostro that he prove by what authority he had founded a Masonic 
lodge in Paris independent of the Grand Orient. Of such surpassing 
mentality was Cagliostro that the Supreme Council found it difficult to 
secure an advocate qualified to discuss with Cagliostro philosophic 
Masonry and the ancient Mysteries he claimed to represent. The Court de 
Gebelin – ”the greatest Egyptologist of his day and an authority on 
ancient philosophies-was chosen as the outstanding scholar. A time was 
set and the Brethren convened. Attired in an Oriental coat and a pair of
 violet-colored breeches, Cagliostro was haled before this council of 
his peers. The Court de Gebelin asked three questions and then sat down,
 admitting himself disqualified to interrogate a man so much his 
superior in every branch of learning. Cagliostro then took the floor, 
revealing to the assembled Masons not only his personal qualifications, 
but prophesying the future of France. He foretold the fall of the French
 throne, the Reign of Terror, and the fall of the Bastille. At a later 
time he revealed the dates of the death of Marie Antoinette and the 
King, and also the advent of Napoleon. Having finished his address, 
Cagliostro made a spectacular exit, leaving the French Masonic lodge in 
consternation and utterly incapable of coping with the profundity of his
 reasoning. Though no longer regarded as a ritual in Freemasonry, the 
Egyptian Rite is available and all who read it will recognize its author
 to have been no more a charlatan than was Plato.</p>
<p>Then appears that charming “first American gentleman,” Dr. Benjamin 
Franklin, who together with the Marquis de Lafayette, played an 
important role in this drama of empires. While in France, Dr. Franklin 
was privileged to receive definite esoteric instruction. It is 
noteworthy that Franklin was the first in America to reprint Anderson’s 
Constitutions of the Free-Masons, which is a most prized work on the 
subject, though its accuracy is disputed. Through all this stormy 
period, these impressive figures come and go, part of a definite 
organization of political and religious thought – ”a functioning body of
 philosophers represented in Spain by no less an individual than 
Cervantes, in France by Cagliostro and St.-Germain, in Germany by 
Gichtel and Andreae, in England by Bacon, More, and Raleigh, and in 
America by Washington and Franklin. Coincident with the Baconian 
agitation in England, the Fama Fraternitatis and Confessio Fraternitatis
 appeared in Germany, both of these works being contributions to the 
establishment of a philosophic government upon the earth. One of the 
outstanding links between the Rosicrucian Mysteries of the Middle Ages 
and modern Masonry is Elias Ashmole, the historian of the Order of the 
Garter and the first Englishman to compile the alchemical writings of 
the English chemists.</p>
<p>The foregoing may seem to be a useless recital of inanities, but its 
purpose is to impress upon the reader’s mind the philosophical and 
political situation in Europe at the time of the inception of the 
Masonic order. A philosophic clan, as it were, which had moved across 
the face of Europe under such names as the “Illuminati” and the 
“Rosicrucians,” had undermined in a subtle manner the entire structure 
of regal and sacerdotal supremacy. The founders of Freemasonry were all 
men who were more or less identified with the progressive tendencies of 
their day. Mystics, philosophers, and alchemists were all bound together
 with a secret tie and dedicated to the emancipation of humanity from 
ignorance and oppression. In my researches among ancient books and 
manuscripts, I have pieced together a little story of probabilities 
which has a direct bearing upon the subject. Long before the 
establishment of Freemasonry as a fraternity, a group of mystics founded
 in Europe what was called the “Society of Unknown Philosophers.” 
Prominent among the profound thinkers who formed the membership of this 
society were the alchemists, who were engaged in transmuting the 
political and religious “base metal” of Europe into ethical and 
spiritual “gold”; the Qabbalists who, as investigators of the superior 
orders of Nature, sought to discover a stable foundation for human 
government; and lastly the astrologers who, from a study of the 
procession of the heavenly bodies, hoped to find therein the rational 
archetype for all mundane procedure. Here and there is to be found a 
character who contacted this society. By some it is believed that both 
Martin Luther and also that great mystic, Philip Melanchthon, were 
connected with it. The first edition of the King James Bible, Bible, 
which was edited by Francis Bacon and prepared under Masonic 
supervision, bears more Mason’s marks than the Cathedral of Strasburg. 
The same is true respecting the Masonic symbolism found in the first 
English edition of Josephus’ History of the Jews.</p>
<p>For some time, the Society of Unknown Philosophers moved extraneous 
to the church. Among the fathers of the church, however, were a great 
number of scholarly and intelligent men who were keenly interested in 
philosophy and ethics, prominent among them being the Jesuit Father, 
Athanasius Kircher, who is recognized as one of the great scholars of 
his day. Both a Rosicrucian and also a member of the Society of Unknown 
Philosophers, as revealed by the cryptograms in his writings, Kircher 
was in harmony with this program of philosophic reconstruction. Since 
learning was largely limited to churchmen, this body of philosophers 
soon developed an overwhelming preponderance of ecclesiastics in its 
membership. The original anti-ecclesiastical ideals of the society were 
thus speedily reduced to an innocuous state and the organization 
gradually converted into an actual auxiliary of the church. A small 
portion of the membership, however, ever maintained an aloofness from 
the literati of the faith, for it represented an unorthodox class – ”the
 alchemists, Rosicrucians, Qabbalists, and magicians. This latter group 
accordingly retired from the outer body of the society that had thus 
come to be known as the “Order of the Golden and Rose Cross” and whose 
adepts were elevated to the dignity of Knights of the Golden Stone. Upon
 the withdrawal of these initiated adepts, a powerful clerical body 
remained which possessed considerable of the ancient lore but in many 
instances lacked the “keys” by which this symbolism could be 
interpreted. As this body continued to increase in temporal power, its 
philosophical power grew correspondingly less.</p>
<p>The smaller group of adepts that had withdrawn from the order 
remained inactive apparently, having retired to what they termed the 
“House of the Holy Spirit,” where they were enveloped by certain “mists”
 impenetrable to the eyes of the profane. Among these reclusive adepts 
must be included such well-known Rosicrucians as Robert Fludd, Eugenius 
Philalethes, John Heydon, Michael Maier, and Henri Khunrath. These 
adepts in their retirement constituted a loosely organized society 
which, though lacking the solidarity of a definite fraternity, 
occasionally initiated a candidate and met annually at a specified 
place. It was the Comte de Chazal, an initiate of this order, who 
“raised” Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom while the latter was on the Isle of 
Mauritius. In due time, the original members of the order passed on, 
after first entrusting their secrets to carefully chosen successors. In 
the meantime, a group of men in England, under the leadership of such 
mystics as Ashmole and Fludd, had resolved upon repopularizing the 
ancient learning and reclassifying philosophy in accordance with Bacon’s
 plan for a world encyclopedia. These men had undertaken to reconstruct 
ancient Platonic and Gnostic mysticism, but were unable to attain their 
objective for lack of information. Elias Ashmole may have been a member 
of the European order of Rosicrucians and as such evidently knew that in
 various parts of Europe there were isolated individuals who were in 
possession of the secret doctrine handed down in unbroken line from the 
ancient Greeks and Egyptians through Boetius, the early Christian 
Church, and the Arabians.</p>
<p>The efforts of the English group to contact such individuals were 
evidently successful. Several initiated Rosicrucians were brought from 
the mainland to England, where they remained for a considerable time 
designing the symbolism of Freemasonry and incorporating into the 
rituals of the order the same divine principles and philosophy that had 
formed the inner doctrine of all great secret societies from the time of
 the Eleusinia in Greece. In fact, the Eleusinian Mysteries themselves 
continued in Christendom until the sixth century after Christ, after 
which they passed into the custody of the Arabians, as attested by the 
presence of Masonic symbols and figures upon early Mohammedan monuments.
 The adepts brought over from the Continent to sit in council with the 
English philosophers were initiates of the Arabian rites and thus 
through them the Mysteries were ultimately returned to Christendom. Upon
 completion of the by-laws of the new fraternity, the initiates retired 
again into Central Europe, leaving a group of disciples to develop the 
outer organization, which was to function as a sort of screen to conceal
 the activities of the esoteric order.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the story to be pieced together from the 
fragmentary bits of evidence available. The whole structure of 
Freemasonry is founded upon the activities of this secret society of 
Central European adepts; whom the studious Mason will find to be the 
definite “link” between the modern Craft and the Ancient Wisdom. The 
outer body of Masonic philosophy was merely the veil of this qabbalistic
 order whose members were the custodians of the true Arcanum. Does this 
inner and secret brotherhood of initiates still exist independent of the
 Freemasonic order? Evidence points to the fact that it does, for these 
august adepts are the actual preservers of those secret operative 
processes of the Greeks whereby the illumination and completion of the 
individual is effected. They are the veritable guardians of the “Lost 
Word” – ”the Keepers of the inner Mystery-and the Mason who searches for
 and discovers them is rewarded beyond all mortal estimation.</p>
<p>In the preface to a book entitled Long-Livers, published in 1772, 
Eugenius Philalethes, the Rosicrucian initiate, thus addresses his 
Brethren of the Most Ancient and Most Honorable Fraternity of the Free 
Masons: “Remember that you are the Salt of the Earth, the Light of the 
World, and the Fire of the Universe. You are living Stones, built up a 
Spiritual House, who believe and rely on the chief Lapis Angularis which
 the refractory and disobedient Builders disallowed. You are called from
 Darkness to Light; you are a chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood. 
This makes you, my dear Brethren, fit Companions for the greatest Kings;
 and no wonder, since the King of Kings hath condescended to make you so
 to himself, compared to whom the mightiest and most haughty Princes of 
the Earth are but as Worms, and that not so much as we are all Sons of 
the same One Eternal Father, by whom all Things were made; but inasmuch 
as we do the Will of his and our Father which is in Heaven. You see now 
your high Dignity; you see what you are; act accordingly, and show 
yourselves (what you are) MEN, and walk worthy the high Profession to 
which you are called. * * * . Remember, then, what the great End we all 
aim at is: Is it not to be happy here and hereafter? For they both 
depend on each other. The Seeds of that eternal Peace and Tranquillity 
and everlasting Repose must be sown in this Life; and he that would 
glorify and enjoy the Sovereign Good then must learn to do it now, and 
from contemplating the Creature gradually ascend to adore the Creator.”</p>
<p>Of all obstacles to surmount in matters of rationality, the most 
difficult is that of prejudice. Even the casual observer must realize 
that the true wealth of Freemasonry lies in its mysticism. The average 
Masonic scholar, however, is fundamentally opposed to a mystical 
interpretation of his symbols, for he shares the attitude of the modern 
mind in its general antipathy towards transcendentalism. A most 
significant fact, however, is that those Masons who have won signal 
honors for their contributions to the Craft have been transcendentalists
 almost without exception. It is quite incredible, moreover, that any 
initiated Brother, when presented with a copy of Morals and Dogma upon 
the conferment of his fourteenth degree, can read that volume and yet 
maintain that his order is not identical with the Mystery Schools of the
 first ages. Much of the writings of Albert Pike are extracted from the 
books of the French magician, Eliphas Levi, one of the greatest 
transcendentalists of modern times. Levi was an occultist, a 
metaphysician, a Platonic philosopher, who by the rituals of magic 
invoked even the spirit of Apollonius of Tyana, and yet Pike has 
inserted in his Morals and Dogma whole pages, and even chapters, 
practically verbatim. To Pike the following remarkable tribute was paid 
by Stirling Kerr, Jr., 33? Deputy for the Inspector-General for the 
District of Columbia, upon crowning with laurel the bust of Pike in the 
House of the Temple: “Pike was an oracle greater than that of Delphi. He
 was Truth’s minister and priest. His victories were those of peace. 
Long may his memory live in the hearts of the Brethren.” Affectionately 
termed “Albertus Magnus” by his admirers, Pike wrote of Hermeticism and 
alchemy and hinted at the Mysteries of the Temple. Through his zeal and 
unflagging energy, American Freemasonry was raised from comparative 
obscurity to become the most powerful organization in the land. Though 
Pike, a transcendental thinker, was the recipient of every honor that 
the Freemasonic bodies of the world could confer, the modern Mason is 
loath to admit that transcendentalism has any place in Freemasonry. This
 is an attitude filled with embarrassment and inconsistency, for 
whichever way the Mason turns he is confronted by these inescapable 
issues of philosophy and the Mysteries. Yet withal he dismisses the 
entire subject as being more or less a survival of primitive 
superstitions.</p>
<p>The Mason who would discover the Lost Word must remember, however, 
that in the first ages – ”every neophyte was a man of profound learning 
and unimpeachable character, who for the sake of wisdom and virtue had 
faced death unafraid and had triumphed over those limitations of the 
flesh which bind most mortals to the sphere of mediocrity. In those days
 the rituals were not put on by degree teams who handled candidates as 
though they were perishable commodities, but by priests deeply versed in
 the lore of their cults. Not one Freemason out of a thousand could have
 survived the initiations of the pagan rites, for the tests were given 
in those strenuous days when men were men and death the reward of 
failure. The neophyte of the Druid Mysteries was set adrift in a small 
boat to battle with the stormy sea, and unless his knowledge of natural 
law enabled him to quell the storm as did Jesus upon the Sea of Galilee,
 he returned no more. In the Egyptian rites of Serapis, it was required 
of the neophyte that he cross an unbridged chasm in the temple floor. In
 other words, if unable by magic to sustain himself in the air without 
visible support, he fell headlong into a volcanic crevice, there to die 
of heat and suffocation. In one part of the Mithraic rites, the 
candidate seeking admission to the inner sanctuary was required to pass 
through a closed door by dematerialization. The philosopher who has 
authenticated the reality of ordeals such as these no longer entertains 
the popular error that the performance of “miracles” is confined solely 
to Biblical characters. “Do you still ask,” writes Pike, “if it has its 
secrets and mysteries? It is certain that something in the Ancient 
Initiations was regarded as of immense value, by such Intellects as 
Herodotus, Plutarch and Cicero. The Magicians of Egypt were able to 
imitate several of the miracles wrought by Moses; and the Science of the
 Hierophants of the mysteries produced effects that to the Initiated 
seemed Mysterious and supernatural.” (See Legenda for the Twenty-eighth 
Degree.)</p>
<p>It becomes self-evident that he who passed successfully through these
 arduous tests involving both natural and also supernatural hazards was a
 man apart in his community. Such an initiate was deemed to be more than
 human, for he had achieved where countless ordinary mortals, having 
failed, had returned no more. Let us hear the words of Apuleius when 
admitted into the Temple of Isis, as recorded in The Metamorphosis, or 
Golden Ass: “Then also the priest, all the profane being removed, taking
 hold of me by the hand, brought me to the penetralia of the temple, 
clothed in a new linen garment. Perhaps, inquisitive reader, you will 
very anxiously ask me what was then said and done? I would tell you, if 
it could be lawfully told; you should know it, if it was lawful for you 
to hear it. But both ears and the tongue are guilty of rash curiosity. 
Nevertheless, I will not keep you in suspense with religious desire, nor
 torment you with long-continued anxiety. Hear, therefore, but believe 
what is true. I approached to the confines of death, and having trod on 
the threshold of Proserpine, I returned from it, being carried through 
all the elements. At midnight I saw the sun shining with a splendid 
light; and I manifestly drew near to the Gods beneath, and the Gods 
above, and proximately adored them. Behold, I have narrated to you 
things, of which, though heard, it is nevertheless necessary that you 
should be ignorant. I will, therefore, only relate that which may be 
enunciated to the understanding of the profane without a crime.”</p>
<p>Kings and princes paid homage to the initiate – ”the “newborn” man, 
the favorite of the gods. The initiate had actually entered into the 
presence of the divine beings. He had “died” and been “raised” again 
into the radiant sphere of everlasting light. Seekers after wisdom 
journeyed across great continents to hear his words and his sayings were
 treasured with the revelations of oracles. It was even esteemed an 
honor to receive from such a one an inclination of the head, a kindly 
smile or a gesture of approbation. Disciples gladly paid with their 
lives for the Master’s word of praise and died of a broken heart at his 
rebuke. On one occasion, Pythagoras became momentarily irritated because
 of the seeming stupidity of one of his students. The Master’s 
displeasure so preyed upon the mind of the humiliated youth that, 
drawing a knife from the folds of his garment, he committed suicide. So 
greatly moved was Pythagoras by the incident that never from that time 
on was he known to lose patience with any of his followers regardless of
 the provocation.</p>
<p>With a smile of paternal indulgence the venerable Master, who senses 
the true dignity of the mystic tie, should gravely incline the minds of 
the Brethren towards the sublimer issues of the Craft. The officer who 
would serve his lodge most effectively must realize that he is of an 
order apart from other men, that he is the keeper of an awful secret, 
that the chair upon which he sits is the seat of immortals, and that if 
he would be a worthy successor to those Master Masons of other ages, his
 thoughts must be measured by the profundity of Pythagoras and the 
lucidity of Plato. Enthroned in the radiant East, the Worshipful Master 
is the “Light” of his lodge – ”the representative of the gods, one of 
that long line of hierophants who, through the blending of their 
rational powers with the reason of the Ineffable, have been accepted 
into the Great School. This high priest after an ancient order must 
realize that those before him are not merely a gathering of properly 
tested men, but the custodians of an eternal lore, the guardians of a 
sacred truth, the perpetuators of an ageless wisdom, the consecrated 
servants of a living God, the wardens of a Supreme Mystery.</p>
<p>A new day is dawning for Freemasonry. From the insufficiency of 
theology and the hopelessness of materialism, men are turning to seek 
the God of philosophy. In this new era wherein the old order of things 
is breaking down and the individual is rising triumphant above the 
monotony of the masses, there is much work to be accomplished. The 
“Temple Builder” is needed as never before. A great reconstruction 
period is at hand; the debris of a fallen culture must be cleared away; 
the old footings must be found again that a new Temple significant of a 
new revelation of Law may be raised thereon. This is the peculiar work 
of the Builder; this is the high duty for which he was called out of the
 world; this is the noble enterprise for which he was “raised” and given
 the tools of his Craft. By thus doing his part in the reorganization of
 society, the workman may earn his “wages” as all good Masons should. A 
new light is breaking in the East, a more glorious day is at hand. The 
rule of the philosophic elect-the dream of the ages-will yet be realized
 and is not far distant. To her loyal sons, Freemasonry sends this 
clarion call: “Arise ye, the day of labor is at band; the Great Work 
awaits completion, and the days of man’s life are few.” Like the singing
 guildsman of bygone days, the Craft of the Builders marches 
victoriously down the broad avenues of Time. Their song is of labor and 
glorious endeavor; their anthem is of toil and industry; they rejoice in
 their noble destiny, for they are the Builders of cities, the Hewers of
 worlds, the Master Craftsmen of the universe!</p>

<h2><span id="What_happened_in_1813">What happened in 1813?</span></h2>
<hr><p>Who is behind the establishment of the Northern Jurisdiction? 
This will tell us much about who is behind the so-called Civil War.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On May 31,1801, the Supreme Council of the Thirty-third degree for 
the United States of America, the first Scottish Rite Supreme Council in
 the world, was founded in Charleston, South Carolina. Today’s Supreme 
Council for the Southern Masonic Jurisdiction traces its roots to this 
body. Its aim was to unify these competing groups and to bring Masonic 
order out of chaos. The full membership of this Supreme Council 
consisted of 11 Grand Inspectors General.</p>
<p>Of these 11 – John Mitchell, Frederick Dalcho, Abraham Alexander, 
Emanuel De La Motta, Thomas Bartholomew Bowen, Israel De Lieben, Isaac 
Auld, Le Comte Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, Jean Baptiste Marie
 Delahogue, Moses Clava Levy and James Moultrie — nine were born abroad 
and only Brothers Isaac Auld and James Moultrie were native born. In 
religion, four were Jews, five were Protestants, and two were Roman 
Catholics.</p>
<p>On August 5, 1813, Emanuel De La Motta, 33°, of Savannah, Georgia, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a distinguished Jewish merchant</strong></span> and philanthropist, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Grand Treasurer General of the Supreme Council at Charleston</strong></span>,
 organized in New York City the Supreme Council of the Thirty-third 
degree for the Northern District and Jurisdiction of the United States 
of America.</p>
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
<p>Both the Northern and the Southern Jurisdictions made slow progress 
in unifying the scattered degree-conferring groups, and in standardizing
 the rituals. They were handicapped by the pride in the local 
organizations; by leadership jealousies; by the anti-Masonic agitation 
of 1826-40, which almost destroyed Freemasonry; by the War between the 
States, and by other matters. The process of unification, however, was 
completed in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction by the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Union of 1867</strong></span>,
 when the last irregular Supreme Council finally acknowledged the 
authority of the regular Supreme Council. From that Union, there arose 
what is the present Supreme Council for the Northern Masonic 
jurisdiction of the United States of America.</p>

<p>In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath was sent by a group of Scottish 
nobles to the Pope affirming Scottish independence from England. Two 
similar declarations were also sent by the nobles, clergy and Robert I. 
In 1324, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray was sent to meet the Pope in 
person at his court in Avignon. Randoph successfully persuaded Pope John
 to recognize Robert as King of Scots, a major diplomatic coup. In 1327,
 Edward II of England was deposed and killed and his son Edward III of 
England assumed the throne. Repeated invasions of the north of England 
by Robert or his war leaders, culminating in the Battle of Stanhope 
Park, in which the English king was nearly captured, forced Edward III 
to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1 May 1328</strong></span>.
 This recognised the independence of Scotland and Robert the Bruce as 
King. To further seal the peace, Robert’s son and heir David married the
 sister of Edward III.</p>

<p>It is impossible to know if the designers of the Georgia Guidestones 
made such a connection. I would feel better about mentioning it if I 
could look up the etymology of the word <em>jam</em> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://www.oed.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OED</a>, but <em>I am not going to pay $90 (sale price) to look up one word.</em>
 If their earliest use is 1706, then I would be much more confident is 
suggesting this is part of the meaning on the cube because it is most 
definitely befitting the occasion. So much so that I just had to include
 this note.</p>

<hr><blockquote>
<p>The main thing historians in Wolfenbüttel knew about the group was 
that it was led by a count named Friedrich August von Veltheim, who died
 in April 1775. Like many aristocrats of his day, he belonged to 
multiple secret societies, including an Order of the Golden Poodles, 
which likely sounded as goofy back then as it does today. But in his 
will, his Oculist heirlooms merited special instructions. He had locked 
all of the Oculists’ objects in a leather trunk and ordered his son to 
make sure the seals remained unbroken until the local duke (or one of 
the duke’s descendants) said otherwise.</p>
<p class="citation">Wired.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190005/https://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-the-manuscript/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>They Cracked This 250-Year-Old Code, and Found a Secret Society</em></a> by Noah Shachtman, November 16, 2012</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Note that Friedrich August von Veltheim died the year before the establishment of the Illuminati.</strong></span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the midst of the descriptions about Oculist rituals, the document 
took a narrative turn. It described a meeting of “a few good friends” 
who talked about people’s desire to “know something only because it 
needs to be kept secret.” The friends decided to use this curiosity to 
play a little prank. They set up a fraternity and “would agree 
immediately as they would like to pretend that a great secret would be 
behind their unification.” They called this farce, this hoax, this grand
 psychological experiment Freemasonry. In other words, the Oculists were
 making an outrageous claim: that they founded Freemasonry … as a joke.</p>
<p>That certainly wasn’t true, but at the very least the Oculists seemed
 to be watching Freemasonry’s every move. Starting on page 27 and 
continuing for the remaining 78 pages, the cipher detailed the rituals 
performed by the highest degrees of the Masonic order—rites unknown to 
ordinary Masons at the time. Nothing was omitted from the Copiale’s 
descriptions of these top-level rituals. Not the skulls. Not the 
coffins. Not removal of undergarments nor the nooses nor the veneration 
of Hiram Abiff, builder of the Great Temple of Jerusalem, whose 
decomposed body became the alchemical emblem for turning something 
rotten into something miraculous and golden.</p>

<hr><p>Both the World Trade Center and the Masonic Temple were destroyed
 to send a message. In the case of the World Trade Center, the 322 
numeric signature is further evidence that the building was designed to 
be destroyed. This is what men do who are waiting for the end of the 
world.</p>
<p>The rationale for such drastic measures is simple, and also stated on
 my homepage. The progeny of Jove live for one day and one day only. <em>All of history awaits this one day</em>.
 Everything else in the entire history of the world as you know it pales
 in significance. On this “day of the Lord” as the Bible calls it, a 
Pacific Ocean megatsunami over two miles high will wash over the 
continental United States of America and erase everything and everybody 
you have known your entire life. On that day, the United States of 
America will enter into the realm of myth. This is the reality of the 
Georgia Guidestones, nothing less.</p>
