 First off, the work on the Federal Reserve System sections was abruptly
 halted ages ago and I have not looked at it sense. Because of this, I 
created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/central/#best-of-breed-federal-reserve-system-youtube">Best of Breed Federal Reserve System YouTube</a>
 until I finish my own work. The sections on the Rothschilds are new and
 under development. The stuff on the Rothschilds is new and under 
development.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: September 29, 2020</p>

<p>You cannot fully understand the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/progeny/">progeny of Jove</a>
 in modern times without first understanding the role of central banks 
and the Federal Reserve System in particular is the worldwide 
enslavement of the working classes. Central banks are the legitimized 
financial arm of the European Order of Illuminati, which has long since 
morphed into the Supreme Council 33° N.M. J., the CIA, and now exists as
 an “Unnamed Entity” well hidden behind need-to-know clearances that

 New York&nbsp;“show a group of noblemen and hunters in pursuit of a 
unicorn through an idealised French landscape.”&nbsp; This is correct, 
but fails to understand the symbolism. Tapestry 5 in particular portrays
 the end time, with the European Illuminati making sport of the deluded 
masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 36px;">For the progeny of Jove, the unicorn has always represented the fairy tale world in which the masses live.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">There are nine men representing the 
progeny of Jove. There are 13 dogs attacking the Unicorn. The symbolism 
is unmistakable. This tapestry was made by a family who is a part of the
 progeny of Jove and then carefully stored to preserve it for the end 
times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">We are being inundated with Unicorns 
right before the end. Why? I am always trying to cultivate in my readers
 an imagination sufficient to grasp the full dimension of what is 
happening right now in the world. The mundane mind resists the sheer

<p>From what I know from having studied the progeny of Jove, including the Illuminati for over five years now, is that <strong>this is exactly the kind of ridicule they love to thrust onto the masses</strong>.
 I do not doubt for a second that this flood of unicorns (I had one at 
my door last night for Halloween) is a very deliberate mocking gesture, 
one that only reinforces my sense that we are on the verge of something 
unimaginable.</p>
<p>If you are aware of or concerned about the intentional dumbing down 
of the masses, you really want to watch this Truthstream Media video:</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">Don’t stop now. You are on the verge of a major breakthrough</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">A question of paramount importance must now be asked</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why is there a unicorn (supporter)&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Rothschild coat of arms?</span></strong></p>
<p>(A “supporter” is a technical term&nbsp;for&nbsp;heraldry.) Wikipedia has an interesting page entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Coats_of_arms_with_unicorns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Pages in category “Coats of arms with unicorns”</a>. The Rothschild coat of arms is clearly a throwback to the&nbsp;Royal coat of arms of Great Britain.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7002" data-permalink="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/dumb/royal-coat-of-arms-of-great-britain/" data-orig-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain.png" data-orig-size="480,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Royal coat of arms of Great Britain" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain.png" data-large-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain.png" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-7002 aligncenter" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain.png" alt="" width="480" height="480" srcset="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain.png 480w, %E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/Royal-coat-of-arms-of-Great-Britain-432x432.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>But this still begs the question, Why? There is no such animal in 
reality. What are the designers of these coats of arms saying by 
including one in their&nbsp;heraldry? If you watched Nathan Hoffman’s 
video, I think you have sufficient information to answer this question 
for yourself. The&nbsp;Royal coat of arms of Great Britain was designed 
only a few years before the Freemasons were created in 1717.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">The
 progeny of Jove are mocking Christianity. The unicorn “supports” their 
shield because they believe Christianity is delusional. On the other 
side of these shields is a lion. Few people understand as did Manly P. 
Hall that from a heliocentric perspective, which is the perspective of 
the progeny of Jove, that we are not in the Age of Aquarius, but the 
exact opposite. We are in the Age of Leo. It is in the Age of Leo that 
earth is destroyed. The lion represents the physical assault on the 
masses. The unicorn represents the intellectual assault.</p>
<p>It is the same old problem. As discussed on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/sacred-numbers/">Sacred Numbers and Tracking the Progeny of Jove</a>
 page, the Pythagoreans&nbsp;cannot see that there is a conscious entity
 behind the sacred numbers. They can only conceive of their own, haughty
 intelligence. And for reasons I try, <em>perhaps in vain</em>, to describe on the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/abomination-of-desolation/">Matthew 24:15-18 (the last sign before the end)</a> page, these men become “beasts” in the end time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a natural consequence of lesser mortals coming into direct contact with sure knowledge of the end times</span>.
 I bury my religious stuff pretty deep, but it is where I started. I 
began writing when I first perceived that there was science behind what 
Christ Jesus says in Matthew 24. Specifically, I could see that his 
mention of massive lightning (such as is reported daily in the news) in 
the end times was related to an increase in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) 
flux. See&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/gcr/#galactic-cosmic-rays-cause-lightning">Galactic Cosmic Rays Cause Lightning</a>
 for a discussion. The point is, this unicorn onslaught is yet another 
sign that we are in the end time. These people know. They are using 
their control of the markets to drown us in symbolism that is for them 
300 years old. Why now? It is what it appears to be, a celebration of 
the end times.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 36px;">While I was working on this 
very section, the doorbell rang. It was three young children. One of 
them was a little girl came dressed as a unicorn. It was Halloween night
 2019. I smiles as always and greeted them.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #000000;">Little did her parents know. I thought about her future for a moment and then returned to work on An Apocalyptic Synthesis.</span></p>

<hr><p>I think this video is the most balanced I have ever seen. There 
are a countless number of them. I am encouraged that my choice was a 
good one because the account was “terminated because we received 
multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement regarding material
 the user posted.” This is happening with increasingly greater frequency
 either because of censorship or because private businesses are now 
competing with YouTube for business. I for one refuse to subscribe to 
any of them.</p>
<p>I spend countless hours searching for best of breed YouTube videos. 
When the problem of disappearing YouTube videos began to have a huge 
impact on my work, I learned to copy the video before even posting a 
link to the original on my website. Some of these videos, including the 
one you are about to watch, require countless hours of toil to produce. 
They are rare because it requires not only someone who has an insightful
 perspective on what is happening, but who is also talented at producing
 videos. I can tell you from firsthand experience, that is not a skill 
easily acquired.&nbsp; Now when a video such as this one disappears, I 
just use the copy and the original attribution. This is a long video, 
but you need to understand the Federal Reserve. It is the muscle of the 
European Illuminati.</p>

and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of 
commerce among individuals. Industry is increased, commodities are 
multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist 
the true wealth and prosperity of a state.</p>
<p>Most commercial nations have found it necessary to institute banks and they have proved to be <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the happiest engines, that ever were invented for advancing trade</strong></span>.
 Venice Genoa Hamburgh Holland and England are examples of their 
utility. They owe their riches, commerce and the figure they have made 
at different periods in a great degree to this source. Great Britain is 
indebted for the immense efforts she has been able to make in so many 
illustrious and successful wars essentially to that vast fabric of 
credit raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone she now menaces our 
independence.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: “The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her

or simply the Chancellor, is a senior official within the Government of 
the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty’s Treasury. The office is a 
British Cabinet-level position.”&nbsp; —Wikipedia,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.
 In other words, at the time he spoke these words, William Pit was 
“Secretary of Treasury” for Britain, the counterpart of Alexander 
Hamilton. But this is very misleading because in truth <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>William Pit was the Andrew Jackson of England</strong></span>.</p>

 imagine ourselves more civilized than the ancient peoples of Central

 that mankind has safely departed the Kali Yuga (or Iron Age), and is 
headed toward a brighter future is grotesquely deluded and mesmerized by
 a few technological trinkets.</span></strong> The clock just struck 
midnight according to the ancients, less than a month ago at the time of
 this writing. Such&nbsp;gullible people cannot see what is really 
happening. Everyday hundreds and thousands are sacrificed on the alter 
of the progeny of Jove’s agenda. We are the walking dead to them. This 
central bank timeline leads straight to the Civil War in which an 
estimated 620,000 men lost their lives. About another 20 million died in
 WWI. And an estimated 70-85 million died in WWII. All of these were 
sacrifices to the gods of our overlords, the progeny of Jove. If you 
knew and understood how consciously these men and woman were sent to 
their deaths, you would understand that the clock really just strike 
midnight on the Yuga cycle. And it does not start upwards until after 
the apocalypse. Now comes the really hard part. Your mind will deflect 
what I am about to say. You will dismiss it as if you did not even read 
the words. Nevertheless it must be said.</big></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">Once
 you understand that the modern&nbsp;modus operandi of human sacrifice 
is more barbaric and savage than anything that was ever done in Central 
America, you are ready to wrap yourself around the reality of pedophilia
 in England and the United States of America. That’s right. There is a 
direct connection between central banks and pedophilia. The former is a 
training ground for learning how to disregard the humanity of your 
fellow human beings. The latter is a right of passage for those in 
possession of the certain knowledge of what is about to happen. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Just
 because we have learned to live with these animals and our bookshelves 
are full of their dissertations on how to refine the financial abuses 
Andrew Jackson tried so hard to stop, doesn’t change the fact that these
 are monstrous, vile human beings.</strong></span> Writing the section on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/illuminati/#rampant-pedophilia">Rampant Pedophilia</a>
 was unimaginably horrific for me. The least you can do is read it. The 
banksters of this world rape our children and, whether you choose to 
believe it or not doesn’t change the fact, do sacrifice the lives of 
children. Both practices are rights of passage for the progeny of Jove 
in these end times. Walk away if you can. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Tell yourself whatever lie is necessary.</strong></span> But I cannot hide the reality of what is happening.</p>
<p><big>You and I are alive at the worst possible time. The only 
mitigating factor from where I stand is that we are the generation that 
witnesses what the Bible calls the “day of the Lord.” And if you have 
any faith in the afterlife, that’s no small compensation for a few short
 years on this dreary planet.&nbsp;</big></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The Bank of North America pictured above was the&nbsp;first de facto central bank in the United States</p>
<p><big><strong>What follows is a timeline for central banks in the United States of America…</strong></big></p>
<p><span style="text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 2; font-weight: 600; font-family: 'Lucida Sans Typewriter', 'Lucida Console', monaco, 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', monospace;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">APRIL 19, 1775 TO&nbsp;SEPTEMBER 3, 1783</span>, AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR</span></p>
<p>Why is the American Revolutionary War the first entry in a timeline 
for central banks? Because the second entry is that the Bank of North 
America is approved by congress. There is a pattern of financial panic 
followed by a new central bank that continues from this time until the 
Federal Reserve system is created. Lacking a central bank to fabricate a
 financial panic in these early years of the United States, war is the 
only option. The progeny of Jove are consummate, brilliant planners. 
Hardly anything happens in history that they did not intend to happen. 
In fact, Christ Jesus and Christianity is the only example that come 
readily to mind. In the case, the took the “if you can’t beat’em, 
join’em” tack when Constantine the Great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/romans/">bastardized Christianity</a> and later when the Jesuits too control of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>To understand what is happening at this juncture in history, you must
 know that the highly unusual Pikes Peak granite batholith in the Front 
Range was chosen as the last refuge of the progeny of Jove, or what 
Virgil called the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/vault/">vault profound</a>”
 thousands of years ago. American independence from Great Britain was 
never in question. Everything is happening by design. This includes 
everything from Great Britain “losing” the American Revolutionary War to
 the Confederate losses at the&nbsp;Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

 sign of good faith to Federalists and the new bank and Hamilton made 
public endorsement of the establishment under his pseudonym.</span></p>
<p><strong>Public offering </strong></p>
<p>William Bingham’s first daughter, Ann Louisa Baring, was born the day
 before the bank opened, and her father purchased 9.5% of the shares for
 himself. She was also the granddaughter of Thomas Willing, a primary 
shareholder and the original President of the bank offices at 
Philadelphia. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Using a gift/loan from France, Robert Morris purchased 63.3% of the original shares for the government.</strong></span>
 Robert Morris deposited large quantities of gold and silver coin and

the national debt through the issuance of federal bank notes. Modeled on
 the Bank of England, this privately held, but publicly funded 
institution would also serve to process revenue fees and perform fiscal 
duties for the federal government. Secretary Hamilton regarded the bank 
as indispensable to producing a stable and flexible financial 
system.&nbsp; &nbsp;—Wikipedia,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Report_on_Public_Credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Second Report on Public Credit</a>&nbsp;[<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>bold-red</strong></span> emphasis added]</p>

<p>And this is relevant to a central bank timeline why? Because I admire the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/creighton-osborn/">Scott Creighton and Gary Osborn</a>.
 I believe their research is critical to understanding both the design 
of the Great Pyramid of Giza and the history of the progeny of Jove 
during the time they were building the great cathedrals and painting the
 old masterworks. The point of mentioning L’enfant’s plan for what would
 become Washington, D.C. is to show the power of the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council,_Scottish_Rite_(Southern_Jurisdiction,_USA)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Supreme Council, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA</a> (commonly known as the Mother Supreme Council of the World).&nbsp;You can see this for yourself by watching the first <strong>2:32</strong> minutes of the following video.&nbsp;Here it is worth noting that L’enfant was a Freemason, as discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://scottishrite.org/about/media-publications/journal/article/the-masonic-career-of-major-pierre-charles-lenfant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Masonic Career of Major Pierre Charles L’Enfant</a>.
 At his time in history, the Freemasons are still the progeny of Jove in
 their day. They are infiltrated by the Illuminati, but I argue this was
 always meant to be. The Freemasons of the South were destined to be 
Founding Fathers of the United States of America, but the Illuminati 
were meant to rule over it and the world in the end times. The 
difference between the two groups of men is the difference between the 
love of knowledge and the love of power and money. If there is a third, 
controlling entity (which I call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/nine/">The Nine</a>),
 they not only sanctioned this transition, they anticipated it thousands
 of years ago. It is the nature of the beast. In the ends times, a 
brutal instinct would be necessary to achieve the goals of the progeny 
of Jove (such as the extinction of the Jewish race, for example).</p>

<p>In about 20 years, the power of the Freemasons in the South would 
start to wane and continue to due so until they are fully subjugated to 
the Illuminati posing as Freemasons in the North. Of course, when I say 
things like this, I am not referring to the rank and file. They never 
know anything. It is the leadership of which I am speaking. It is a huge
 change, and it is what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> are all about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><big>Expiration of charter</big></strong></p>
<p>After Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury
 Oliver Wolcott, Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state 
of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved 
either by selling the government’s shares of stock in the bank or by 
raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly 
agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock 
had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to 
retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure 
but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank’s charter. 
Vice President George Clinton broke the tie and voted against renewal. 
The bank’s charter thus expired in 1811.&nbsp; —Wikipedia,&nbsp;First

<p>The Second Bank has been in operation for 13 years. There is another 
seven years before its charter expires in January 1836. Andrew Jackson 
is the seventh U.S. President, but more importantly he is the third <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/presidents/">Freemason President</a>.
 He is the&nbsp;quintessential Freemason of the South, a natural born 
leader of the highest character. For the country, this time in the 
history of the United States of America represents the road not taken, 
for Andrew Jackson will win the Bank War but the forces at work here are
 not unlike the two or three mile high megatsunami waves that will very 
soon wash across North America. <em>They cannot be stopped.</em> 
Likewise, the Freemasons of the South will soon loose their country to 
the Illuminati in the Civil War, which war i would characterize as the 
ultimate expression of the power conferred upon the progeny of Jove by 
their certain knowledge of what is about to happen. They do not wince 
while slaughtering 620,000 men in order to wrestle control of the 
federal government from the Freemasons of the South. Ultimately, perhaps
 unknown even to this day by the men who designed the Georgia 
Guidestones, what is happening here is a changing of the guard. The 
Freemasons of the South are a special lineage within the progeny of 
Jove. Their purpose was to found the United States of America. Within 
the original Freemasons specific knowledge of the end times was only 
ever shared with the highest ranking Freemasons and only then on a 
need-to-know basis. <em>By the time of President Andrew Jackson their mission is completed.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Now a less noble breed of men are needed. We call these men the Illuminati.</strong> </span>The
 Freemason lineage&nbsp;is about to come to an end in the aftermath of 
the Civil War. What I never realized, however, until I started to study 
the Georgia Guidestones, was that this demarcation was not as clean as 
those on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/progeny/">progeny of Jove</a>
 page that I generally describe&nbsp;as a “beheading” of the previous 
organizational entity. Some men with a specific&nbsp;knowledge of the 
end times were left behind in the South after the end of the Civil War. 
Unlike the Illuminati who have been working at a frantic pace to prepare
 (they call it providence, a word few people know has two distinct 
meanings) for the coming apocalypse, these men have had the leisure to 
reflect on what is happening in the here and now. Their statement, 
twenty years in the making and I believe perhaps much longer, is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a>.</p>

<p>The United States of America is to become one big money making 
machine in order to finance the work on the extensive tunnel systems in 
the Pikes Peak granite as well as all of physical plant starting with 
the Cheesman Dam and ending with the Denver International Airport, the 
of the Front Range while maintaining control of the entire world.</p>
<p>But in this brief time to which I think the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://amallulla.com/guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a>
 are alluding, we get a glimpse of what could have been. What few minds 
can even glimpse, is that this road not taken has been the story of the 
Fifth World. The decision of the progeny of Jove to exclude the masses 
from the knowledge of the coming destruction of the world was, in my 
mind, a fundamental mistake. While I can respect what they are trying to
 do, I would argue fervently that had they told everyone thousands of 
years ago, we could have been off the planet by now. Instead, everything
 hinges on the integrity of the extensive tunnels systems in the Pikes 
Peak granite of the Front Range. They glory as did Virgil when he cried 
out “<em>All, see, enraptured of the coming time!</em>,” but in truth 
theirs is a stupid gamble. I say again, it is self-evident that we could
 have been off the planet. Yes, there would have been perilous times 
with everyone know their days are limited, but what difference would 
that make for bases on the Moon or Mars? I wish you men could know that I
 am not making this up. The message that your tunnel are going to fail 
has become who and what I am. It was the first thing that came to me, 
ahead of everything else. That is precisely how I know it is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the 
constitutional power “to coin money and regulate the value thereof.” 
Congress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to 
regulate the value thereof. The money so coined, with its value so 
regulated, and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only 
currency known to the Constitution.&nbsp;<b><span style="color: #ff0000;">But
 if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to 
be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation</span>.</b>&nbsp;If
 the bank be established for that purpose, with a charter unalterable 
without its consent, Congress have parted with their power for a term of
 years, during which the Constitution is a dead letter. It is neither 
necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank, 
and therefore unconstitutional.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the 
acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society 
will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of 
education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In 
the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior 
industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to 
protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural 
and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, 
gratuities, and exclusive privileges, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful</strong></span>,
 the humble members of society — the farmers, mechanics, and laborers — 
who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to 
themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their 
government. There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist 
only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal protection, and,
 as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the 
low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.</p>

<p>This is the original, which includes that text. It is strangely 
difficult to find. Not even Wikipedia has it. I found it at long last 
on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://tnsoshistory.com/chapter5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tennessee Blue Book: A History of Tennessee – Student Edition</a>, Tennessee State Library and Archives Education Outreach Program</p>
<p><big>There were a plethora of vicious political cartoons publicly 
lampooning&nbsp;President Andrew Jackson in his time, but none evidenced
 their motive of character assassination more than this own.</big></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">This
 is in my mind, a perfect example of what I call the “law of opposites” 
on my homepage. President Jackson is seen here standing on a copy of 
the&nbsp;Constitution of United States of America, which he more than 
once risked his life to defend. Why? Because he does not think a private
 corporation such as is The Federal Reserve System is constitutional. 
Anybody who doubts this should try to find the law requiring United 
States citizens to pay an income tax.</p>

<p>Gentlemen! I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank
 of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time, and 
am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in 
the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits 
amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me 
that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall 
ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is 
your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families,
 and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have 
determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, (bringing his fist down 
on the table) I will rout you out!</p>

<p>Events have satisfied my mind, and I think the minds of the American people, that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the mischiefs and dangers which flow from a national bank far over-balance all its advantages</strong></span>.
 The bold effort the present bank has made to control the Government, 
the distresses it has wantonly produced, the violence of which it has 
been the occasion in one of our cities famed for its observance of law 
and order, are but <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>premonitions of
 the fate which awaits the American people should they be deluded into a
 perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like 
it</strong></span>. —President Andrew Jackson</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country 
when the Bank of the United States waged war upon the people in order to
 compel them to submit to its demands can not yet be forgotten. The 
ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities and communities 
were oppressed, individuals impoverished and ruined, and a scene of 
cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency 
ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the 
United States. If such was its power in a time of peace, what would it 
not have been in a season of war, with an enemy at your doors? No nation
 but the freemen of the United States could have come out victorious 
from such a contest; yet, if you had not conquered, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the
 Government would have passed from the hands of the many to the hands of
 the few, and this organized money power from its secret conclave would 
have dictated the choice of your highest officers and compelled you to 
make peace or war, as best suited their own wishes</strong></span>. The forms of your Government might for a time have remained, but its living spirit would have departed from it.</p>
<p>The distress and sufferings inflicted on the people by the bank are 
some of the fruits of that system of policy which is continually 
striving to enlarge the authority of the Federal Government beyond the 
limits fixed by the Constitution. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The
 powers enumerated in that instrument do not confer on Congress the 
right to establish such a corporation as the Bank of the United State</strong></span>s,
 and the evil consequences which followed may warn us of the danger of 
departing from the true rule of construction and of permitting temporary
 circumstances or the hope of better promoting the public welfare to 
influence in any degree our decisions upon the extent of the authority 
of the General Government. Let us abide by the Constitution as it is 
written, or amend it in the constitutional mode if it is found to be 
defective.</p>
<p>The severe lessons of experience will, I doubt not, be sufficient to 
prevent Congress from again chartering such a monopoly, even if the 
Constitution did not present an insuperable objection to it. But you 
must remember, my fellow-citizens, that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing</strong></span>.</p>

<p>We failed President Andrew Jackson. We failed the hero of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Battle of New Orleans</a> which ended the War of 1812.</p>
<p>Here an important question must be asked. Who is Andrew Jackson 
fighting? Is his enemy Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of 
Treasury? All three of Alexander Hamilton’s most important detractors, 
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and U.S. Attorney General Edmund 
Randolph, were from Virginia (i.e. the South). He was a lawyer from New 
York. Was Alexander Hamilton somehow connected to an Illuminati plot to 
use the power of a central bank to take control of the United States of 
America? I think not. Freemasons historians are adamant that he was not 
one of their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;"><b style="font-size: large; font-style: italic;">President
 Jackson is objecting to privatizing the national bank. He was fighting 
the good fight. But he is also fighting a losing battle. The progeny of 
Jove are readying themselves to take control of the country. The James 
Buchanan presidency is a mere 25 years into the future. <span style="color: #ff0000;">What
 you are seeing here is about to be characterized as the “final salvo of
 the Bank War,” but in reality it is the opening salvo of the Civil War,
 the consolidation of wealth and power in the North.</span> The first 
U.S. Attorney General Edmund Randolph (1789-1794) and three Presidents 
of the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson (1801 to 1809), James 
Madison (1809 to 1817),&nbsp;and Andrew Jackson (1829-1832) could see 
what was happening and tried </b><span style="font-size: large;"><b><i>unsuccessfully</i></b></span><b style="font-size: large; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;to stop it. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nothing and nobody can impede the progress of the progeny of Jove in their march toward the New World.</span>&nbsp;If
 you don’t understand the power of the knowledge they possess, you will 
never understand the history of the Untied States of America. Theirs is a
 mandate from the God of Pythagoras. We are all Andrew Jackson. God love
 him for trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

 most important accomplishments as a member of the legislature consisted
 in the introduction of two seminal bills. One established a public 
schooling system in Pennsylvania. the other won the renewal of the 
charter for the Bank of the United States, which initiated his career in
 the financial realm of U.S. politics. His participation in national 
banking was curtailed through the War of 1812, during which time Biddle 
served as a member of the state senate. In 1819, the Bank of the United 
States was re-chartered and President James Monroe appointed Biddle to 
the position of Government Director. The president of the bank resigned 
shortly thereafter, and Biddle assumed the office in 1822. He served as 
President of the Bank until 1839. The bill to re-charter the bank was 
vetoed in 1832 be president Andrew Jackson who opposed the bank. In 
order to undermine the credibility of the bank, Jackson withdrew all the
 government deposits in 1833, which had repercussions throughout the 
national economy. He continued his bank war through another recession in
 1837 until 1839, when Biddle resigned as President of the Bank, and the
 Bank failed completely in 1841.</p>

<p>A renaissance man accomplished in literature as well as finance, 
Biddle was the country’s first central banker, and he was a master of 
his craft. Under his firm direction, the Second Bank grew into a 
powerful instrument of monetary stability, the rock upon which a decade 
of robust economic growth was built. But for all his financial 
brilliance and managerial skill, Biddle had faults that proved to be 
fatal for the Bank and his career. Arrogant, hypersensitive to criticism
 and unschooled in politics, he failed when put to the test during the 
vitriolic battle between Biddle and President Andrew Jackson over the 
rechartering of the Bank.</p>
<p>Few who met Biddle as a young man doubted that he would go far. Son 
of a successful Philadelphia merchant, he graduated from Princeton 
University at the age of 15, at the top of his class. While still a 
teenager, he served as secretary to the U.S. minister to Napoleonic 
France, working on the financial details of the Louisiana Purchase. 
Later he was secretary to James Monroe, the U.S. minister in Britain and
 future president. Admitted to the bar, he showed more interest in 
letters than the law, preparing the journals of the Lewis and Clark 
expedition for publication and editing the Port Folio, an influential 
literary magazine. Marriage to an heiress allowed him to indulge his 
fascination with ancient Greek culture on a huge estate outside 
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Biddle was also interested in banking and the economy. In 1811, as a 
newly elected member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, he spoke in favor 
of a new federal charter for the First Bank of the United States, which 
many state lawmakers opposed. In a speech that has been called “the 
maturest expression of banking knowledge to be found in America in that 
period,”<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a><a id="n2" name="n2"></a>&nbsp;Biddle
 argued that the First Bank was constitutional and crucial to the 
economy as a repository of wealth and issuer of uniform currency.</p>
<p>The speech established him as an authority on banking, currency and 
government finance, and when in 1819 President Monroe was looking for a 
new government director to help manage the troubled Second Bank, he 
picked Biddle, his former secretary and friend. Bright, strong-willed 
and articulate, Biddle quickly became one of the Bank’s most influential
 directors. Committed now to a career in finance instead of literature, 
he quipped in a verse written for a young admirer that: “I prefer my 
last letter from Barings or Hope/to the finest epistles of Pliny or 
Pope.”<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a><a id="n3" name="n3"></a></p>
<p>Biddle became president at age 37—younger than most of the directors 
who elected him—and immediately put into action his plan for developing 
the Bank into a great balance wheel of the monetary system. Biddle was 
“the prototype of the modern business executive,”<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;<a id="n4" name="n4"></a>a manager who could both formulate bold ideas and execute them by delegating to handpicked subordinates.</p>
<p>Those talents proved inadequate, however, when Biddle was thrown into
 the political cauldron that Jackson stirred up during the Bank War. He 
had personality flaws that worsened the conflict and drove him to take 
extreme measures to save the Bank. Biddle was excitable, self-important 
and compulsively defensive about the Bank and his image. “[H]is feelings
 never got the better of his manners but often marred his judgment,” 
said banking historian Bray Hammond.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a><a id="n5" name="n5"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, he was politically inept, overplaying his hand at pivotal moments of his struggle with Jackson.</p>
<p>Biddle exasperated the president by his repeated refusal to seriously
 investigate charges of political interference by some Bank branches 
during the 1828 elections. And he squandered what might have been 
opportunities for rapprochement with Jackson, brushing off his 
allegations against the Bank and antagonizing him by pressing ahead with
 recharter in 1832.</p>
<p>Stubbornness spilled over into recklessness at the climax of the Bank
 War, when Biddle used the Bank as an economic weapon and made 
inflammatory remarks about Jackson. “This worthy President thinks that 
because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned Judges, he is to have his 
way with the Bank,” Biddle wrote to a federal judge in February 1834.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a><a id="n6" name="n6"></a>&nbsp;By
 the fall of that year, Biddle was so reviled for his nationwide 
curtailment of credit that he was hunted by mobs in Philadelphia, 
forcing him to bar the doors of his house and post armed guards.</p>
<p>Arguably, a more temperate and politically astute leader of the 
Second Bank would have found common ground with Jackson, resulting in a 
peaceful end to the Bank War and renewal of the Bank’s charter. It’s 
conceivable that if not for Biddle, the Bank would have stayed in 
business for decades, altering the course of banking history.</p>
<p>We’ll never know, of course; the Second Bank was destroyed, and out 
of its ashes Biddle formed the U.S. Bank of Pennsylvania, a commercial 
bank run under a state charter. In private banking, Biddle could not 
replicate the success and adulation he had enjoyed as a central banker. 
As president of the Pennsylvania bank, Biddle authorized risky loans and
 investments, and hatched a dubious plan to use bank funds to corner the
 market on cotton. After Biddle retired in 1839—briefly pursuing the 
U.S. presidency as a Whig running against Martin Van Buren—he and other 
former officers of the bank were indicted for fraud and theft in 
connection with the cotton scheme. The charges were dismissed, but 
creditors had lost faith in the bank, and it failed in the Depression of
 1839–43.</p>
<p>The collapse of the bank consumed Biddle’s personal fortune and what 
remained of his reputation. Broke and shunned by old friends and 
associates, he retreated to his wife’s estate, where he died at the age 
of 58—heartbroken, according to his biographer, at the loss of the bank 
and his fall from grace.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-rise-and-fall-of-nicholas-biddle#fn7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a><a id="n7" name="n7"></a></p>

<p><big><strong>1836-1865: The Free Banking Era</strong></big></p>
<p>State-chartered banks and unchartered “free banks” took hold during 
this period, issuing their own notes, redeemable in gold or specie. 
Banks also began offering demand deposits to enhance commerce. In 
response to a rising volume of check transactions, the New York 
Clearinghouse Association was established in 1853 to provide a way for 
the city’s banks to exchange checks and settle accounts.</p>
<p><big><strong>1863: National Banking Act</strong></big></p>
<p>During the Civil War, the National Banking Act of 1863 was passed, 
providing for nationally chartered banks, whose circulating notes had to
 be backed by U.S. government securities. An amendment to the act 
required taxation on state bank notes but not national bank notes, 
effectively creating a uniform currency for the nation. Despite taxation
 on their notes, state banks continued to flourish due to the growing 
popularity of demand deposits, which had taken hold during the Free 
Banking Era.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister William Pitt,&nbsp;whose nation’s debt doubled
 to £243 million during the American Revolutionary War, stated:</p>
<p>“Let the American people go into their debt-funding schemes and 
banking systems, and from that hour their boasted independence will be a
 mere phantom.”<br><strong><br>Jefferson</strong>&nbsp;described the Bank of the United States “as a machine for the corruption of the legislature.”<br><strong><br><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/02bd424b-96d8-4f34-950c-337baeb05030.jpg" width="213" height="164" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.20946" align="left" border="0" hspace="25" vspace="25"></strong></p>
<p>In 1811,&nbsp;<strong>James Madison&nbsp;</strong>refused to recharter the Bank of the United States.</p>
<p>As British financiers reportedly owned two-thirds of the Bank’s 
stock, this may have been a factor precipitating the War of 1812.&nbsp;<strong><br><img loading="lazy" class="cc-image-resize" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/king%20louis%20xvi.jpeg" width="249" height="164" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.22549" align="right" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"><br></strong><br>France incurred enormous debt helping America win independence from Britain.</p>
<p>This destabilized the country, leading to King Louis XVI being forced from the throne and then beheaded on January 21, 1793.</p>

<p>The French Republic was formed, but by 1799 it was bankrupt, setting the stage for Napoleon to take power.</p>
<p>R. McNair Wilson’s book,&nbsp;<em>Monarchy or Money Power</em>(1933), stated:</p>
<p>“It was ordained by Napoleon that money should not be exported from 
France on any pretext whatever except with the consent of the 
Government, and that in no circumstances should&nbsp;<strong>loans</strong>&nbsp;be employed to meet current expenditure whether civil or military.</p>
<p>The object was to withhold from finance the power to embarrass the Government as it had embarrassed the Government of&nbsp;<strong>Louis XVI.</strong><br><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/41tt0vppIpL.jpg" width="128" height="204" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.22550" align="right" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"></p>
<p>… When a Government, Bonaparte declared, is dependent for money upon 
bankers, they and not the leaders of that Government control the 
situation, since ‘the hand that gives is above the hand that takes’ …</p>
<p>‘Money,’ he declared, ‘has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency: their sole object is gain.'”</p>

<p>A legend persists that&nbsp;<strong>Nathan Rothschild&nbsp;</strong>obtained early information of the British victory over&nbsp;<strong>Napoleon</strong>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<strong>Battle of Waterloo,</strong>&nbsp;June 18, 1815.</p>
<p><strong>Rothschild</strong>&nbsp;began to sell his shares on the 
London Stock Exchange, leading investors to suspect he had inside 
information that the British&nbsp;<strong>lost</strong>&nbsp;the battle, resulting in panic-selling off of stocks.</p>
<p>The legend continued that he bought up devalued shares at low prices,
 and when news arrived the next day that the British had actually&nbsp;<strong>won</strong>the
 Battle of Waterloo, the stock market enthusiastically exploded, 
resulting in Rothschild making a million pounds sterling in a day.<br><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/Haus_der_Rotschilds_in_der_frankfurter_Judengasse.jpg" width="95" height="146" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.22546" align="left" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"></p>

<p>On JULY 10, 1832,&nbsp;<strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>&nbsp;vetoed the charter renewal of<strong>Nicholas Biddle’s Second Bank of the United States</strong>, stating:</p>
<p>“Some of powers and privileges possessed by the existing Bank are&nbsp;<strong>unauthorized by the Constitution</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>subversive to the rights of the States</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>dangerous to the liberties of the people</strong>&nbsp;…</p>

<p>… Their&nbsp;<strong>power</strong>&nbsp;would be great whenever they might choose to exert it … to&nbsp;<strong>influence elections</strong>&nbsp;or control the affairs of the nation.</p>
<p>But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to 
curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be 
doubted that he would be&nbsp;<strong>made to feel its influence</strong>&nbsp;…”</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson continued:</p>
<p>”&nbsp;<strong>Controlling our currency,</strong>receiving our public moneys, and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence,&nbsp;<strong>it would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy</strong>.”<br><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/The%20Economic%20Consequences%20of%20the%20Peace.jpeg" width="166" height="233" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.22547" align="right" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"></p>
<p><strong>Economist John Maynard Keynes</strong>&nbsp;held the same view, as he wrote in his book<i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i>&nbsp;(1920, reprinted 1971, p. 235):</p>
<p>“Lenin is said to have declared ‘The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency.'”</p>
<p>On September 18, 1833,&nbsp;<strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>&nbsp;decided to remove all Federal money out of&nbsp;<strong>Nicholas Biddle’s Second Bank of the United State</strong>s:</p>
<p>”&nbsp;<strong>The Bank is thus converted into a vast electioneering engine</strong>, with means to&nbsp;<strong>embroil the country in deadly feuds</strong>, and … extend its<strong>corruption</strong>&nbsp;through all the ramifications of society …</p>

<p><strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>, whose wife died right before he took office, stated in a Protest Message to the Senate, April 15, 1834:</p>
<p>“The Bank of the United States,&nbsp;<strong>a great moneyed monopoly</strong>, had attempted to obtain a renewal of its charter<strong>by controlling the elections of the people</strong>&nbsp;… to&nbsp;<strong>control public opinion</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>force the Government to yield to its demands</strong>&nbsp;…</p>
<p>The only ambition I can feel is to acquit myself to Him to whom I must soon render an account of my stewardship …</p>
<p>to persuade my countrymen, so far as I may, that it is not in a …<strong>government supported by powerful monopolies&nbsp;</strong>…
 that they will find happiness … but in a plain system, void of pomp, 
protecting all and granting favors to none, dispensing its blessings, 
like the dews of Heaven.”</p>
<p>On December 1, 1834, in his 6th Annual Message,&nbsp;<strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>stated:</p>

<p>“Events have satisfied my mind, and I think the minds of the American people, that the&nbsp;<strong>mischief and dangers which flow from a national Bank</strong>&nbsp;far overbalance all its advantages.</p>
<p>The bold effort the present Bank has made&nbsp;<strong>to control the Government</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>distresses it has wantonly produced</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>violence</strong>&nbsp;of which it has been the occasion in one of our cities famed for its observance of law and order,</p>

<p>On January 30, 1835, in the midst of the&nbsp;<strong>“Bank War,” President Andrew Jackson</strong>survived&nbsp;<strong>an assassination attempt</strong>&nbsp;when Richard Lawrence fired two pistols at him at point blank range.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the wet foggy weather in Washington, D.C., the guns misfired.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/d2273992-5d6c-49d1-ad57-c1ff1d81734d.png" alt="null" width="213" height="146" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.16914" align="left" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"></p>
<p><strong>Davy Crockett,</strong>&nbsp;who was with the President, ran up and wrestled the assailant, disarming him.</p>
<p><strong>Senator Thomas Hart Benton</strong>wrote January 30, 1835 of how the incident:</p>
<p>“… irresistibly carried many minds to the belief in&nbsp;<strong>a superintending Providence,</strong>&nbsp;manifested
 in the extraordinary case of two pistols in succession — so well 
loaded, so cooly handled, and which afterwards fired with such 
readiness, force,and precision — missing fire each in his turn, when 
leveled eight feet at the President’s heart.”</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<strong>King William IV of England</strong>&nbsp;heard of the incident, he wrote expressing his concern.&nbsp;<strong>President Jackson</strong>&nbsp;wrote back:</p>
<p>“A kind of Providence had been pleased to shield me against the 
recent attempt upon my life, and irresistibly carried many minds to the 
belief in a superintending Providence.”&nbsp;<strong><br><a class="imgCaptionAnchor" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119200203/https://americanminute.com/collections/printed-books/products/miracles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" shape="rect"><img loading="lazy" src="%E2%84%96%2012.%20The%20Wi%CE%A9ards%20of%20Fiat%20Currency_%20The%20Rothschilds%20and%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20System%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/37f83a1b-5022-483f-8c09-29afe05b12b1.jpg" width="200" height="139" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.6977" align="left" border="0" hspace="30" vspace="30"></a></strong></p>

<p>On December 7, 1835, in his 7th Annual Message,&nbsp;<strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>&nbsp;stated:</p>
<p>“We have felt but one class of these&nbsp;<strong>dangers</strong>&nbsp;exhibited in the contest waged by the Bank of the United States …</p>
<p>The Bank is, in fact, but one of the fruits of a&nbsp;<strong>system at war with the genius of all our institutions</strong>&nbsp;… whose great&nbsp;<strong>ultimate object</strong>&nbsp;and inevitable result … is the&nbsp;<strong>consolidation of all power in our system in one central government.</strong></p>
<p>Lavish&nbsp;<strong>public disbursements</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>corporations with exclusive privileges</strong>&nbsp;would be its&nbsp;<strong>substitutes for the original … checks and balances</strong>&nbsp;of the Constitution …</p>
<p>Wherever this spirit has effected&nbsp;<strong>an alliance with political power, tyranny and despotism</strong>&nbsp;have been the fruit … It has to be incessantly watched, or it corrupts …</p>
<p>All history tells us that&nbsp;<strong>a free people should be watchful of delegated power</strong>, and should never acquiesce in a practice which will diminish their control over it.”</p>

<p>On December 5, 1836, in his 8th Annual Message,<strong>President Andrew Jackson</strong>stated:</p>
<p>“It was in view of these evils, together with the<strong>dangerous power</strong>&nbsp;wielded by the Bank of the United States and its&nbsp;<strong>repugnance to our Constitution</strong>,
 that I was induced to exert the power conferred upon me by the American
 people to prevent the continuance of that institution …</p>
<p>The lessons taught by the Bank of the United States cannot well be lost upon the American people. They will take care&nbsp;<strong>never again to place so tremendous a power in irresponsible hands</strong>.”</p>

<p>“The distress and alarm which pervaded and&nbsp;<strong>agitated the whole country</strong>&nbsp;when the Bank of the United States&nbsp;<strong>waged war</strong>&nbsp;upon the people in order&nbsp;<strong>to compel them to submit to its demands</strong>&nbsp;cannot yet be forgotten …</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Government</strong>&nbsp;would have&nbsp;<strong>passed from the hands of the many to the hands of the few</strong>, and this&nbsp;<strong>organized money power</strong>&nbsp;from its&nbsp;<strong>secret conclave</strong>&nbsp;would have&nbsp;<strong>dictated the choice of your highest officers</strong>&nbsp;and compelled you to make peace or war, as best suited their own wishes.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES ABOUT THE MEN INVOLVED</strong></p>
<p>Six men figured prominently in establishing this new entity, commonly
 referred to as the second Bank of the United States: the financiers <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>John Jacob Astor</strong></span>,
 David Parish, Stephen Girard, and Jacob Barker; Alexander Dallas, who 
would become secretary of the Treasury in 1814; and Rep. John C. Calhoun
 of South Carolina. These men thought that reestablishing a national 
bank would solve some of the country’s economic woes. In particular, 
Astor, Parish, Girard, and Barker – as lenders and financiers — felt 
that a national bank would restore a stable currency, thereby avoiding 
bouts of inflation and insuring their business interests. —Federal
