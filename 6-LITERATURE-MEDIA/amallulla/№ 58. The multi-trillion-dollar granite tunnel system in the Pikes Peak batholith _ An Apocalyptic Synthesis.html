 This page was never finished. There are incomplete section and stuff I 
have not looked at in ages. I wish I could devote more time to this 
page. If you want to understand CIA involvement in drugs and why cocaine
 use became almost epidemic in the United States in the 1980s, the 
answer is here on this page. Someone had to pay for this multi-trillion 
dollar tunnel system. The most important section to read is <em>The geographical uniqueness of the Pikes Peak granite batholith</em>. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is a must read for anyone who studies my work.</strong></span></em>
 The Pikes Peak batholith has always been “the prize” sought after by 
both the Ћinkers and the bankers. Or, it may be a piezoelectric trap set
 by the Ћinkers or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/nine/">Nine</a>. Only time will tell.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: September 22, 2021</p>

<h2><span id="The_Colorado_School_of_Mines">The Colorado School of Mines</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">It’s odd, but Wikipedia has the only copy
 of this Colorado School of Mines seal on the entire Internet, and it is
 an inferior copy measuring a measly 192 x 188 pixels. But what I find 
infinitely more interesting is that the State of Colorado seal, the seal

<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">Nothing without providence</div>
<p>This is the Colorado state motto. But why? We know beyond any shadow 
of a doubt that the progeny of Jove are not religious. In fact, they 
despise religion. This is why I always feel obligated to explain to the 
reader when this word <em>providence</em> is used, that it has two distinct meanings. I’ll ignore the one that references God.</p>

<p>So, it would not be a stretch to read this motto as “Nothing without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/cheesman/">Cheesman dam</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/den/">Denver International Airport</a>,
 and a multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system” (the Vault 
Profound). This is exactly the meaning intended and explains why all 
three of these seals are the same.</p>

<h2><span id="Etymology_of_the_vault_profound">Etymology of the vault profound</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">On the <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em> website, I refer to this multi-trillion dollar tunnel system as the <em>vault profound</em>.
 Forty miles west of Denver, Colorado in the Front Range deep inside a 
1.08 billion-year-old granite batholith there exists an extensive tunnel
 system that has been under construction for more than 60 years now (at 
the very least), ever since the first <em>tunnel boring machine</em> (TBM) was invented. In the following line from his <em>Eclogue IV</em>, the Latin poet Publius Vergilius Maro (commonly know as <em>Virgil</em>) refers to this extensive underground tunnel system that he knew would be built in the distant future as the “Vault Profound.”</p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p><span style="font-size: 66px; line-height: 80px;"><em>See how it totters- the world’s orbed might, Earth, and wide ocean, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">the vault profound</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For longer than your mind will ever allow you to fully believe, a people I call the <em>progeny of Jove</em>
 have planned to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement inside of
 this granite batholith. They have no loyalty to any country. The United
 States of America was merely a means to that end. From their point of 
view, the entire Fifth World is transitory, an illusion of their own 
creating (the Matrix) and one that will very soon be utterly destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unfinished pyramid upon [the one-dollar bill’s] reverse side is a trestleboard setting forth symbolically the task to <span style="color: #ff0000;">the accomplishment of which the United States Government was dedicated from the day of its inception.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated observation, the official designation (or <em>airport code</em>) for the Denver International Airport is not DIA. It’s <strong>DEN</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the very same den to which the progeny of Jove referred when 
they wrote the Book of Revelation over two thousand years ago.</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Revelation 6:15</strong><br>And the kings of the earth, and 
the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty 
men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens 
and in the rocks of the mountains;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">Everything is <span style="color: #ff0000;">one thing</span>.</div>
<p>And that one thing is the coming Earth crustal displacement. The 
money spent and the amount of planning that has gone into this extensive
 underground tunnel system boggles the mind. The 4.8 billion dollar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/dia/">Denver International Airport (DIA)</a>
 is merely the reception center for this “den,” which is not in the soft
 ground underneath the airport but in the 1.08 billion-year-old granite 
Pikes Peak batholith in the Front Range, a symbolic 40 miles west of 
Denver, Colorado.</p>
<div class="impact-54">Virgil’s “vault profound,” the DEN (both in 
Colorado and in the Bible), and the “unfinished pyramid” to which Manly 
P. Hall refers in the above quote are all <span style="color: #ff0000;">one and the same thing</span><em>.</em></div>
<p>In these high-tech caves, the progeny of Jove hope to accomplish what
 no previous highly developed society on earth has ever done before 
(including whoever built the Great Pyramid of Giza), which is to survive
 what the ancient Greeks called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7489p15r&amp;chunk.id=d0e7855&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>kataklysmos</em></a> (κατακλυσμός, “inundation”) with enough food, water (from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/dia/#the-lesson-of-the-cheesman-dam">Cheesman dam</a>),
 and other supplies as well as all of the our knowledge (the patent 
databases and Wikipedias of the world), enough highly advanced military 
equipment to outfit a small army, and technology that we do not know 
even exists (such as the “directed energy weapon” used to destroy the 
Twin Towers and Building 7 on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/dust/">9/11</a>, “free” energy machines, and anti-gravity propulsion systems from downed spacecraft they are trying to reverse engineer).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">Their
 vision of the future has been captured in Walt Disney’s “Tomorrowland” 
movie. You cannot understand them without watching this movie.</p>

</div></figure><p>I think the five story building they buried during 
construction,—which by the way is well-documented,—will be used in part 
as a holding cell for people caught in the transition from DIA being a 
normal airport and when they lock the gates and start receiving what I 
like to think of as the “144,000” from all over the world. And doubtless
 some of the people on those planes will not be cleared for entry into 
the tunnel system. They too will have to be held until after everyone 
has arrived and the operation of DIA is shut down. Allowing such people 
back on the streets of Denver, Colorado to let others know what they

<p>However, beyond this, thinking the tunnel system is under DIA in what
 the mining industry refers to as overburdern when there is a huge 
surface-level granite batholith 30 miles away in the Front Range is, 
well, stupid to be honest. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But the Denver International Airport is hiding something.</em></strong></span> And what it is hiding are spurs off of the Automated Guideway Transit System (AGTS) that lead to the Front Range, <em>most
 likely via Golden Colorado, home of the Colorado School of mines and 
the men and women who for generations now have been building Virgil’s 
“vault profound.”</em> There are precisely 30 miles as the crow flies from DIA to the predominantly German miner’s town of Golden, Colorado <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>at the edge of the Front Range</em></strong></span>. Golden, Colorado is of immense historical importance to the progeny of Jove. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I believe this is where you will find the underground entrance to the vault profound.</em></strong></span> I am certain of this.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><br></em></strong></span></p>
<p>The first time I ever rode on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_International_Airport_Automated_Guideway_Transit_System" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Denver International Airport Automated Guideway Transit System</em></a>
 I gasped as we rode past a junction to the left and the other tunnel 
headed down a steep grade and eloquently curved back towards the 
straight track on which I was traveling. The curve in thes spur looked 
to me as if it were designed to excite, like a roller coaster ride. No 
one puts that much thought into a maintenance line. And why would they 
go to the expense of digging deeper for what a maintenance level? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 economics of creating a deeper level of track for maintenance of the 
railroad cars makes no sense whatsoever when you have 54 acres of 
property.</em></strong></span> I shall never forget that moment. My 
heart leaped out of my chest because I knew this would be the closest I 
ever got to seeing what Virgil and I call the <em>vault profound</em>. It reminded me of a scene from <em>Tomorrowland</em>.</p>

 Nothing else like it exists in the entire world. Its very existence 
baffles geologist to this very day. All throughout history the “greats” 
have known that surviving the coming Earth crustal displacement in this 
extensive underground tunnel system was the destiny of the progeny of 
Jove, their progeny. Indeed, knowledge of the coming Earth crustal 
displacement and that their progeny would survive is what made them 
“great” because <em>knowledge is power</em>.</p>
<div class="impact-72">You cannot understand anything I am saying on 
this website unless you grasp the geographical uniqueness of the Pikes 
Peak granite. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There is no other granite batholith at such a high altitude and so far from an ocean anywhere else in the world.</span> It is the ideal location for surviving an Earth crustal displacement.</div>
<p>The “Vault Profound” is a tunnel system drilled into the Pikes Peak 
Batholith in Colorado. The progeny of Jove is what most people who 
dabble in secret societies would think of as “in control” of the world 
right now. They control of the extensive tunnel systems in Colorado and 
throughout the Western United States. As shown in the following 
Wikipedia excerpts, they’ve drilled down into solid granite that is more
 than a billion years old, <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>as far from an ocean shore as possible (anywhere in the world)</strong></span></em>,
 protected by from Pacific Ocean super tsunamis by a symbolic 54 peaks 
over 14,000 feet tall, and next to some of the most stable land in all 
of the world. Here it is worth noting that the official code for the 
Denver International Airport is not DIA. It is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DEN</strong></span>. Get it? The DEN and the Vault Profound are the same thing.</p>
<p>The growth of the Rocky Mountains in the United States is a 
geological puzzle. Mountain building is normally focused between 200 to 
400 miles (300 to 600 km) inland from a subduction zone boundary. 
Geologists continue to gather evidence to explain the rise of the 
Rockies so much farther inland.</p>
<p>It is <del>cave</del> den unlike any other in the history of mankind. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 combination is so unique that I have come to regard this location as 
having been on the drawing boards for thousands of years.</em> </strong></span>Seriously.
 On this website, I only go as far as saying the Knights Templar fleet 
sailed to the Americas after leaving France, for which their is proof 
discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/">№ 55. The Stone of Destiny and New Atlantis</a>.
 But at one time I had an entire page discussing the possibility that 
the Roman elite sailed to South America two thousand years ago, and that
 Peru became their world headquarters.</p>

 The Pikes Peak granite is a 1.08 billion year old widespread geologic 
formation found in the central part of the Front Range of Colorado. <strong>Erosion</strong>
 Today, the Pikes Peak Batholith and Granite is exposed over a large 
part of the central Front Range of Colorado. It is found as far north as
 the southern slopes of Mount Evans west of Denver, west to South Park, 
and as far south as Cañon City. The batholith is about 80 miles (130 km)
 long in the north-south direction and about 25 miles (40 km) wide east 
to west. Even more of it remains hidden underground. Geologists have 
found the granite at the bottom of deep wells on the plains and magnetic
 sensors have detected it as much as 80 miles (130 km) to the east. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Colorado Plateau</strong></a> <strong>Geology </strong>One

<p>At moments like this, I sense I lose many a reader. But what choice 
do I have except to state the truth plainly? This is why I dedicated the
 first seven pages of this website to help awaken readers to the 
entirely fabricated reality in which we live. I wish there was something
 I could do to make it easier for you to accept this apparently 
fantastical reality. But alas, the decision to take the red pill is 
yours, not mine. What I can do is to explain to you why the Pikes Peak 
granite in the Front Range was chosen as the progeny of Jove’s last 
stand, which is the <em>raison d’être</em> for this page. This is what 
led to North America being preserved in a pristine state until these end
 times and the slaughter of the Native Americans so that the work on the
 tunnel systems could begin. The purpose of the United States of America
 is simply to facilitate those ends. This is your reality. You can 
either accept or reject it.</p>
<p>On this website, I refer to that tunnel system as the “vault 
profound.” The Roman poet Virgil wrote about it over 2,000 years ago. 
The prototypes of the modern monstrosities known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tunnel boring machines</a>
 that made these granite tunnels possible were invented less than 100 
years ago, but I believe the progeny of Jove chose the Front Range 
location at least 2,600 years ago. Rediscovering its location was top 
priority of the U.S. Department of the Interior after it was created on 
March 3, 1849.At the time it was designed, the U.S. Department of the 
Interior was being used to survey the Western United States to find the 
“white mountain,” what they would later dub “Pikes Peak” as a nod to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pike" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Albert Pike</a>.
 w the critical role the U.S. Department of the Interior and its 
predecessor organizations played in finding the future location of what 
the Latin poet Virgil and I call the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/den/">vault profound</a>” in the Front Range near to Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>The buffalo represents death. Their senseless slaughter is a perfect 
analogy for what is about to happen to the unsuspecting masses.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the great herds were nearly gone before any organized 
attempts were made to survey populations, we may never know just how 
many buffalo once roamed North America, although <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>estimates range from 30 to 75 million</strong></span>.
 “The moving multitude…darkened the whole plains,” wrote Lewis and 
Clark, who encountered a herd at South Dakota’s White River in 1806.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>By 1800, the small buffalo herds east of the Mississippi River were 
gone. Buffalo may have been killed to protect livestock and farmlands in
 that region. With westward expansion of the American frontier, 
systematic reduction of the plains herds began around 1830, when buffalo
 hunting became the chief industry of the plains. Organized groups of 
hunters killed buffalo for hides and meat, often killing up to 250 
buffalo a day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people at the time also wanted to eradicate 
buffalo as a way to take away the livelihood and well- being of Native 
Americans. Native American tribes depended on the buffalo’s meat and 
hides, and many still today believe the animal has special spiritual and
 healing powers, making it an important part of their culture.</p>
<p>The construction of the railroads across the plains further hastened 
the depletion of buffalo populations. Hunting from train windows was 
advertised widely and passengers shot them as the buffalo raced beside 
the trains. By 1883 both the northern and the southern herds had been 
destroyed. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Less than 300 wild animals</strong></span> remained in the U.S. and Canada by the turn of the century out of the millions that once lived there.</p>

 us assume a similar fate awaits mankind. Using even the most 
conservative estimate for the number of buffalo that once roamed North 
America, 30,000,000 to 300 is 0.00001% of the original population. In 
human terms, given a world population of 7,681,200,000 (rounded to the 
nearest one hundred thousand as of this writing) from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://www.census.gov/popclock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">World Population Clock</a>
 on the Census.gov website, that would be the equivalent of 
7,681,200,000 x 0.00001 = 76,812 survivors. Get the picture? It is 
difficult to imagine that the stench of over seven billion corpses will 
not fill the air no matter where you are afterward.</p>

 I seldom cuss on this website, and I promise what follows is my one 
single use of the F word. For those with more delicate sensibilities, <em>please forgive my use of the vernacular</em>. But I am compelled by the very designers of this seal to express its message bluntly and in the language of the people.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I like to have died laughing the first time I saw it.</em></strong></span>
 I could not believe these guys got so careless. The date is in your 
face. The nine sun rays pretty much summarizes how they feel about 
themselves. What were they thinking? Did they really think no one would 
ever see this image for what it is? There are nine sun rays because <em>these people just love their numbers</em>. “Worship” would be a better word. And, yes, March 3 is 33.</p>
<p>Why are the horns white? This for me is one of the more intriguing 
aspects of the design. Did you know the word “horns” (plural) appears in
 only one book in the New Testament? There are nine uses of “horns” in 
The Revelation. Likewise, there are only nine references to “ten horns” 
in the Bible. Three are in The Book of Daniel and six are in The 
Revelation. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The progeny of Jove wrote both of these books.</em></strong></span> I would argue very strongly that this is a self-identifying element of the design. The name of the constellation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricornus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Capricornus</a>
 is Latin for “horned goat.” For the people who really control this 
world, it is symbolic of a time after the Earth crustal displacement 
(after the Age of Aquarius) in which they imagine themselves in control 
of the entire world with a vastly reduced population.</p>
<p>All of this is not my imagination. It is the truth. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 seal for the U.S. Department of the Interior gives you an important 
glimpse into the mindset of the progeny of Jove in their heyday as the 
Freemasons.</em></strong></span> At the time it was designed, the U.S. 
Department of the Interior was being used to survey the Western United 
States to find the “white mountain,” what they would later dub “Pikes 
Peak” as a nod to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pike" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Albert Pike</a>.</p>

 I can think of no more appropriate quote with which to introduce this 
subject than the following from a Manly P. Hall lecture entitled “Secret
 Language of Symbolism.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;"><strong>…
one thing is sure, the emblem is not going to be easily unlocked, is 
going to fight to hold its secret, just as much as you may fight to take
 that secret from it. As Pike said in his little article I read to you, 
each of these symbols is a kind of Sphinx, and each one who comes into 
the presence of it and tries to tries to solve its riddle is also a kind
 of edifice and this edifice must either solve the riddle or perish by 
the cruelty or strange device which he has been unable to fathom.</strong></p>

<p>Here is an explanation of the “G” in Freemasonry from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/letter-g.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Masonic Lodge of Education</a>, “Your Guide to Understanding Freemasonry.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Masonic letter G reminds us that our every act is done in the sight of the Great Architect of the Universe. “By <u>letters four</u> and <u>science five</u>, this “<b>G</b>”
 aright doth stand, in due Art and Proportion; you have your answer, 
friend.” What are the “letters four”? It is believed that they stand for
 <b>“YHWH”, the name of the Great Architect of the Universe</b> 
(pronounced “Yahway”. (sometimes pronounced Jehovah) in the ancient 
Hebrew language, from which the Bible was translated: Which is the 5th 
science? <b>Geometry</b>. The Letter G stands for “Geometry”, which is 
the mathematical science upon which Architecture and Masonry were 
founded. When did the letter G become part of the Square and Compass? No
 one knows exactly, but it is believed to be somewhere between 1730 and 
1768, here in the United States. The “G” is not used in the center of 
the square and compasses in all jurisdictions around the world.</p>

<p>In many English speaking countries, the Square and Compasses are 
depicted with the letter “G” in the center. The letter has multiple 
meanings, representing different words depending on the context in which
 it is discussed. The most common is that the “G” stands for Geometry, 
and is to remind Masons that Geometry and Freemasonry are synonymous 
terms described as being the “noblest of sciences”, and “the basis upon 
which the superstructure of Freemasonry, and everything in existence in 
the entire universe is erected. In this context it can also stand for 
Great Architect of the Universe (a non-denominational reference to 
God).” —Wikipedia, Square and Compasses, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_and_Compasses#With_a_%22G%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">With a “G”</a></p>

 this is utter nonsense. If Freemason symbols are comparable to the 
layers of an onion, you can be assured this is only the skin or outer 
layer. Now admittedly, the Freemason rank and file may believe the 
“Great Architect” and “Geometry” nonsense, but it is nonetheless a 
progeny of Jove subterfuge. What is of interest here is that the “G” was
 introduced in the United States of America shortly before the 
Declaration of Independence. Why are the Freemasons making this change 
to their trademark symbol? What does it mean? And why is it apparently 
only relevant to the Freemasons in the United States of America? The 
answer to this question is simple. In fact, simplicity is the key to 
unlocking the meaning of symbols used by secret societies such as the 
Freemasons and Skull and Bone. <em>All the talk about God, the Great Architect, and Geometry is so much mindless prattle</em>. The meaning of the Freemason square and compass is not deep. It is staring you in the face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">The
 progeny of Jove relay on the sophistry and pretentious nature of 
“educated” men to belie and obfuscate the simplicity of their symbols.</p>
<p>In that sense, manly P. Hall did us all a great disservice. The “G” 
stands for granite and is a reference to the Pikes Peak granite 
batholith in the Front Range, what Virgil called the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/vault/">vault profound</a>” where the progeny of Jove think they will survive the coming destruction of the planet. <big>Seen from the (upside down) perspective of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/progeny/">progeny of Jove</a> (think Freemasons, Illuminati, Skull and Bones, etc.), the <em>square</em> is a huge granite slab like those in the Great Pyramid of Giza.</big></p>

<p>The “G” is for granite. This is a granite tunnel protecting the progeny of Jove from the consequence of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/sirius/">our binary dance with Sirius</a>,
 the “blazing star” behind the capital letter G. Are you starting to see
 what I do? I assure you, the adoption of this rather non-esoteric 
symbolism is in keeping with the character of the progeny of Jove. They 
have a sense of humor, only the joke is always on you and the joke is 
that “G” stands for “God,” the “Great Architect,” or “Geometry.” As I 
said above, the progeny of Jove relay on the sophistry and pretentious 
nature of “educated” men to belie and obfuscate the simplicity of their 
symbols. You must believe this because we know beyond any shadow of a 
doubt that the Founding Fathers believed in the astrotheology 
explanation of religion.</p>

 the “Guidestones,” the Georgia Guidestones Guidebook (GGG). Everything 
is G. And then there is the “Guidestones Group” mentioned on the black 
granite plaque. Why so many Gs?</p>
<p>Why? Why indeed. This is what makes the Freemasons in the South, the 
great-great-grandchildren of the last true Freemasons who fought in the 
“Civil War” when the United States of America was defeated by the 
European Illuminati (posing as the Supreme Council, Scottish Rite, 
Northern Jurisdiction) and ceased to exist as a legal entity. They are 
trying to tell you something, but you must be willing to listen.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Granite is one of the hardest substances 
on the planet. I wish everyone reading this were familiar with the work 
of D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair in “Cataclysm!: Compelling Evidence of a
 Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C.” There exist no better description of 
what happened in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/9500bce/">9500 BC</a>
 when Venus was expelled (born) from Jupiter and the last Golden Age 
ended. Entire continents rose and fell relative to the ocean level at 
the time. Basically, the earth’s crust became plastic. As bad as 9500 BC
 was, according to men of great renown and whose words have survived for
 millennia, what is about to happen may be an order of magnitude worse. 
At the very least it is going to be a repeat of 9500 BC, which all but 
destroyed the entire surface of the planet. Indeed, in Mathew 24, Christ
 Jesus also says “except those days should be shortened, there should no
 flesh be saved.” Joel: <span style="font-style: italic;">“…let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for <strong>the day of the Lord cometh</strong>,
 for it is nigh at hand; a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of 
clouds and of thick darkness…there hath not been ever the like, neither 
shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations”</span> Jeremiah: <span style="font-style: italic;">“Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it”</span> Daniel: <span style="font-style: italic;">“there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation”</span> Christ Jesus: <span style="font-style: italic;">“then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be”</span></p>
<p>How does one survive something like this? What do the progeny of Jove

 of this sealed test tube as the granite tunnels in which the progeny of
 Jove expect to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please
 allow me to paint an important mental picture for you, one that will 
explain for you how the progeny of Jove think about their “vault 
profound.”</span> Imagine yourself in a sealed test tube. The test tube 
represents one of the many tunnels created by tunnel boring machines 
(TBM) that have been busy tunneling underground in the Western United 
States since before I was born, over 60 years ago. Now you must think of
 Earth’s crust as fluid, which indeed much of it shall become because of
 something called liquefaction. So how do you survive?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soil liquefaction occurs when a saturated or partially saturated soil
 substantially loses strength and stiffness in response to an applied 
stress such as shaking during an earthquake or other sudden change in 
stress condition, in which material that is ordinarily a solid behaves 
like a liquid. –Wikipedia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Soil liquefaction</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">If you are about to rock ‘n’ roll like some ice cube in a Martini mix (bumper cars is another good analogy), <em>the only way to assure that you will not be crushed to death is to entomb yourself in the hardest substance on earth</em>.<strong> From a practical standpoint, that is granite</strong>.
 There are harder substances to be sure (e.g. diamond), but not in huge 
blocks large enough for tunnel boring machines (TBM). For that, there is
 nothing harder than granite. So now we must imagine the test tube as 
made of granite pounding against other rocks and materials in Earth’s 
crust on what the Bible calls the “day of the Lord” when much of the 
Earth surface will in fact become almost soup-like. As scary as that may
 sound, if your container is stronger than anything else in Earth’s 
crust, then you have good reason to believe you will survive intact. 
This analogy is less than perfect because these batholiths are huge. 
Batholiths are defined as “<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>greater than 40 square miles and no known floor</em></strong></span>” in the following definition from the Colorado Geographical Society website.</span></p>

<p>The green batholith in this last image in what is known as the <em>Pikes Peak granite</em>
 batholith. Even in this two-dimensional drawing, it is huge. But you 
must remember that it by definition has “no known floor.” No one knows 
how deep the progeny of Jove have drilled into the Pikes Peak granite 
batholith, but you can be sure that they are more than a couple of miles
 deep. It is at that depth that the test tube analogy breaks down 
because the walls of their tunnels as that depth are measured in miles 
of solid granite.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: large;">I<strong>f
 you are inside granite deep in the crust on the “day of the Lord,” 
there is nothing outside strong enough to crush your container. The only
 question then is Where? Granite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batholith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">batholiths</a>
 exist all over the planet, but they are close to ocean shorelines where
 the orogenic process of mountain building naturally occurs. And that’s a
 serious problem because you might find yourself underwater in the 
aftermath of the Apocalypse. Ideally, you need to be further inland and 
at elevation.</strong></p>
<p>I submit to you that the progeny of Jove followed this exact same line of reasoning <em>at least 2,600 years ago</em>
 when they scouted the Western Hemisphere in search of the best place to
 survive the coming Earth crustal displacement. They found what they 
were looking for in what would later become known as the Pikes Peak 
granite batholith, the uniqueness of which throughout the entire world 
cannot be overstated.</p>

<hr><p>The thought behind surviving in granite tunnels is rather simple.
 When the planet starts to rock and roll during the reconfiguration and 
subsequent Earth crustal displacement, including all the megatsunamis, 
mega earthquakes, and volcanoes, where else would you want to be other 
than inside of a vessel made of one of the hardest substances on the 
planet? You may <em>shake, rattle and roll</em> but nothing is strong 
enough to break your vessel. The self-evident truth of this statement is
 the sheer age of the granite batholiths in Colorado. They are over a 
billion years old. How can you go wrong inside of a structure that has 
survived a billion years intact? The problem here is one of precedence. 
The progeny of Jove think they have upgraded from the soft volcanic ash 
rock (tuff) of the underground cities used by the Phrygians in Anatolia 
or the underground cities used by the Egyptians that were carved into 
the limestone underneath the Giza plateau. The progeny of Jove know 
their own heritage. Their progenitors survived the catastrophes of their
 day in these underground cities. Theirs is made of granite. Granite is 
harder than tuff and limestone. How can they go wrong? If you are not 
familiar with piezoelectricity, please watch this short introductory

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Granite is piezoelectric</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;">It’s always what you don’t see coming that hurts the most. In this case, no one can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">piezoelectricity</a>. However, the ancients were well aware of this property of granite. It’s deadly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;">And “The Nine” know it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;">The “Unnamed Entity” does not.</p>
<p>There are two pressures that will be applied to the granite batholith in Colorado. The first is the <em>hydrostatic pressure</em>
 of the Pacific Ocean as it rolls across the Rocky Mountains following 
an Earth crustal displacement. This immense pressure is also going to 
result in a Yellowstone supervolcano eruption of some magnitude. How big
 is another question, but that there is some level of eruption because 
those huge magma chambers are going to be hit like a punching bag.</p>
<p>I believe this surge in amperage will instantly kill every living 
thing in those tunnels but preserve the technology. No amount of 
shielding could save them from the amperes that will be generated by 
such a huge block of granite under the weight of an incalculable amount 
of seawater. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They’re dead. 
They just don’t know it yet. If there is any justice to all of this, no 
one will ever notice. Their corpses will be lost to history. Their names
 completely forgotten.</em> </strong></span></p>
<p>How old is this deathtrap? I have thought about this for a long time.
 For me there is only one answer. The granite batholith in Colorado was 
well known to the civilization that thrived before 9500 BC when 
Proto-Saturn exploded. The very same people who have carried forward 
precise knowledge of this cycle of destruction we call the Ekpyrosis 
knew to dig into soft stone for their survival in both Egypt and 
Anatolia. I think this knowledge dates back to a time when the gods 
reigned in what David Talbott calls the Polar Configuration. What makes 
this a deathtrap or “rat trap” is that the Egyptians did know about 
piezoelectricity. They used it to generate electricity. Please watch the
 following vide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://youtu.be/tqXVPTQ0OF4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">This HUGE 5000 Year Old Secret Has Finally Been Solved</a> from the <span id="channel-title" class="style-scope ytd-c4-tabbed-header-renderer"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyYocf7ysbu2Fa2PWs3kE0A" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Matrix Wisdom</a> YouTube channel:</span>
 Somewhere along the line this knowledge was suppressed and not allowed 
to resurface again until the end of the last century. Too late. The 
Freemasons had already claimed Colorado as their own. They rediscovered 
this billion-year-old batholith following instructions that were 
preserved for thousands of years. Nothing was going to stop this plan 
from unfolding. In short, they have dug their own graves. It has to be 
this way. See also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/revelation/#the-8220lake-of-fire-burning-with-brimstone8221">The “lake of fire burning with brimstone”</a>.</p>

 There are ten names on this plaque, not eleven. At the time of this 
incident, the headquarters for the progeny of Jove was New York City, 
where they were working on what would become the Federal Reserve. My 
guess is that the eleventh person was a visiting dignitary or high 
ranking Freemason from New York City, someone of immense importance to 
the progeny of Jove. And that is why his name is lost to history. It 
would have been completely out of place on a plaque such as this.</p>

 drowned in the White Ash Mine disaster, one of the most serious 
accidents in Golden’s history. In commemoration of the lives lost in the
 tragedy, the unveiling of the new memorial site located on the Colorado
 School of Mines campus across from Marv Kay Stadium took place on 
October 29, 2016. The dedication ceremony was led by Marv Kay, a Mines 
alumnus and former football coach and athletic director. Stan Dempsey, a
 geologist, historian, lawyer, author and a recent inductee into the 
National Mining Hall of Fame, provided the historical account of the 
tragedy. “The White Ash Mine contained a bed of coal that had been 
upturned along the hogback,” Dempsey explained, recounting the geologic 
background of the area. Development began in 1877 and “by 1888 the shaft
 had been sunk down to a depth of 730 feet, which made it <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the deepest coal mine in the state</strong></span>,”
 said Dempsey. The Loveland Mine, the northern neighbor of the White Ash
 Mine, was abandoned in 1881 due to a coal fire, and “its ten and a half
 miles of workings was left to fill with water from the workings 
underneath Clear Creek,” said Dempsey. Additionally, the coal fire in 
the Loveland Mine had burned downward, damaging the 90-foot pillar 
separating the two mines until on September 9, 1889, the pillar broke 
and water burst through to the 280-foot level, flowing down to the 
440-foot level and eventually down the shaft to the very lowest level of
 the White Ash Mine, drowning the ten miners working in the lower 
depths. Foreman Evan Jones, superintendent of the White Ash Mine on the 
day of the accident, made several attempts to evacuate the mine. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The last attempt was made the next day at 7:30 a.m.</span></strong>
 as “Jones and the state mine inspector went down in a heavy iron bucket
 to conduct an inspection,” said Dempsey. After the inspection, it was 
decided that for the safety of the rescue team, no further rescues could
 be attempted. A memorial for those killed in the White Ash Mine 
disaster was first proposed in 1909. However, it wasn’t until 1936 that 
there was “a community effort led by the Junior Chamber of Commerce to 
create a small memorial with a plaque on a stone that stood on the end 
of 12<sup>th</sup> Street,” said Kay. The memorial was dedicated on September 9, 1936, by Mayor Albert Edward Jones, son of Evan Jones.</p>

 years later in 2009, John Ackle and his mother, Dorothy Ackle, decided 
to create a new memorial for the miners by starting the White Ash Mine 
Memorial Committee. They solicited proposals from 62 artists to create a
 bronze sculpture of a coal miner to stand alongside the plaque. The 
committee selected a design by well-known sculptor Cloyd Barnes. “The 
earliest and largest donors to the bronze were the Odd Fellows,” said 
Kay. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Many of the miners were members of the Odd Fellows</strong></span>,
 a fraternal order that participates in community and charity services. 
The Odd Fellows, alongside the Golden Civic Foundation and many Golden 
citizens aided in raising $60,000 to complete the statue. The bronze 
miner was completed in 2011 and kept in the Mines Geology Museum until 
its unveiling at the dedication ceremony on October 29. “The Colorado 
School of Mines provided the land, design and funding for this beautiful
 final resting place for the miners,” said Kay. “As part of the Clear 
Creek Athletic project, [Mines] felt the need and desire to see if a 
permanent memorial could be established.” As a result, the Golden Civic 
Foundation agreed to relinquish control of the piece so that Mines could
 provide a permanent site for the “internal remembrance of the tragic 
disaster and a final resting place for those <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>ten</strong></span> White Ash miners,” said Kay. “We’re sitting here today just imagining what 12<sup>th</sup>
 Street was like those couple of days with the wagons, other miners and 
grieving widows,” said Kay. “History talks about how the city was full 
of all the people that were willing to help.”</p>

<p>There were countless mining accidents in the Old West. Many thousands of lives were lost over the years. <em>Now I ask you, Why is this particular mining accident remembered to this very day?</em>
 Why? Now I want you to focus your attention on the depth of the mine. 
Think hard on what I am about to say. The above article says “<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the deepest coal mine in the state</strong></span>.”
 That is no small claim to fame in the state of Colorado at that time in
 history. What were they doing down so deep? But here is what fascinates
 me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">“73
 years later in 2009, John Ackle and his mother, Dorothy Ackle, decided 
to create a new memorial for the miners by starting the White Ash Mine 
Memorial Committee.”</p>
<p>Why 73 years later? Because that was the depth at which the miners 
were instantly crushed to depth and drowned. You see, the depth at which
 they were mining is also being commemorated, their goal, the real 
purpose of the White Ash Mine (self-financed through the sale of the 
coal), which was to reach the granite batholith, a decade long effort 
the ended in tragedy, and for the progeny of Jove a singular setback at a
 time when they ruled the United States of American with an iron fist.

 On September 9, 1889, a secret meeting was held in the private 
apartment at the top of the Eiffel Tower, during the 1889 Universal 
Exposition of Paris. Gathered at this meeting were four of the greatest 
minds of the time: Gustave Eiffel, Thomas Edison, Jules Verne, and 
Nikola Tesla. Eiffel, the host of the meeting, posed three questions to 
the men: What is the best possible future for all mankind? How do we 
make it? How do we make people want it? –Tomorrowland Wiki, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://tomorrowland.fandom.com/wiki/Plus_Ultra" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Plus Ultra</em></a></p>

 I could discuss this subject at length, delve into all the details. But
 what is the point? This is beyond the imaginative capacity of most 
readers and the only thing that matters to me is that I now know where 
to look for at least one of the entrances to the Vault Profound, 
somewhere in the vicinity of Golden, Colorado, which makes sense because
 the Denver International Airport, the Welcoming Center for the 144,000,
 is pretty close to due east from there (i.e. a straight shot). But of 
course, there is more than one entrance, including the underground 
tunnel connection from the Denver International Airport and Cheyenne 
Mountain in Colorado Springs. <img data-attachment-id="15257" data-permalink="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/batholith/dia-to-golden-colorado/" data-orig-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado.jpg" data-orig-size="1296,501" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="DIA to Golden, Colorado" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-720x278.jpg" data-large-file="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119201019/https://amallulla.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-1280x495.jpg" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-15257 size-full" src="%E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado.jpg" alt="" width="1296" height="501" srcset="%E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado.jpg 1296w, %E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-720x278.jpg 720w, %E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-1280x495.jpg 1280w, %E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-432x167.jpg 432w, %E2%84%96%2058.%20The%20multi-trillion-dollar%20granite%20tunnel%20system%20in%20the%20Pikes%20Peak%20batholith%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/DIA-to-Golden-Colorado-768x297.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px"></p>

 I don’t mean to suggest that the progeny of Jove killed almost 3,000 
people on September 11, 2001, because of a mine accident that happened 
112 years earlier in Golden, Colorado, but I most certainly do mean to 
suggest that is why they chose the date September 11. Of that, I am more

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">There
 are only a few short years left. The attack of September 11, 2001 was 
JFK all over again, which was the savage and very public murder of a 
President of the United States of American meant to let others know who 
was in control of this country. Only this time the message was sent to a
 much broader audience. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>This world belongs to the progeny of Jove. No one, not even Vladimir Putin should doubt this and put us all in jeopardy.</em></span> <em>The game is over. The progeny of Jove won.</em> Let us accept our fate.</p>
<p>The Chinese are too methodical in their approach to war to be a 
threat in the timeframe that matters, so basically you can reduce 9/11 
to a message to Vladimir Putin that if he does something stupid such as 
using his bullion reserves to reintroduce the gold-standard, <em>they will “dustify” the Kremlin while he is sitting in it</em>. Launching thermonuclear weapons before the 144,000 arrive in Denver is counterproductive and way too messy. <em>The order of the day is normalcy</em>.
 Politics, football, a scandal here and there, meaningless elections, 
the usual distractions. I’m quite sure Putin got the message. That’s why
 the Russians never exposed 9/11 for what it was, a domestic terrorist 
attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">The
 Masters of the Fiat Wizards have spoken. The Federal Reserve is the 
first thing they did after defeating the Freemasons of the South in a 
cunningly disguised, so-called “Civil War” and turned the United States 
of America into a corporation. Flirting with the idea of reintroducing 
the gold-standard as a backdoor to attacking them is suicidal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: x-large;">How
 far down was the White Ash Mine on September 9, 1889? I cannot help but
 to think the Eiffel Tower was used in Tomorrowland to help convey this 
idea. The mine was at 730 feet when it flooded. Mr. Eiffel’s apartment 
(pictured to the left) is at <em>285 méters du sol</em> or 935 feet above the ground. So the mine was roughly three-quarters of the Eiffel Tower’s height down into the ground.</p>

<p>I am being helped by several contributors whose names are pseudonyms.
 They know how grateful I am for their contributions. But there is 
someone else who is helping me now. They speak in numbers and symbols, 
the language of the progeny of Jove. I ignored their first two 
communications because I reasoned it could have been anyone, but their 
third communication evidenced knowledge way beyond what anyone but the 
progeny of Jove could know and involved a level of technical 
sophistication far surpassing what one might expect from someone whose 
only interest was in misguiding me. So forgive me if I overlook the 
tragic deaths of almost 3,000 people on September 11, 2001 and try to 
explain, not the purpose of demonstrating the potential destructiveness 
of their advanced technology, but the day on which they chose to do what
 they did. need to rethink this Odd Fellows position. everyone in that 
town would have known what the mine was four…I see no evidence the Off 
Fellows were somehow apart from the others The progeny of Jove, known as
 the Freemasons at the time or <em>Odd Fellows</em> (perhaps even to 
this day) lost four brothers that day 112 years ago and a fifth man who I
 cannot help but to think was very dear to them. I do not know if they 
held a memorial service in Golden, Colorado on September 11, 1889, or if
 that was the day the news “all hope of recovering the bodies of the 11 
drowned miners has been abandoned” reached their headquarters in New 
York City, but for whatever reason, that is the day on which the loss is
 remembered. If I wax poetic it is because my life is intertwined with 
theirs. I have never studied anything as much as I have the people I 
call the progeny of Jove. Because of this, I think I understand them 
better than a casual reader ever could. It wrenches my soul at times to 
put myself in their shoes and see the world as they do. In their own 
way, they are on a <em>mission from God</em> to quote the Blues 
Brothers. They are trying to save mankind. And over the centuries and 
millennia, they have come to see us as animals. Everyone and anyone is 
expendable. If ever there was an argument for<em> the end justifying the means</em>, <em>breaking this endless cycle of world-ending catastrophes throwing mankind back into the stone age</em> is it. <strong>My God! What happened to the builders of the Great Pyramid of Giza?</strong>
 Because I can damn well guarantee you they were more advanced than us 
in every conceivable respect. It is no easy thing the progeny of Jove 
hope to accomplish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: red; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">If
 they fail, we start all over again, first tribes, then cities, then 
nations, and all the time ceaseless warfare, losing precision time to 
develop the technology needed to escape this fatally flawed Solar System
 and find a new home among the stars before the next world-ending 
catastrophe.</p>
<p>It is self-evident in our “amnesia,” as Immanuel Velikovsky calls it,
 that this has been happening tens if not hundreds of thousands and 
quite possibly millions of years. These men are anything but stupid. I 
am sure it did not take long for them to realize the bodies of those 
miners were mangled beyond recognition long before they drowned and that
 they would be entombed beneath Golden, Colorado for an eternity. It was
 later discovered that the water that poured through from the Loveland 
mine was 140° Fahrenheit, and that was on the surface. It would have 
been at its hottest immediately after passing through the burning coal 
that separated the two mines. Those men did not drown. If the Freemason 
or Odd Fellow menfolk in Golden, Colorado said so, it was for the sake 
of grieving widows. I imagine that they collectively rededicated 
themselves to Virgil’s vision of a “Vault Profound” and, after a 
respectable period of mourning, went back to work more determined than 
ever to realize their vision of a Tomorrowland. But the sadness of that 
day has reverberated through time and touched all of our lives. Every 
time you dial 911 it is in memory of those miners that died on September
 9, 1889. What the progeny of Jove alive today don’t know is that a 
similar fate awaits all of them. Methinks the amperes that will surge 
through that granite batholith under the weight of the Pacific Ocean are
 immeasurable and cannot be overcome with any insulation <em>imaginable</em>.
 No matter how smart they think they are, their deaths will be as 
instantaneous as those ten miners they honored on September 11, 2001, 
when they took the lives of almost 3,000 people who had no idea what was
 really happening. The significance of the Rocky</p>
