 The “beast” is the coming Earth crustal displacement. This verse in the
 Bible is a reference to the timeframe in which the Fifth World will 
come to an end. Based on the work of George Dodwell, the axial tilt 
itself is a doomsday clock. 13 x 18 = 23.4° which is precisely the 
current axial tilt and has a complementary angle of 66.6°</span></p>

<p><em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em> consists of 108 pages, the 
ever-growing ASL library, and this homepage which has been completely 
rewritten four or five times now. You can be sure the content on this 
homepage is at the very heart of everything I have to say about the 
coming Earth crustal displacement. It may seem an odd introduction to 
the subject, but that is only because you are not “initiated” (read <em>clueless</em>). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I am describing a world about which you know nothing.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;
 9/11 was not a Muslim terrorist attack. It was not a domestic terrorist
 attack. The financial shenanigans were opportunistic, not the root 
cause. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><b style="color: #ff0000;">The destruction of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, and their </b><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>replacement</b></span><b style="color: #ff0000;">
 with a single “One Word” Trade Center tower was a banker celebration of
 the end time with symbolic roots dating back to the very beginnings of 
the Roman Republic.</b></em></span> It was something only a handful of 
people in the entire world really understand. I am one of them. But no 
one is listening. I have reconciled myself to this baffling reality. <em>It will not change.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>After learning what is on this homepage, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I personally no longer need any more convincing that the “apocalypse” is imminent</em></strong></span>. I am of the opinion that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>all three factions</em></strong></span> of the people I call the “progeny of Jove”—<em>the
 bankers who control the entire Western world, the Ћinkers who are 
descended from Sir Francis Bacon (your William Shakespeare) and the 
original Rosicrucians, but who are now primarily best thought of as a 
remnant of Freemasons in the South from before the Civil War, and the 
Jesuits and Black Pope</em>—sincerely believe an Earth crustal displacement will occur in the next year or so. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is enough for me.</em></strong></span>
 I often say this knowledge changes men. Now that my mind has fully 
accepted the reality that we are living in the end time and the time 
remaining me is measured in months, not years or decades, this knowledge
 is changing me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are fast approaching the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the highly
 symbolic destruction of the Twin Towers, and it was the precise moment 
when I learned that David Rockefeller announced the World Trade Center 
back in 1943 that I felt for the first time a deep and abiding 
conviction that all of this is real. That was a while ago and the 
conviction has remained with me ever since. Hence, this homepage will 
continue to showcase the 1943 announcement of the World Trade Center so 
long as <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em> exists. It was one of those 
extremely rare moments in history when the progeny of Jove in their 
haughty arrogance got careless and showed their hand. My prayer in 
showcasing the 1943 announcement of the World Trade Center by a young 
newlywed banker’s son is that the reader may come to realize the true 
significance of what happened on September 11, 2001. There are as many 
people in the world who understand what happened that day as there are 
people who understand the Georgia Guidestones. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And I really do not give a damn who you are, there is a better than 99.9% chance that you don’t know squat about either.</em></strong></span> You think you do, but you are most likely as ignorant about both as an Australian aborigine. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>You live in a pathetic ignorance so divorced from reality that reaching you is a hopeless cause.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;I am sorry if that sounds arrogant or harsh, but I assure you it is true.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the endless graffiti on the Georgia Guidestones, 
other men of far greater character than I have failed to capture the 
imagination of the people. Yet we must follow in the footsteps of the 
Nazarene,—the man countless millions thought was the Christ,—as well as 
the Bard and do as conscious demands. We must persist to the end in our 
efforts,—not to put pearls before swine,—but rather to awaken our fellow
 man from his endless gorging in a pig trough not of his making. That is
 our duty to God and man. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The 
struggle to perfect my writing of An Apocalyptic Synthesis will continue
 in the face of a blind indifference I know all too well.</em></strong></span>
 Every single day I see it in my website statistics. The one website the
 entire world should be flocking to in droves has about as much traffic 
as a gas station in the middle of a desert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one is listening because of the conceit of their minds. I see that clearly now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I no longer despair of it or delude myself into thinking I can overcome such profound ignorance.</em></strong></span> What I can say with authority is that <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">it will be as the Nazarene said it would be</span></em></strong>.
 They will not know what is happening until it is too late to save 
themselves. I carry with me this promise though; one of you will be by 
my side on Monjeau peak the morning after. I have thought about this a 
lot. To understand my decision to keep working on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>, you must allow yourself to see life from the perceptive of <em>the morning after</em>
 when our world has been completely erased by the Pacific Ocean, 
everything as far as the eye can see is a mud flat, and you are isolated
 on a mountain top with a handful of dazed and bewildered strangers some
 of whom do not even comprehend what just happened. Only then does what I
 am doing make sense. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In the 
face of such unimaginable destruction, I will gladly persist for the 
sake of that one man or woman who looked past my mistakes and listened 
to what I am saying.</em></strong></span> We will begin anew. We who heard that ancients screaming at us.</p>

indomitable conquerors. Those are the men who have certain knowledge of 
the end time and who are slated to enter the multitrillion dollar 
granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They walk as gods among us.</em></strong></span>
 For them, a new world awaits. For everyone else, I feel as though I can
 now speak with authority on this subject when I say you do not really 
want to know the truth. I have crossed that line. For years, I wrote 
what I saw, but in my heart it was an intellectual exercise, a challenge
 for my “thinker.” When eventually I began to see that it is a 
mathematical impossibility either <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that my mind could <span style="color: #ff0000;">fabricate</span>&nbsp;all of this</em></strong></span> or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that men are doing these things for any reason other than we really are living in the end time</em></strong></span>,
 I washed ashore on a remote desert island of thought, a castaway from 
the daily life of other human beings, left alone in an indescribable 
barrenness. “Conative dissonance” is a self-preservation mechanism. My 
“thinker” has kept me isolated from the world all my life, <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but nothing prepared me for this. Be sure you want to pursue this knowledge.&nbsp;</span></strong></em></p>

<p>The following excerpt from an article entitled <em>Mars</em> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.worldhistory.org/Mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>World History Encyclopedia</em></a> is written by Mark Cartwright who “is a history writer based in Italy.” As you will learn in the <span class="lwptoc_item_label">Apophenia Productions YouTube video below, t</span>he
 Twin Towers are the “twin trees” in Roman mythology. The one tree that 
“grew so large that it covered the entire world with its shade” is the 
“One World” Trade Center,—or rather what that building represents. And 
what that building represents is what I refer to as the <em>Unknown Entity</em>
 on this website, a group of men who have perfected the art of hiding 
from the public over a period of more than 900 years since the founding 
of the Knights Templar. Their identities are unknown to us because they 
hide behind need-to-know clearances that exclude even sitting 
presidents. They took control of the United States of America after the 
so-called Civil War. Since then, using the military forces of the United
 States of America, its intelligence services, the unconstrained power 
of fiat currency, major corporations—<em>including most significantly, mainstream media,</em>—and the corruptibility of elected officials within the Republican form of government (resulting in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/pedophilia/">rampant pedophilia</a>), <em>they now control not only the end-time infrastructure in and around Denver, Colorado </em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>but the entire Western world</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot appreciate all of this at the moment because you do not understand the scale of what is happening. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are tragically close to the end of the Fifth World in which you live.</em></strong></span> Your mind has been conditioned to reject the idea that the world is about to end, but that does not make it so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Mars, nevertheless, had some features which were uniquely Roman. 
Considered more level-headed than the often impulsive and disruptive 
Ares, Mars was also seen as a more virtuous figure by the more 
martial-oriented Romans.

<p>Mars was considered the father of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romulus and Remus</a>, the mythical twin founders of Rome.

 Silvia, was raped by Mars while she slept, and in her dreams she had a 
vision where she dropped a hairpin to the ground, and from which there 
sprang two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>twin trees</strong></span>.
 Over time one of the trees grew so large that it covered the entire

<p>The Old World bankers began life as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/knights/">Knights Templar</a>. If you do not know this, then you need to study the history of the Knights Templar. I am not speaking metaphorically. <em>This is straightforward history.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Knights Templar were the original bankers. They invented international banking.</em></strong></span> They got their seed money from underneath the so-called Temple Mount. It was the wealth of Israel buried there by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_X_Fretensis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legio X Fretensis</a> a millennia earlier after the Siege of Jerusalem. Because, before they were bankers, <em>they were the Roman elite</em>.
 And they learned what they know about the end time from the ancient 
Greeks who settled in Magna Graecia, first and foremost from Pythagoras.
 History is woven much tighter than most people realize. <em>For the past 2,600 years, it has been dominated by men who have specific knowledge about the end time.&nbsp;</em></p>

 challenge in writing this homepage is to make you understand that 
“9/11” was analogous to what happens every year at Bohemian Grove</em>,—
a one-off celebration of sorts to mark the end of the world. But not 
even that analogy comes close to the truth. Only a handful of people in 
this world <em>or the next</em> will ever fully comprehend what happened on that fateful day. If you want to be one of them, keep reading.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">My only prognostication</div>
<p>The truth behind the destruction of the World Trade Center is so 
profound that, once you fully grasp what really happened, you will 
arrive at the same conclusion as did I when the big picture came into 
focus.&nbsp; <em>And that conclusion is that we are at the threshold of something unimaginable.</em> I’m not talking years or decades from now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 people who know for sure what is going to happen, who have inherited 
specific knowledge about the end time from a previous world age, are 
saying this going to happen in the next year or so</em></strong>. </span></p>
<div class="impact-72">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">what</span> and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">when</span> of the apocalypse or “day of the Lord” is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Earth crustal displacement</span> most likely in the year <span style="color: #ff0000;">2022</span>, but no later than December 31, 2024. In other words, <span style="color: #ff0000;">January 1, 2025, does not happen</span>.&nbsp;</div>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Not about money</div>
<p>What has become known as “9/11” was not about asbestos abatement, 
insurance fraud, the Hammer Fund, or the great rubble scam,—all of which
 are discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It was not about money at all</em></strong></span>
 except to the extent that the character of bankers is such that it only
 made sense for them to profit from their foreknowledge of events. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But planning for what you know of as “9/11” began long before any of these financial shenanigans were put into motion.</em></strong></span>
 To think otherwise, would be to seriously underestimate what motivates 
the bankers. One thing writing this website has taught me is not to 
judge any of the players involved. We are facing sure death. Judging 
those destined to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement is best 
left to Enoch and the so-called prophets. You need to focus on awakening
 to this new reality in time to save yourself, your spouse or other 
loved one, and your children. However poorly written at the moment,

<h2><span id="The_progeny_of_Jove">The progeny of Jove</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">The term <em>progeny of Jove</em>,—borrowed from Virgil’s <em>Eclogue IV</em>
 at top of this page,—refers to people who have specific knowledge about
 the end time. There are primarily two factions. One is the Old World 
bankers who took control of this country in the so-called Civil War. The
 other is an even more fascinating story that involves no less than the 
man you know as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright not the actor) and the two secret societies he and his followers founded. Those are the <em>historical</em> Rosicrucians and the Freemasons in the South.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Three factions</div>
<ul><li><span class="entry">The Bankers</span>: They began life as the 
Roman elite and after the fall of the Roman Empire resurfaced as the 
Knights Templar,—the original Old World bankers. Of all three factions, 
their lineage is the most direct and as such is somewhat defined by 
bloodlines. The bankers have only ever become richer and more powerful 
through the centuries.</li>
<li><span class="entry">The Ћinkers</span>: While there is indeed a long
 tradition of Ћinkers which can be rightly said to date back to the 
ancient Greeks and most definitely includes the papal architects and 
alchemists, on this website the term <em>Ћinkers</em> primarily refers 
to a very special group of men led by one man who you know of as William
 Shakespeare (the playwright, not the actor) in Elizabethan England over
 400 years ago now. His real name was&nbsp;Sir Francis Bacon. They 
started the historical Rosicrucians and the Freemasons who founded the 
United States of America. Their continuity from the time of the 
Rosicrucian manifestos through to the Civil War was unbroken <em>but defined by the character of the men, not bloodlines</em>.
 A dedicated remnant of the Ћinkers is responsible for all of the 
end-time warnings people have been ignoring for years now, including the
 all-important Georgia Guidestones and a slew of movies including <em>The Black Hole</em>, <em>Virus</em> (1980), <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>Tomorrowland,</em> and <em>The Walk </em>discussed below. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They have been trying to warn us about the coming Earth crustal displacement for over 400 years now.</em></strong></span> No one listened to them either. The <span class="entry">Ћinkers</span> identify themselves in one of three ways; with the more subtle number <strong><em>55</em></strong>, with the number <em>58</em> when paying homage to Sir Francis Bacon’s mother, Queen Elizabeth I, and with the initials <strong><em>MM</em></strong>, which corresponds to 13 13 in simple English gematria, in matters regarding the Georgia Guidestones and the Stone of Destiny.</li>
<li><span class="entry">The Jesuits and Black Pope</span>: Originally, 
the Jesuits were the bankers taking control of the church apparatus in 
Rome as payback for the papal bull Vox in excelso. However, once in 
control of the Roman Catholic Church, the Jesuits and Black Pope became 
something so ugly that the bankers eventually had to reassert themselves
 to regain control of a world increasingly enslaved by the Roman 
Catholic Church. They could conceive of nothing more than a world in 
which they knew everything and everyone else was hopelessly ignorant of 
the truth. They had no loyalties outside of Rome. For this reason, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the Jesuits and Black Pope are regarded as a third faction within the progeny of Jove</em></strong></span>. The Ћinkers were born fighting the Roman Catholic Church in Elizabethan England. Were it not for the resistance of both <em>the bankers and the Ћinkers</em>, the whole world may have become as lost as is Central and South America today. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>For this, we owe them a debt of gratitude.</em></span></strong>
 According to no less than Abraham Lincoln, the Jesuits played a part in
 instigating the Civil War, but beyond that, they do not seem to be of 
any great consequence. They do own one of the most special libraries on 
the planet. We can only hope they have taken measures to assure the 
survival of those manuscripts and books.&nbsp;</li>

Who are the progeny of Jove?</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The bankers are oblivious to what the Ћinkers are doing</div>
<p>Here I want to say something I’ve never said before. The longer I 
study these two groups of men, the more sure I become that their 
relationship is not unlike the Ћinkers and the Jesuits during the time 
in which the cathedrals were built. Here it is important to realize that
 the Jesuits <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>are</em></strong></span> the bankers. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medici family</a> are consummate bankers. The first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes_from_the_Medici_family" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medici Pope</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pope Leo X</a>.
 He was ordained priest on 15 March 1513. Two days later he was 
consecrated as bishop. And in what I can only speculate may be yet 
another reference to 2022, two days later again on the 19th of March, 
1513, he was crowned Pope. The Jesuits were then founded on August 15, 
1534, and have been in control of the Roman Catholic Church ever 
since.&nbsp;The Ћinkers—more specifically, the architects for the 
papacy—were used to get inside the church <em>at the very same time the symbolism on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_cathedrals_and_churches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic cathedrals</a> was a mockery of Catholicism</em>. The bankers had no idea what was happening. As you will see in the following section about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Paper_Company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Paper Company</a>, founded in the Ohio River Valley, where the bankers were before Colorado (as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/presidents/">№ 51. Freemason Presidents and the Ohio River Valley</a>), this obliviousness on the part of the bankers has never stopped. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I do not mean to imply that they are stupid. They are just too busy to notice what is happening.</em></strong></span>
 Where the bankers I think would take action if they knew any better is 
that the Ћinkers always have “a man on the inside.” They always have 
detailed foreknowledge of anything the bankers are planning to do. That 
was true when the gothic cathedrals were built and it was true all 
during the planning of 9/11 and Covid-19. However, with the notable 
exception of the rather in-your-face Georgia Guidestones for which they 
provided a credible cover story—one the whole world bought into—the 
Ћinkers are always mindful to not be too obvious. Were it otherwise, I 
would not put it past the bankers to burn down Atlanta a second time.</p>
<p>I think an appreciable percentage of what I discuss on this website 
was never intended for the public, and especially not for the bankers. 
If that is so, it may explain why my website has not been shut down. And
 here is what I want to say, it may also explain why the Ћinkers will 
not acknoledge my work, and may in fact be hindering me. As I have said 
elsewhere on this website, I sent my full name and contact information 
to every Royal Arch Freemason lodge in the South. I did so because I do 
not like the feeling that I am hiding from anyone. I am not. The only 
reason this website does not have my name on it is because I don’t want 
the hassle of unwanted phone calls and emails, not to mention the 
possibility of a visit to my house.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Commonalities</div>
<p>The bankers and the Ћinkers share two things in common. One is 
that—in what might be described as a Pythagorian tradition—they worship 
numbers and therefore share a common compulsion to numerically sign 
their work. This is their greatest weakness and how I have learned most 
of what I know about them. The other is that they make movies, but for 
completely different reasons. The bankers make movies for the purpose of
 molding the thought of the masses. None come more readily to mind than <em>2001: A Space Odessy</em>
 which prepared an unsuspecting public for Moon landings that never 
occurred. Now they seem to be preparing us for a viral pandemic much 
more serious than COVID-19. This is sometimes referred to as <em>predictive programming</em>.
 The Ћinkers make movies for the sole purpose of trying to 
enlighten,—not the general public,—but their own, what they call the <em>initiated</em>.
 I eavesdrop on those communications. Primarily what this means is 
telling us who is responsible for 9/11 and what exactly is about to 
happen. For example, because of these not-so-well-hidden communications,
 we know what to expect is an Earth crustal displacement most probably 
in the year 2022. And we know who is responsible for 9/11. Why? Why is 
“9/11” so important? Because 9/11 is to the bankers what the Georgia 
Guidestones and <em>Tomorrowland</em> are to the Ћinkers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are all what I like to think of as end-time markers.</em></strong></span>
 It’s not a blame game the Ћinkers are playing. They are trying to show 
us the big picture. They want us to think about why these things are 
happening. As I said above, men do not do the things such as destroying 
the World Trade Center with advanced directed energy weapons unless the 
destruction about to be visited on this planet is imminent.&nbsp;That is
 the overarching message of the Georgia Guidestones and in all of the 
movies made by the Ћinkers.</p>

<div class="intro">The “deep state” versus the Matrix</div>
<p>This is not a “deep state.” <em>The concept of a “deep state” wants for imagination.</em>
 This is a cabal of men who in the end time are now hiding behind 
need-to-know clearances and who are in control of the entire Western 
world. We don’t know who they are. We never will. Not even the president
 of the United States of America has a clue who these guys are. I am 
utterly convinced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wachowskis</a>, who wrote and directed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Matrix</a>
 movie, did so because they wanted to artistically convey the reality of
 what I discuss on this website. Over a period of 700 years since the 
Vox in excelso was issued, the progeny of Jove have perfected hiding 
from the public. And many <em>if not most</em> of them live in Colorado <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>because
 now is not a good time to have distance between you and the 
promised(land) protection of the Pikes Peak batholith.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Prior to this date, the Solar System was unsettled. There was never an 
opportunity for people to think of much more than their own survival.</p>
<p>Thousands of years earlier in a time now remembered as the Younger Dryas</p>
<p>From the time of the breakup of the polar configuration which</p>

<p>We have just experienced 2750 years of relative calm (747 BC + 2018 
AD). Why do I use the date 747 BC? The answer to this question is 
pivotal to understanding my work. It took me years to piece this 
together. Here is the main point:</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;"><strong>Because of the Bible’s “Exodus” and the popularity of Immanuel Velikovsky’s <em>Worlds in Collision</em>, it is not generally understood that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the destructions of Mars far in exceeded anything prior to it</span>.</strong></p>
<p>It was only sometime after 687 BC when Mars assumed its present orbit
 that the ancients realized there would be this prolonged period of 
stability and calm in the solar system. It was an unimaginable period of
 enlightenment and knowledge of these cycles of destruction were much 
more widely dispersed. The “Progeny of Jove” date back to this period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like to refer to this period of time generically as 600 BC (or 
2,600 years ago). The people who survived the last two catastrophes (or 
“closing acts” of a cosmic drama as Immanuel Velikovsky calls them), 
most notably the Phrygians in Central Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), 
brought forward into the new world in which we now live ancient 
knowledge about these natural cycles of destruction that ended the 
previous world. This is the knowledge that the <em>progeny of Jove</em> possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MMMMMM</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Knowledge of the cyclic destruction of the planet was widespread back then.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>These are perhaps not ordinary men speaking, but they are nonetheless men:</strong></span></p>

<p>XXXXThe “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/nine/#the-master-plan">Master Plan</a>”
 was already formulated in the days of the ancient Greeks. Its origins 
date back to the Phrygians who survived our many encounters with Mars in
 vast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/phrygians/">underground cities in Central Anatolia</a> (modern-day Turkey).</p>
<p>All of these great men in history date back to this time period when 
knowledge of what the Bible calls the coming “Apocalypse” was more 
widely dispersed than it is today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-stretch: expanded; font-size: xx-large;">They inherited this knowledge from their ancestors who survived whatever happened in 3100 BC, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>a mere 500 years ago then</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They know what caused it then and more or less exactly what to expect this cycle. And equally important, when</strong></span>.</p>

<p>An artist rendition of the planets in what has become known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>polar configuration</em></strong></span>. The red planet closest to Earth is Mars. Venus is the white planet. The large planet is Proto-Saturn (no rings). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The planets were thought of a “gods” because they loomed large in the sky.</strong></span>
 After the polar configuration disintegrated, the comet Venus and Mars 
initially assumed orbits which brought them in very close proximity to 
Earth. This is the subject of Immanuel Velikovsky’s book <em>Worlds in Collision</em>, a seminal work in the field of comparative mythology.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Mars was the Last of the Planet Gods</span><br>During
 this period a series of close encounters with Mars separated by 15 
years caused even more destruction than the comet Venus and was 
punctuated by the February 26, 747 BC encounter in which Mars bumped up 
against Earth’s magnetosphere and changed our planet’s orbital period 
from a perfect 360 days to 365.2422 days. The Maya remember these 
“unlucky” five days as the Wayeb. The last of these encounters was 60 
years later on March 23, 687 BC (which is easy to remember because Mars 
also has a 687 day orbital period).</p>
<p>Mars is the closing act in Immanuel Velikovsky’s “cosmic drama,” discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sequence/">№ 36. The Hidden Catastrophic History of Our Solar System</a>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but it is a very climactic ending</strong></span>.
 Very few people understand that the repeated close encounters with Mars
 caused considerably more death and destruction than the comet Venus.</p>
<p>By the time Pythagoras is born c. 570 AD, Mars, the god of war and <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the last of the planet gods</strong></span></em> has already settled into its present-day, distant orbit and become yet another “wandering star.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It
 is my contention that around this time the ancients realized that their
 descendants would never understand or believe the destructive nature of
 the Solar System in which they live</span>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-size: 47px;"><strong>This was the impetus that gave birth, not to the Roman Empire, but to<em> <span style="color: #ff0000;">the progeny of Jove</span></em>, who were the elite, ruling classes in both Classical Greece and the Roman Empire.</strong></span></p>

 general and for the sake of simplicity, I refer to this period as 600 
B.C. or 2,600 years ago. It is only three generations or so after the 
last encounter with Mars. The Solar System has stabilized for the first 
time in the 2,500 years since Proto-Saturn exploded and flooded the 
Earth with water which, thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassini spacecraft</a>, we now know has the same isotopic ratios of Saturn’s rings. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It happened</span>.
 Our Solar System’s catastrophic past is real. Knowledge of these cycles
 of destruction and their cause was widespread back then. They inherited
 this knowledge from their ancestors who survived the “biblical deluge” 
in 3100 BC, a mere 500 years earlier.</p>
<p>So figuratively looking back over their shoulders into the 
not-so-distant past, they can readily recall two and a half millennia of
 unimaginable death and destruction raining down from the skies above. 
But looking forward, in this new, placid Solar System configuration in 
which the “gods” have been reduced to “wandering stars,” they begin to 
realize that little can be done to keep these memories alive. They 
possess specific knowledge from previous world ages (as attested to by 
the numerous quotes above) of these cycles of destruction and know more 
or less when to expect the next planetary catastrophe. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And they know this is “the big one,”</strong></span>
 which for reasons unknown to you and me, Joel describes by saying 
“there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, 
even to the years of many generations” and that eight centuries later 
the learned Nazarene (Christ Jesus) describes by saying “then shall be 
great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to 
this time, no, nor ever shall be.”</p>
<p>The problem is that it will not occur for another 2,600 years. By 
then the people will never believe them if they tried to explain the 
level of devastation which they know all too well is not only possible 
but the unavoidable and predetermined end of this world. The progeny of 
Jove made it their mission in life not only to preserve this knowledge 
intact, but to plan how to survive such an unimaginably devastating 
planetary catastrophe. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>For more than two and a half millennia they have been planning how to survive the next planetary catastrophe.</em></strong></span> Along the way they became what I routinely describe a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>brilliant, consummate planners</strong></span>. We find the idea of multigenerational planning hard to accept, but for them it is a way of life.</p>

<p>Here I just want to interject that Joel and the Nazarene (see below),
 whose description of what is about to happen was spoken some eight 
centuries later, sound remarkably the same. Between these two men, there
 is <em>zero possibility that the total destruction of the planet to 
which they are referring has already happened in the intervening time</em>.</p>

<p><span class="entry" style="font-size: 40px;">Isaiah</span>: Dating is
 highly problematic. “While it is widely accepted that the book of 
Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the 
Kingdom of Judah during the <span style="background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: bold;">8th century BCE</span>, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah.” (Wikipedia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Book of Isaiah</a>).
 “It must suffice here to give a few hints as to the probable periods of
 the chief prophecies. Three great national crises called forth the most
 certainly genuine prophecies of Isaiah—the Syro-Israelitish invasion (<span style="background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: bold;">734</span>), the siege and fall of Samaria (<span style="background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: bold;">722</span>), and the campaign of Sennacherib (<span style="background-color: #ffff00; font-weight: bold;">701</span>).
 Among the non-Isaian prophecies, there are two exilic prophecies of the
 fall of Babylon (xiii. 1-xiv. 23, and, as most suppose, xxi. 1-10); a 
probably post-exilic prophecy, or elegy, on the ruin of Moab (xv.-xvi.);
 prophecies on Egypt and on Tyre, both post-exilic, and the former 
furnished with a late appendix belonging to the Greek period. ”

<p>It is my strongly held belief, and indeed a central thesis of this 
entire website, that The Book of Daniel is not only a fictional work, 
but written by the progeny of Jove. It is therefore interesting that 
this “prophecy” is so different from the others. The “since there was a 
nation” is an <em>antediluvian</em> reference to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/scofield/">3100 B.C.</a>, when Proto-Saturn exploded and flooded the entire Earth.</p>
<p>The Jews will be infiltrated (as were the Christians many centuries later) and made to forget what is about to happen.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">These two men lived at about the same 
time. They are outside of the 350-year timeframe under consideration, 
but I am including them as a reminder that the progeny of Jove is now in
 control of the Roman Empire and it is generally not acceptable to 
discuss what is going to happen. It has been a secret for over half a 
millennium now and the Romans are systematically destroying cultures 
such as the Carthaginians (the remnant of the Phoenicians) and Druids 
whose knowledge encompasses the end time.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">These two numbers always refer to the same two dates. Skull and Bones or <em>The Brotherhood of Death</em>
 was never anything more than a recruiting ground for the bankers. Long 
before Yale or the United States of America even existed, on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>March 22, 1312</em></strong></span>, Pope Clement V issued the papal bull <em>Vox in excelso</em> abolishing the Knights Templar. It was subsequently approved by the Council of Vienne on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>April 3, 1312</em></strong></span>. What followed was more gruesome than most people could even imagine. Relative to today’s bankers, <em>these were good men</em>. Their crime? All they had done was escort a few pilgrims to Jerusalem and improve the economy of all of Europe. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Vox in excelso was a betrayal of the first order.</strong></span></em>
 And mankind has been paying in blood for the sins of the Roman Catholic
 Church in their acquiescence to a petty French tyrant ever since.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">A call to arms</div>
<p>The numbers 322 and 43 are used by the bankers to identify themselves because the original Old World bankers <em>were</em> the Knights Templar. What most people do not realize is that—unlike the Ћinkers—<em>the bankers are a largely unbroken lineage that has only ever increased in wealth and power over the past 900 years</em>. The bankers never forget. And they never forgive. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>These two dates have always been a call to arms for them. </em></strong></span>
 It should be said that, in reference to what happened to the Knights 
Templar on March 22 and April 3, 1312, the numbers 322 and 43 are more 
than 700 years old now and of a greater historical pedigree than the 
more famous 32° and 33° of Freemasonry. The latter two numbers are of no
 greater antiquity than 400 years.</p>
<div class="intro">The so-called Civil War</div>
<p>One of the more controversial pages on this website is page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/civil-war/">№ 54. Civil War and the fall of Freemasonry in the South</a>.
 The author has been verbally bludgeoned by Civil War enthusiasts for 
such radical thoughts as General Grant was a traitor to the South and 
ordered Picket’s Charge to protect the U.S. Capital, President Abraham 
Lincoln was not only a Rosicrucian, but a Southern sympathizer, the 
Gettysburg Address was so short because it was an encoded message of 
encouragement for the rank and file in the South, and more broadly that 
this was actually a war between the Freemasons of the South and the Old 
World bankers who were at the time posing as the European Illuminati, an
 organization that successfully infiltrated the Freemasons and started 
the Northern Jurisdiction in 1813 for the specific purpose of putting 
one of their own in the White House, instigating a war, and taking 
control of the United States of America. Yet this is the truth. I cannot
 and will not apologize for offending the sensibilities of deluded men 
who spend their lives debating inconsequential details ad infinitum 
about of subject of which they in fact know nothing.</p>
<p>President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Buchanan</a> 1857-1861 (Pennsylvania) was a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://lodge43.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lodge No. <strong>43</strong>, Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>. As discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/presidents/">№ 51. Freemason Presidents and the Ohio River Valley</a>,
 before Denver, Colorado was taken over by the bankers, the power base 
in the North was the Ohio River Valley, where the Roswell debris was 
initially sent. Their choice of what I characterize as a 
Philadelphia-based (read <em>Northern Jurisdiction</em>) Freemason <em>front-man</em> to instigate the Civil War is one thing. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>That he was a member of a lodge numbered 43 I now think was infinitely more significant from a symbolic perspective.</em></span></strong>
 In essence, what it says is something along the lines of “It’s time to 
get serious. We can no longer afford the niceties of the Freemasonry.”

 Take the time to acquaint yourself with the real history of the United 
States of America. You will not find it in a book. Of that, I am quite 
sure.</p>

<div class="intro">43 on the Rebis woodcut</div>
<p>But do these numbers have other meanings? I ask this question because of the number 43 on the highly important “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebis</a>” woodcut above. It took me months of hard work to be able to answer this question. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Surprisingly, the answer is no.</em></strong></span>
 These are exclusively banker’s numbers. If you are wondering why 43 
appears of the Rebis woodcut, I’ve moved that discussion to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/#Other_meanings_of_the_number_43"><em>Other meanings of the number 43</em></a>. By the way, the dragon in the Rebis woodcut <em>is</em> the bankers. It is from this Rosicrucian woodcut that the Freemasons took their Square and Compasses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should never doubt that the bankers are dedicated to their cause. <span style="font-size: 36px; color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And it is a noble one.</em></strong></span>Despite all of our human frailties, thanks to <em>providence</em>
 (the second and lesser-known meaning of which is simply “timely 
preparation for future eventualities”), they are prepared to survive the
 coming apocalypse. Their “vault profound” is everything Virgil imagined
 it would be and more. But these are the very same men responsible for 
Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg in the so-called Civil War. If their 
unmitigated savagery in countless other wars—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>all of which they started</em></strong></span>—
from the genocide of Native Americans to Vietnam and Iraq and what 
happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City ever makes you stop and
 wonder at the cruelty of such men, the numbers 322 and 43 are the 
answer you seek. Do I condone this wholesale slaughter of human beings? 
No, <em>but I have come to understand it</em>. It is true that the bankers regard us as the walking dead. But there are always two sides to every story. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The balance you must seek is an understanding of what is at stake.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>If these guys succeed in saving all of our technology—which technology I can promise you based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/#The_2243_minute_MP3_recording_from_the_Walt_Disney_Pictures_Tomorrowland_movie">MP3 recordings</a> released as part of the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie exceeds your wildest expectations—in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system</a>
 in the Pikes Peak batholith, we will find a more suitable planet to 
inhabit for the long-term survival of human beings, Earth will become 
something akin to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.startrek.com/database_article/risa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Risa</a>
 in Star Trek where people spend their vacations, and countless 
generations of human beings from then on will know nothing but peace and
 prosperity. What cost is too high to achieve this reality when the 
alternative is that we reboot as cavemen and go through this entire 
sadistic “history” of tribes, nations, and empires all over again? 
Mankind will not reboot as cavemen. Not this time. Not if the bankers 
succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Poetic license</div>
<p>Allow me the freedom to describe to you what I imagine is the 
symbolic meaning of 322 and 43 to the bankers.&nbsp;These are my words, 
but I am nevertheless using a quote block.</p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>“We are on a mission. We saw into the depth of the human character when faced with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>endless betrayals</em></strong></span> in France. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What
 we learned there is that this mission cannot be compromised by the 
vagaries of petty tyrants such as King Philip IV of France and 
unprincipled churchmen such as Pope Clement V</em></strong></span>. Men 
who would jeopardize the future of all mankind for vein glory are a 
threat to the species, and we will not suffer such fools. Henceforth we 
will use the knowledge we gained in establishing the first global 
banking system to gain control of the entire Western World. And we will 
be as ruthless with our enemies as were these two men to our leaders, 
who they coated with grease and then roasted alive, like pigs on a spit.
 Get in our way <em>and you die</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why?</em> I would ask. <em>Why treat all mankind with the same contempt you hold for these two men who betrayed your leaders so long ago?</em></p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>“Because we do not have time for the foolishness of this world. Our 
purpose in life is to prevent mankind from rebooting as cavemen. It is 
self-evident that this has never before been achieved or else mankind 
would not suffer from amnesia. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are focused on the survival of the species.</em></strong></span>
 We have been furiously working towards this goal since well before May 
1, 1776. And now we control everything. So I say again, get in our way 
and you will die,—or worse.”</p>

<div class="intro">Letting the people know</div>
<p>Why don’t the bankers tell the people what is happening? This issue was tackled very astutely by the Ћinkers in the movie <em>2012</em>.
 I spent an entire evening very judiciously isolating all of the clips 
involved in this imaginary exchange between the bankers and the thinkers
 on the issue of telling the people the apocalypse is real and “at our 
doorstep” to quote the Nazarene. Think of these scenes as a 
philosophical debate between the two main factions of the progeny of 
Jove. Of course, bankers don’t make such movies, so this is a Ћinker 
presentation,—but one that does reasonably well at presenting both sides
 of the debate. I hate doing video work. It is very tedious and slow. 
But when I saw all of these scenes so carefully cut and sewn back 
together again as one, I deemed it a worthy effort.</p>

<div class="intro" style="margin-top: 0;">The bottomless pit</div>
<p>The bankers may not be as omnipotent as they think though. In a world
 where movie runtimes are used to convey meaning, it is interesting to 
note that at <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>precisely</em></strong></span> 1:08:00 minutes into the <em>2012</em>
 movie the words “The Yellowstone caldera has erupted” are spoken. 108 
is one of the most important of all the sacred numbers. The Ћinkers 
don’t do these kinds of things to entertain you. They are telling you 
something they know. I am sure that the bankers have “escape” tunnel 
boring machines (TBM) preposition to bore back to the surface for this 
eventuality, but I wonder to what extent they have really planned on 
this happening. A mere 500 miles separate the Yellowstone supervolcano 
and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, which is the front door to Virgil’s “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">vault profound</a>” hiding in plain sight. But the prevailing winds favor them and so may the fates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stanley Kubrick eventually crossed the line and sacrificed his life trying to tell us the truth about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/moon/">Apollo program</a>.
 But that was not all he was trying to tell us. What people do not know 
is that he started trying to tell us as early as the production of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> with his waving flag in a closed room, mirrored images on visors, and most particularly, with the release date of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>April 3</strong></em></span>,
 1968. Seen in the correct light, this use of 43 is as significant as 
any other use discussed on this website. And what is the correct light? <em>Listen to me, please.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Stanley Kubrick knows the meaning of 43.</em></strong></span> He is using the release date of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>
 to tell us who is behind the movie. And by extension, he is telling us 
who is behind the Apollo program. This is how people talk using the 
symbolic meaning of numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">The Brotherhood of Death</div>
<p>Their first two victims were King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/templars-curse-king-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Archives</a>,
 “The Pope’s body was placed in a church overnight and the church caught
 fire and the body turned to ashes.” These are the two men who were 
primarily responsible to what happened to the Knights Templar in France.
 But have there been others? Oh my god. <span style="font-size: 36px; color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Yes!!</em></strong></span>&nbsp; Page&nbsp;<a style="font-size: 36px;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/jfk/">№ 4.

<div class="intro">The game is over</div>
<p>I pay homage to the Ћinkers,—as rightly I should,—by routinely saying
 their impact on the daily lives of people who live in the United States
 of America is <em>inestimable</em>, even though no one is aware of it. 
But the truth is they pale in significance to the impact of the bankers 
on the lives of people <em>all over the world</em>. At this point in history, they probably regard the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em> with their Georgia Guidestones and endless movies as little more than a curiosity.&nbsp;<em>The game is over,</em> as I am fond of saying. <span style="font-size: 36px; color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The bankers won.</em></strong></span>
 They are in control of the Pikes Peak batholith and the 
multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system—a highly symbolic 40 miles 
west of Denver, Colorado in the Front Range. But they are in control of 
much more than the end-time survival apparatus. They control not only 
the military and government of the United States of America but through 
the power of major corporations and the corruptibility of businessmen 
and government officials, fiat currency manipulation by the <em>Wi<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ω</span>ards of Fiat Currency</em> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/central/">Federal Reserve System</a>,
 a small army of propagandists and “hackers” (this is a technically 
incorrect use of the term) who are fighting to maintain control of the 
Frankenstein monster they created called <em>the Internet</em> (in a war
 I fear they are going to lose), and even the Republican form of 
government the created which inevitably—and I would argue by 
design—fosters centralized control and assures only a handful of

<h2><span id="Vox_in_excelso_A_voice_from_on_high">Vox in excelso (A voice from on high)</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Before continuing, I want to take a 
closer look at Vox in excelso. Far too little attention is given to this
 papal bull. Why? Because it happened a long time ago. Yet this papal 
bull defines both 322 and 43, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>two numbers that pervade our current reality over 700 years later</em></strong></span>. As I write this, I realize I may have failed the reader somewhat in my definition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/website/#The_five_fundamental_principles_of_An_Apocalyptic_Synthesis"><em>The five fundamental principles of An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em></a>. There should have been a sixth. <em>The progeny of Jove do not perceive time as other human beings do.</em>
 Their knowledge of the coming destruction of the planet dates back to a
 previous world age. Organizationally, I feel more than confident in 
saying they began their quest for world dominance not long after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/time/">March 23, 687 BC</a>, which is believed to be our planet’s last close encounter with <mark>Mars</mark>
 before the latter settled into its current orbit. We know Mars is what 
gave birth to the Roman Empire, the origins of the bankers, but the 
timing also suggests the beginnings of the Ћinkers in that by 532 BC 
Pythagoras is already establishing his school in Magna Graecia.&nbsp;So 
when I tell you planning for the destruction of the World Trade Center 
began at the very latest in 1943 or that planning for the Georgia 
Guidestones began no later than in the aftermath of the Civil War, what 
does it say when the average reader recoils at such a suggestion? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In
 the hands of the progeny of Jove, time is a tool for hiding messages 
precisely because they count on this predictable reaction.</em></strong></span> My point in the context of this particular discussion is that <em>Vox in excelso</em>
 has defined your life more than you can possibly know. Hence, you 
really should take the time to learn a little more about this papal bull
 and the historical context in which it was issued by Pope Clement V.</p>

<div class="intro">The need to control governments</div>
<p>My reason for wanting to do so is to emphasize that the lesson of <em>Vox in excelso</em>
 for the bankers is the need to control governments. This papal bull was
 not so much the work of the Roman Catholic Church as it was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Philip IV of France</a>.

<div class="intro">Sovereign power</div>
<p>As you will discover shortly, the author of the above work does not understand the papal bull <em>Vox in excelso</em>.
 He thinks it “dissolved the order of the Temple.” This is a common 
misconception and one that is repeated in the Wikipedia article. The 
following author is extraordinary in his ability to <em>correctly</em> interpret the events unfolding in France in the early 13th century. If you read the whole <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://commanderysaintmichael.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/templars-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Templar’s Survival</a></em>
 article, which I highly recommend, you will see that the author is 
somewhat perplexed by the fact that the Knights Templar are seemingly 
oblivious to Pope Clement V’s attempts to reconcile the church with the 
Knights Templar. <em>This too is part of the story.</em> There will be no forgiveness and no forgetting of these <em>unholy betrayals</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Never.</em></strong></span> And there never were. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Two centuries later the bankers took control of the papacy in Rome.</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">In 1312 AD, Pope Clement V issued the Papal Bull&nbsp;<em>Vox in Excelso</em>&nbsp;
(“Voice From on High”), for final resolution of the status of the 
Knights Templar. This famous Papal Bull is typically claimed and widely 
believed to have “dissolved” the Order, and even proponents of 
Templarism describe it more softly, but still mistakenly, as having 
“suspended” the Order. The historical record, however, proves that in 
fact it merely “suppressed” the Templars, which is a very limited and 
purely political move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">Even Vatican scholars rarely cite the 
original text of the Papal Bull, instead referring to Vatican records 
which describe it being read aloud to the Council of Vienne. Those 
references routinely note that it was read under the overbearing 
presence of the French King Philip IV and his three sons. The official 
records state the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">“<em>The Pope said that though he had <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">no sufficient reasons for a formal condemnation of the Order</span></strong>,
 nevertheless, because of… the hatred borne them by the King of France, 
the scandalous nature of their trial, and the probable dilapidation of 
the Order’s property in every Christian land, he<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">suppressed it by virtue of his sovereign power, and not by any definitive sentence</span></strong></em>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">Declaring that there were “no 
sufficient reasons”, and that it was “not by definitive sentence”, 
clearly emphasized that it had no real legal effect. All official 
statements consistently highlight (and thereby protest) the pressure and
 interference from the French King, indicating that the resulting Papal 
Bull would be necessarily null and void by the legal doctrine of 
“duress”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 32px;">By
 the operative key words “suppressed it by virtue of his sovereign 
power”, Pope Clement V revealed the true legal context ofVox in Excelso:</span></em></strong></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="wp-h1"><span style="font-size: 32px;"><big>Council of Vienne</big></span></p>
<hr class="wp-hr"><p><span style="font-size: 32px;">The Council of 
Vienne was the fifteenth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church that 
met between 1311 and 1312 in Vienne, France. Its principal act was to 
withdraw papal support for the Knights Templar on the instigation of 
Philip IV of France, after the French monarch attacked Rome and killed 
Pope Boniface VIII (Attack at Agnani).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">…</span></p>
<p class="wp-h1"><span style="font-size: 32px;">The decisions taken</span></p>
<hr class="wp-hr"><p><span style="font-size: 32px;">The acts of the Council have disappeared, with the exceptions of a fragment in a manuscript in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Library</a>
 in Paris, and of the financial documents of the Templars that were 
requisitioned. The work of the Council was not done in plenary session, 
but a commission was appointed to examine these official records 
concerning the order, with a smaller committee of archbishops and 
bishops presided over by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Aquileia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archbishop of Aquileia</a>,
 which was to examine exhaustively the official records and the 
abstracts. The pope and the cardinals negotiated with the members of 
this commission respecting the matter. A commission of cardinals was 
also appointed in order to investigate grievances and proposals advanced
 on the subject of church reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">A majority of the cardinals and nearly
 all the members of the commission were of the opinion that the Order of
 Knights Templar should be granted the right to defend itself, and that 
no proof collected up to then was sufficient to condemn the order of the
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heresy</a> of which it was accused by Philip’s ministry, without straining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canon law</a>. The discussion of Knights Templar was then put in abeyance. The topic changed to the need for an expedition to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holy Land</a> and about the reform of ecclesiastical morals.

<p><span style="font-size: 32px;">In February 1312 envoys from the 
Philip IV negotiated with the Pope without consulting the Council, and 
Philip held an assembly in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>
 to put further pressure on the Pope and the Council. Philip IV went to 
Vienne on 20 March. Clement was forced to adopt the expedient of 
suppressing the Order of Knights Templar, not by legal method (<i>de jure</i>), but on the grounds of the general welfare of the Church and by Apostolic ordinance (<i>per modum provisionis seu ordinationis apostolicae</i>). The Pope gave to the commission of cardinals for approval the bull to suppress the Templars in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_in_excelso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vox in excelso</a>
 (A voice from on high), dated 22 March 1312. This bull was approved by 
the Council on 3 April 1312 and the Pope announced a future crusade.</span></p>

<h2><span id="The_322_Brotherhood_of_Death_numerical_signature_fore_er_etched_into_the_design_of_the_World_Trade_Center">The 322 Brotherhood of Death numerical signature fore er etched into the design of the World Trade Center</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Given the brazen nature of the 9/11 
domestic terrorist attacks, it should not come as a surprise to anyone 
that whoever was responsible for perpetuating the attacks would have 
announced their intention to destroy these buildings ahead of time. The 
progeny of Jove numerically sign their work. They’ve been doing so for 
millennia. The compulsion to respect this deeply ingrained tradition 
that connects them to one another across a vast ocean of time 
(especially on something as historically significant as the destruction 
of the World Trade Center) is so so strong that I have come to 
characterize it as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>their single greatest weakness</em></strong></span>.
 Knowing this is key to understanding them and makes it possible to 
track their movements throughout all of recorded history. Counting the 
rooftops, the seven buildings of the World Trade Center were comprised 
of 322 floors. This is the “real horror” to which I am referring in the 
title of this page. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I don’t think they ever expected anyone to notice this. </em></strong></span>But it doesn’t stop there. <em>This numerical signature encodes the year of the apocalypse.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="impact-72">Were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WHEN </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT </span>of the apocalypse designed into The World Trade Center?</div>

<p>Numerical signatures are of such importance to understanding the world in which we live that I recently created page <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/signatures/">№ 73. The Immense Importance of Dates and Numerical Signatures</a></em> so that I could begin collecting all of them into one place.</p>

<p>The indirect reference to Pythagoras suggests grouping buildings 
three, four, and five together as in a 3-4-5 right triangle (the 
smallest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pythagorean triple</a>).
 However, here I must say that I did so quite naturally and long before 
becoming aware of the significance of the year 222 in the Roman 
calendar.</p>

<div class="intro">The stamp of death</div>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And here is the 43.</em></strong></span>
 Can you not see that this is deliberate? I cannot be imagining all of 
this. It’s real. It’s in your face. Long before the first blueprints 
were ever produced, David Rockefeller and the other bankers predestined 
this building to be destroyed on September 11, 2001. The amount of 
planning that went into this easily exceeds that of the Georgia 
Guidestones. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Hence, I have come to regard the destruction of the World Trade Center as what I call an end-time marker.</em></strong></span>
 Not even the bankers would do something like this unless the end was 
starring us in the face. They are just making everyone else in the know 
aware of the advanced weaponry at their disposal should anyone be 
contemplating throwing a monkey wrench into their plans. That everyone 
else would most certainly include the Russians, Chinese, and the 
Jesuits.</p>

<p>The 23 has been separated out to symbolically represent the coming

was split between buildings four and five to satisfy the need for the 
3-4-5 Pythagoras triangle. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 28px;">The nine is always a reference to command 
and control. In this context, it symbolically represents the bankers. 
The number 13 as always is a reference to the Ophiuchus constellation 
which includes the Galactic Center, and the 48 levels of building seven 
are a reference to Ptolemy’s 48 classical constellations which includes 
Ophiuchus.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="impact-54">And of course, the 47 stories of Building 7 
(without the roof) is always a reference to Mars, the god of war. This 
and the fact that it was clad in <span style="color: #ff0000;">red granite</span>
 is making an unmistakable statement. The month of March (as in March 22
 or 322) was named after Mars, and outcroppings of the Pikes Peak 
granite in Colorado are red.</div>

 This confirms who was behind the September 11, 2001, symbolic 
destruction of the World Trade Center beyond any shadow of a doubt. If 
you think it unimaginably cruel to send so many people to their deaths 
to make such a statement, you lack the perspective of the progeny of 
Jove. We are all the walking dead to them. The World Trade Center was 
designed and built to be destroyed and in the process, the progeny of 
Jove showed their hand. As thoroughly documented on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7.

old. He graduated from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in 1936 and got 
his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940. According
 to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/business/david-rockefeller-dead-chase-manhattan-banker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a>
 article, “That same year he married Margaret McGrath, known as Peggy, 
whom he had met at a dance seven years earlier, when he was a Harvard 
freshman…” <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>So, until 1940 he is nothing more than a college student and newlywed.</em></strong></span> The following section from Wikipedia shows that his experience in government at the time is little more than an unpaid intern.</p>

<div class="intro">Why?</div>
<p>You must ponder this question because it is of profound importance 
for your understanding of what is happening in the world right now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Why was this young man announcing the World Trade Center in 1943?</em></strong></span>
 The answer to this question is simply that this is an example of 
multigenerational planning. David Rockefeller can be removed from the 
equation. This is obviously the work of his father John D. Rockefeller, 
who is merely taking attention off of himself. The real question is,</p>

<div class="intro">My prayer</div>
<p>And so I pray for the right words, to get you and me past this sense 
of Internet surfing or me trying to entertain and increase my traffic, 
beyond all these frivolities to the same somber state of mind that keeps
 me at work on this website despite the hardships and countless hours of
 toil. Yes, of course, it would be gratifying if there were more readers
 and more donations, but that is not what drives me. That is not what 
makes me continue this research even when I realize hardly anyone is 
really listening to me, that I am speaking to an empty auditorium. I 
just ripped away months of work about Sir Francis Bacon and Elizabethan 
England from this homepage and moved most of it to page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/">№ 53. SN 1604, Sir Francis Bacon, and the origins of the Rosicrucians</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I did so specifically because of this discovery that the World Trade Center was announced in 1943.</em></strong></span>
 I did so in an effort to create a framework for explaining the 
significance of David Rockefeller announcing the World Trade Center <em>two decades in advance of any work being done even in the planning stages</em>. For details about the planning, see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/newyork-world-trade-center-1942-2002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>World Trade Center (1942-2002)</em></a> on PBS.org. The Japanese architect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoru_Yamasaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minoru Yamasaki</a>, who was responsible for the final design, has an article entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://architectuul.com/architecture/world-trade-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>World Trade Center</em></a>
 on Architectuul.com which is worth mentioning in this context. He also 
says, “The idea of establishing a World Trade Center in New York City 
was first proposed in 1943.”</p>

<div class="intro">“A journey that begins where everything ends…”</div>
<p>But even that pales in significance when you realize that the Ћinkers responded by releasing <em>The Black Hole</em> movie in 1979, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>43 years before the winter solstice in 2022</em></strong></span>. The author David Montaigne to whom I dedicated page&nbsp;<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a></em>
 was the first to notice this. In the end, this second reference to the 
year 2022 may be the single most important thing we can learn from the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie because,—in the context of the “course correction” in <em>The Black Hole</em>,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>it suggests very strongly that the Earth crustal displacement is expected in 2022</em></strong></span>.
 Everything and everyone who matters is screaming that we are at the 
threshold of something that is going to erase the world in which you 
live in a single day. I can give you the facts, but I cannot make you 
understand the significance of all of this. Internalizing the reality 
that we are the last generation is individual. No one can make you see 
this. In some very real sense, it is between you and God or whatever 
name you want to give to consciousness.</p>

<p>Though not yet written, on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 28. A date with destiny: The year of the apocalypse</a>, the very first subsection under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#2022">2022</a> is all about the five-year “course correction” at the start of <em>The Black Hole</em> movie which is indirectly referenced in a&nbsp;scene from <em>Tomorrowland</em> inside a collectibles store named <em>Blast from the Past</em>. The five-year “course correction” is&nbsp;from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">September 23, 2017</a>,
 to the year 2022. This is the last effort of the Ћinkers to warn the 
people about the coming Earth crustal displacement. What does it mean 
that <em>The Black Hole</em> was released exactly 43 years before the 
winter solstice on December 21, 2022? And does this mean the world is 
going to end on that date? No! <em>Let us not make that mistake again.</em> The world is not ready for another December 21, 2012. I believe <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the
 date December 21 is just piggybacking December 21, 2012, as a way of 
symbolically affirming that this is the year of the apocalypse</em>.</strong></span>&nbsp;The following video is the first highly symbolic 58 seconds of the <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 movie, which is precisely how long it takes for the main character to 
come into focus. This 58 seconds is of course a nod to Queen Elizabeth I
 as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/">№ 53. SN 1604, Sir Francis Bacon, and the origins of the Rosicrucians</a>. You can stop and start this video at will to demonstrate that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>there is no Tomorrowland until after the first 43 seconds</em></span></strong>. That is to say, <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 exists only in the next world, after the coming apocalypse. Timing is 
everything in this movie, perhaps none more than these first 43 seconds.</p>

<p>An astute observer will also notice that <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">WALT DISNEY PICTURES <small>PRESENTS</small></span>
 appears at the 32-33 second transition. This is the Freemasons of the 
South reminding you who made the movie, as if anyone in the know had to 
be told. None of this stuff is by chance, and if you are inclined to 
think otherwise, it is simply because you have not learned how to 
interpret movie symbolism in which runtimes are critical.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The greater context</div>
<p>You need to read and study page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/">№ 53. SN 1604, Sir Francis Bacon, and the origins of the Rosicrucians</a>
 (and by extension the Freemasons) in order to put what I just said into
 context. You should learn more about what happened in Elizabethan 
England than I know because I do not have the luxury of reading this 
website. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> and <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 are the culmination of 400 years of work to warn the people about the 
coming apocalypse. What so many of you do not know and what I fear you 
will not take the time to learn is that this effort was begun by the man
 you know of as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>His real name was Sir Francis Bacon.</em></strong></span>
 These are good men. I didn’t know what to think about them when I 
started writing and confused them with the European Illuminati (i.e. the
 bankers). <em>I labored under the misconception that all of the secret societies were essentially the same.</em> Nothing could be further from the truth. I have learned to respect the bankers because <em>like it or not</em>
 they are our best hope now. But my respect for the original 
Roscicrusians and the Freemasons of the South deepens the more I learn 
to the point that I am now fond of saying <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Sir Francis Bacon had a measure of the Christ in him</em></strong></span>. There is no more special period in all of history than what happened in Elizabethan England. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is sacred ground.</em></strong></span>
 You may not know this, and you may never take the time to learn that 
what I am saying is the truth; however, you may be acquainted with the 
butchery of the so-called Civil War.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly 2% of the population,&nbsp;<strong>an estimated 620,000 men</strong>,

<hr><p class="section-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION STATUS</strong></span>: Added September 9, 2021. Finished.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: September 17, 2021</p>
<p>Ever since the World Trade Center was announced by a young David 
Rockefeller back in 1943, those buildings were destined to be destroyed 
on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>September 11, 2001</em></strong></span>.
 Why is this date so special? What does it mean to the bankers? It has 
taken me years to arrive at this answer. This date has two parts: the 
day of the year <em>September 11</em> and the year <em>2001</em>. I will address the year in the next section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#What_do_the_1964_Worlds_Fair_223_Remington_rifle_cartridges_and_911_have_in_common"><em>What do the 1964 World’s Fair, .223 Remington rifle cartridges, and “9/11” have in common?</em></a>. In this section I only discuss September 11 or 911. The year is discussed in the next section.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight" style="font-size: 43px;">
<p>Before continuing, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>you must understand that</strong> The Revelation was written for the Roman elite</em></span>, the predecessors of the bankers. I cannot overemphasize this. You must read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>.
 Both of these books were commissioned by and for the progeny of Jove. 
One was written by Jews. The other was written by predecessors of the 
people I call the <em>Ћinkers (i.e. Christians)</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>and very well may be what gave birth to them</strong></em></span>. <em>The Revelation</em> caries in it serious misdirection intended for the Christians of this era, <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but it also includes some our earliest warnings from fellow Christians that something is afoot.</span> </strong></em></p>

<div class="intro">September 11</div>
<p>But why September 11? Why this particular date? If you knew what I 
did about the progeny of Jove, you would know this date must be somehow 
profoundly important. Or so I thought. <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was so focused on the date, I overlooked the number.</span></em></strong> All that changed when I watched this video about the Hoover Dam (which was originally called the <em>Boulder</em> dam).</p>

 This is six years before David Rockefeller announces the World Trade 
Center to an unsuspecting world in 1943. For me at least, this pushes 
back Ћinker knowledge of September 11, 2001 to well before July 7, 1930 
when construction of the dam began as they clearly had a role in its 
design. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This film is unquestionably intended to convey something of immense importance.</em></strong></span>
 The 37 in 1937, by the way, is the complementary angle of 53 in a 3-4-5
 Pythagoras triangle, and the number 53 is always a reference to Sir 
Francis Bacon who started the original Rosicrucian and Freemason secret 
societies so that ours,—the last generation,—would be made aware of what
 is happening.</p>
<p>I was captivated by all of the highly symbolic numbers in this short film such as the date June 6, 19<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>33</strong></span>. Of course, June 6 is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">66</span></strong>, the same as D-Day in WWII. This was the date on which the very first concrete was poured.</p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>It was on June 6, 1933, that the first bucket of concrete was placed 
in the very lowest of the dam forms, 135 feet below the level where a 
few months previously had flowed the unchallenged Colorado river.</p>

<p>The dam is also <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>66</strong></span>0 feet thick at the base. Towards the end of the film we hear, “The roadway traversing its <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>13</strong></span>00
 foot crest forms a magnificent link in a transcontinental highway.” But
 what really caused me to sit up and pay attention was a few sentences 
later when we hear “with a shoreline of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span>0
 miles.” You will read about the significance of the number 55 below. It
 is a numerical signature of the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>At this point I was transfixed.</em></strong></span>
 Comparatively speaking, this is “in your face” use of highly symbolic 
numbers. That level of obviousness is in and of itself unusual for the 
Ћinkers, who I am now certain are behind the making of this film.</p>

<p>But the dam height of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">730</span></strong>
 feet is what initially caught my attention while first watching the 
film. You might say, “Well that’s just how high the canyon was,” but 
they dug down 135 feet below the river bed and removed “two million tons
 of rock, earth, and sand.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day by day, week after week, the top workings of the structure 
approached its full height of 730 feet, far above the crest of any other
 dam yet built by man or likely to be built for years to come</p>

<div style="height:13px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="impact-72">730 feet is the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>exact</strong></span> depth of the White Ash Mine disaster on September 9, 1889, exactly 132 years ago as of this writing.</div>
<p>(I note in passing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover_Dam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> currently lists the height of the Hoover dam as 726.4 feet.)</p>
<p>If you read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/#The_White_Ash_Mine_disaster"><em>The White Ash Mine disaster</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">№ 58. The multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith</a>,
 you will realize that for the longest time I thought the September 11, 
2001 date had something to do with this mining disaster, a major setback
 in the construction of what is now a multi-trillion-dollar tunnel 
system in Colorado. I tried for many months to make that work, but 
eventually abandoned the idea and had all but given up on ever 
discovering why the progeny of Jove chose the date September 11, 2001 to
 destroy the World Trade Center. I can assure you though, the Freemasons
 to this very day mourn the death of those men and I am as certain as I 
am the air I breath that the height of this dam is in memory of them. 
The White Ash Mine disaster was a major setback for their plans to 
survive the coming Earth crustal displacement at a time when they were 
just getting started in Colorado.</p>
<p>It became apparent to me that besides being the largest of its kind in the world when it was built, <em>this dam was highly symbolic</em>. It is providing electricity to Los Angeles where films such as <em>Back to the Future</em> will be filmed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">age old conflict</a>
 between the bankers and the Ћinkers. That makes the electricity 
produced at this dam something of a weapon. And it was at the end of the
 film when it started discussing electrical production that things took 
an unexpected turn involving more highly symbolic numbers, <em>but those associated with the bankers</em>.
 “Perched on shelves hewn into the canyon walls, [the four intake 
towers] tower 403 feet to an elevation above the crest of the dam and 
the rim of the canyon.” You will see this number again. It s widely 
reported that 403 is the exact number of first responders who died on 
September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>In light of everything else, this was a painfully obvious reference to the banker number <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>43</strong></span>
 discussed on this homepage. Now you may be inclined to think turning 
403 into 43 is a stretch. I might even agree if it were not for two 
things. 403 feet is a very specific number, and every bone in my body 
tells me it is deliberate. But now listen to what happens next, because 
this is what caused me to jump out of bed.</p>
<div class="intro">Unexpected reference to 9/11</div>
<p class="first-paragraph">At 32:09 minutes, we hear, “The first generator was placed in operation on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>September 11</em></strong></span>, 1936.” <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This could only mean one thing.</em></strong></span></p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">September 11 is not a date.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">It’s a number.</span></div>
<p>But what does the number 911 mean? It did not take long to figure out
 the answer to this question, but if you are new to my work, you really 
do need to read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>. The bankers wrote <em>The Revelation</em>. Understanding this is central to much of my work.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">September 11 is a reference to<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Revelation 9:11</span></div>

<p>As noted in the text of this verse, <em>Apollyon</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Abaddon. It is widely reported as the <em>present participle</em> of the Greek verb <em>apolluo</em>, “to destroy.”</p>

<p>This is the only occurrence of the word <em>Apollyon</em> in the Bible. That is what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>hapax legomenon</em></a> means. It is Greek for “being said once,” a word that occurs only once, in this case in the scriptures—<em>the Old and New Testaments as well as the Apocrypha</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Only once.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Here is Revelation 9:11 in the original 1611 King James Version of the Bible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This same “A destroyer” marginal note is present in the Latin Vulgate as “in Latin <i>Exterminans,</i>” <i>exterminans</i>
 being the Latin word for “destroyer.” Still, I find it interesting that
 the Ћinkers chose to preserve this note in their translation of <em>The Revelation</em>.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Death and destruction</div>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible, Abaddon occurs six times but is translated as <em>destruction</em>.
 So once again, the English word “Abaddon” occurs only once in the 
Bible. This is very significant in explaining why September 11 was 
chosen as the date on which the bankers would unleash their death and 
destruction on the world. The uniqueness of this verse,—and it message 
of death and destruction,—has been carefully preserved for almost two 
millennia now.</p>
<p>Here one must recall that although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> states, <em>“During
 the September 11 attacks in 2001, 2,977 people were killed, 19 
hijackers committed murder–suicide, and more than 6,000 others were 
injured. The immediate deaths included 265 on the four planes, 2,606 in 
the World Trade Center and in the surrounding area, and 125 at the 
Pentagon</em>,” for the past 20 years countless millions of men, women, 
and children were killed and maimed in the Middle East and the 
infrastructure of entire countries were destroyed, including Iraq which 
is the very same Babylon referred to in Revelation 18. Another 
self-fulfilling prophesy written and executed by the bankers? The terms <em>false flag attack</em> or <em>domestic terrorism</em>
 do not do justice to what has happened over the past 20 years. Some of 
the finest men in this country were sent to their deaths. Others are 
maimed for life. And what we have left behind can only be described as <em>death and destruction</em>. This is the very meaning of Abaddon in Hebrew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>II. Old Testament Background.<br>1. Fundamental Meaning:<br>The term 
Abaddon (“destruction”) appears solely in the Wisdom literature of the 
Old Testament and in the following narrow range of instances: Job 26:6; 
28:22; 31:12; Ps 88:11; Pr 15:11. In all these passages save one (Job 
31:12) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the word is combined either with Sheol, “death,” or “the grave,” in such a way as to indicate a purely eschatological term</em></strong></span>…</p>
<p class="citation">International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.internationalstandardbible.com/A/apollyon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Apollyon</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is madness, and it is a madness brought about by the sure knowledge that the entire world is about to be destroyed. </em></strong></span>Why did we go to the Middle East?&nbsp; I suspect the answer is much simpler than most people can accept. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/war/">War is a pastime for the bankers.</a>
 It enriches their coffers, depopulates the world, and gives them 
something to do while they wait for the inevitable destruction of the 
entire world. I think they went to the Iraq just to pillage it museums 
and collect artifacts to preserve for their children in new world to 
come.</p>
<p>This “king” in Revelation 9:11 <strong><em>is</em></strong> the bankers. <em>We are the walking dead to them.</em> The “king” is not an individual. Satan is Saturn. As is the case with almost all apparently <em>evil</em> symbolism, the concept of a devil or Satan is rooted in out planet’s catastrophic past. <em>There is no “pure evil” about to be unleashed on the world because there are not two powers in eternity.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Logically speaking, there cannot be.</em></strong></span> Sooner or later one would succumb to the other. That is why I characterize the belief in a devil as essentially <em>not monotheistic</em>. God, the fabric of the universe, is omnipotent. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>To believe otherwise is to have more than one god</em></strong></span>, and right now this describes the overwhelming majority of so-called “Christians” in the world. <em>The bankers know this, which is why they want to put an end to this religious insanity.</em> The world will be better off without religion, without the buildings that make involuntary hypocrites of us all. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I am in sympathy with the bankers on this point.</em></strong></span> Live your religion.

<div class="intro">What fools are we?</div>
<p>The 911 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Emergency_telephone_number_911">emergency telephone number</a> in number in <em>The Untied States of America</em> is a classic case of <em>predictive programming</em>. When I step back and think of the February 1967 “The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society” report discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/implosion/#The_Police_State_militarization_of_the_police"><em>The Police State (militarization of the police)</em></a>—
which is what gave birth to the 911 national emergency telephone 
number,—I am in awe of the level of mind control the bankers exercise 
over the general population. Mind-boggling, multigeneral planning is all
 it took for us to fall into line and start referring to the gruesome 
murder of thousands of people in the United States and countless 
millions in Iraq and Iran as if it were some kind of an old fashion 
advertising jingle.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">Before there was Revelation 9:11, there were 
prime numbers. And symbolism at this level is always going to be about 
numbers because numbers are the religion of the progeny of Jove. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>What
 I am saying is that the destruction of the World Trade Center was not 
on September 11, 2001 because of Revelation 9:11, but rather Revelation 
9:11 and the events of September 11, 2001 are based on prime numbers.</strong></em></span>
 It would be difficult for me to fully explain the importance of primes 
numbers to the progeny of Jove. But I will say this. When during my 
studies a number first catches my attention, the first thing I do is 
check to see if it is prime. 911 is prime. The second thing I do is to 
check what prime number it is in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of prime numbers</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is the 156<sup>th</sup> prime number. </em></strong></span>This
 alone may be why September 11 was chosen in the first place. Please 
note that John Donne was a contemporary of Sir Francis Bacon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 53px;">For Whom the Bell Tolls</span><br>by<br>John Donne</p>
<div style="margin-left: 432px; font-size: 43px;">
<p>No man is an island,<br>Entire of itself.<br>Each is a piece of the continent,<br>A part of the main.<br>If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>Europe is the less.<br>As well as if a promontory were.<br>As well as if a manor of thine own<br>Or of thine friend’s were.<br>Each man’s death diminishes me,<br>For I am involved in mankind.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Therefore, send not to know</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>For whom the bell tolls,</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It tolls for thee.</em></strong></span></p>
</div>


<div style="height:54px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p>The old mantle clock in my maternal grandparents home would chime the hour of the day every hour on the hour. Do the math.</p>


<div style="height:27px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p class="typewriter" style="text-align: center; font-size: 43px;">(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12) x 2 = 156</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p>So you see, by using the 156<sup>th</sup> prime number, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>he progeny of Jove are invoking the passage of time</em></strong></span>. That’s all these people do; they prepare for the coming Earth crustal displacement. What we mere mortals consider to be <em>life</em>, is nothing more for them than <em>the passage of time</em> awaiting what they know to be the inevitable destruction of this world. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>There is no way in hell this is mere coincidence.</strong> </em></span>So I say again, the decision to use 911 probably began with the fact that it is the 156<sup>th</sup> prime.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13</div>
<p>Those are the first six prime numbers. You see, <em>“I am No. 5, the Third Prime in Life.” </em>We don’t say <em>“nine hundred and eleven” </em> when talking about September 11, 2001, we say <em>“nine eleven.”</em> The number 9 is the most sacred number of all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/gods/">sacred numbers</a>
 because all of the other sacred numbers are a multiple of nine. For the
 uninitiated, what I just said will be of no consequence, but such are 
destined to die in the coming Earth crustal displacement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is why nine is always used to signify command and control.</em></strong></span> And now I am going to explain to you even more precisely why the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">11 is the last prime number<br><span class="impact-216-red">before 13</span></div>
<p>And 13 is the number of the end time. It always has been. I discuss this at length on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/galactic-center/">№ 29. Number 13, Ophiuchus, the Galactic Center, active Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic Superwaves</a>. That is why there were 13 colonies. That is why 13 is plastered all over the one dollar bill. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is one thing</em></strong></span>, and long before <em>The Revelation</em>
 was ever written, 911 was destined to be the verse in which the bankers
 would begin their march towards what happened twenty years ago on 
September 11, 2001. I don’t really give a damn what you think, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>but I will assure you this is what 911 is all about</em></strong></span>,
—prime numbers and the coming Earth crustal displacement. Once you enter
 into this world of sacred numbers, it really is “a small world after 
all.” There’s nothing complicated. Nothing difficult to understand.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Conclusions</div>
<p>The big picture here is that the bankers are alluding to <em>The Revelation</em> and the passage of time and therefore to the apocalypse or end of this world. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What happened on September 11, 2001 when properly understood is one of the biggest signs that we are “at the door.”</em></strong></span>
 And that is all you really need to know about 911. It a doomsday 
message from the bankers. It was them shouting out “Finally, the time 
has come and we no longer need to concern ourselves about what the 
walking dead think. The world is ours now to do with as we please. For 
in a short time, in the blink of an eye, all of this shall be gone, and 
we will tell our children bedtime stories about how the land on which 
they live was once called <em>The United States of America</em>.” And 
they will explain to their children how primitive a people we were, how 
we believed in ghosts and goblins (religion), and how gullible, stupid, 
and easily manipulated we were. And that will be the end of us. 
“Tomorrow is just a dream away.”</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">Let me give you a hint. If you fancy yourself
 a student of the end time and are not aware of the role Sir Francis 
Bacon plays in all of this as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>,
 I would liken you to clown who overslept, was given the wrong address 
by someone who really doesn’t like him, and shows up at a funeral in a 
Yellow cab, only to have it drive away before he realizes something is 
wrong. Standing there in the middle of the street and drawing unwanted 
attention from the distracted mourners, he begins to question everything
 about his life and where he went wrong. But don’t worry, I know how you
 feel. I’ve been at this for years, and I never did the math on 1964 and
 2022 until the date on which this section was added.</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">Here are two simple addition statements that have had an enormous impact on your life whether you know it or not.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1943 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2001</div>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1964 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2022</div>

<p>So did you get the hint? If <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is one thing</em></strong></span>
 has any meaning other than the coming Earth crustal displacement, it’s 
Sir Francis Bacon’s mother, Queen Elizabeth I, who ascended to the 
throne in 1558. And if you’re late to this party, let me tell you, 
William Shakespeare (the playwright, not the actor) was Sir Francis 
Bacon. Thanks to the work of an obscure Norwegian organist by the name 
of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/#Petter_Amundsen_and_the_meaning_of_numbers_53_and_106">Petter Amundsen</a>,
 the identity of William Shakespeare is no longer an open question. But 
the Norwegians should temper their pride because Petter Amundsen traded 
it all for the pursuit of riches. It is a sad tale that caused me to 
create the unfinished page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/">№ 50. Shakespeare’s last play: Oak Island (a tragedy)</a>.
 But I hold Petter Amundsen in high regard if for no other reason than 
Wikipedia, a fully owned subsidiary of the bankers, does not have an 
article about him to this very day. That puts him in the company of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Dr_Judy_Wood">Dr. Judy Wood</a> as people the bankers consider so threatening in the end time that <em>they are blatantly suppressing knowledge of them</em>.</p>

<div class="intro">A brief rant</div>
<p>Before I continue, allow me a brief rant on this most special of 
days. If you call yourself a Christian Scientist and yet are unaware of 
the fact that this is <em>precisely</em> why Mary Baker Eddy began her chapter entitled <em>The Apocalypse</em> on page 558 of <em>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures</em>, you need to stop “malpracticing” me and read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sixth-seal/">№ 33. Mary Baker Eddy and the end-time</a>. Mrs. Eddy’s warning about the year 2022 was perhaps <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the most eloquent and sophisticated warning of them all</em></strong></span>. I have more respect for what the bankers are doing in Colorado than I do for the current generation of Christian Scientists. <em>The movement is dead</em>
 and I have stood alone “a voice crying in the wilderness” to more 
“Journal-listed” (read official sanctioned) practitioners and teachers 
than I can recall at present. And they have to a man or woman <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>steadfastly refused to read that page</em></strong></span>.
 I thought when I experienced the meaning of “Let not then your good be 
evil spoken of” (Romans 14:16) after 13 years of caring for my elderly 
Christian Science teaacher, I knew all there was to know about this 
wretched movement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I was wrong. </em></strong></span>Religion sucks.</p>

<p>Denver, Colorado was founded (or “platted”) on November 22, 1858. 
Nothing this critical in the history of Denver, Colorado was left to 
chance. The ground breaking ceremony for the Denver International 
Airport was held on November 22, 1989. This date clearly means 
something. But what? As we have seen, 322 and 43 are banker numbers that
 date back to March 22 and April 3, 1312. November 22 is an obvious 
reference to the <em>Pastoralis praeeminentiae</em> (Latin for “Pastoral
 Preeminence”) papal bull issued on November 22, 1307. This was the 
first papal bull issue by Pope Clement V following the arrests of the 
Knights Templar in France at dawn on October 13, 1307. The papal bull 
ordered the arrest of Knights Templar and the confiscation of their 
property throughout Christendom.</p>
<p>But on November 22, 1858, Denver Colorado is clearly still under the 
control of the Ћinkers, which is to say, the Freemasons of the South. 
The Civil War does not even start for another three and a half years. So
 why do they found the city on a day of the year that is closely 
associated with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">long-time foe</a>?
 This question intrigues me. What were they thinking? What was their 
reason for doing this? It sort of reminds me of the actual end date of 
the Maya Long Count on December 16, 2013, five days before the winter 
solstice in that 1307 is five years before 1312 (from which the bankers 
322 and 43 are derived). In other words, for those of you who follow my 
work closely, this is kind of a <em>The Black Hole</em> “course correction” moment in which the Ћinkers are trying to tell us September 23, 2017,—the day of the <em>great wonder</em> discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>,
—is five years earlier than the actual year of the apocalypse. Another 
thing that grabs my attention is that Sir Francis Bacon was born on 
January 22, 1561. So while 1122 points to the bankers, it incorporates 
the 122 birthday of the man who founded the original Rosicrucians and by
 extension, the Freemasons. But from where I stand as of this writing, 
it’s hard to tell what they were thinking.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">A shared identity</div>
<p>What we do know for sure is that 58 is a reference to Queen Elizabeth
 I. This cannot be overemphasized. The next section discusses what I am 
calling the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings that ends in 2015. 
As you will read in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#2015">2015</a>
 section below, even the choice of the year 2015 is in memory of Sir 
Francis Bacon’s mother. But after the Civil War in which the Freemasons 
of the South lost control of the country to the Old World bankers (who 
at the time were posing as the European Illuminati), <em>the bankers own Denver, Colorado</em>. Control of the Pikes Peak batholith discussed in detail on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">№ 58. The multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith</a> is the “prize” for which every one was fighting. This explains 1943 + <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>58</strong></span> = 2001, the choice of the year in which to destroy the World Trade Center. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The bankers are not paying homage to Queen Elizabeth I</em></strong>.</span> They are identifying themselves <em>then</em> and <em>now</em>. The <em>then</em> is their start in life as the Knights Templar and the <em>now</em> is their present home in Denver, Colorado. So the shared identity is 1858, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the year Denver, Colorado was founded</em></strong></span>.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The 1964 World’s Fair</div>
<p>This homepage offers what I consider to be a remarkable proof that my
 start and end dates of December 21, 1979 to September 30, 2015 (13, 607
 days) f<em>or the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings</em> are exact, the implications of which are nothing short of profound. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But 1964 predates the beginning of this period.</em> </strong></span>Why? This is because the 1964 World’s Fare discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/#Why_is_Tomorrowland_all_about_the_1964_New_York_Worlds_Fair"><em>Why is Tomorrowland all about the 1964 New York World’s Fair?</em></a> section on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">№ 22. Tomorrowland cometh</a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>serves as the foundation for the “fireworks finale.”</em></strong></span> It uses the number 58 to point right to 2022.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1964 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2022</div>
<p>And what was the main symbol of the 1964 World’s Fair, which was used to announce the coming Earth crustal displacement? <em>Why the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisphere#Symbolism_and_media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unisphere</a> of course.</em>
 That being the case, you would expect the Ћinkers to be using some 
highly symbolic numbers in the design of the “world’s largest globe.”</p>

<div class="intro">.223 Remington</div>
<p>I normally characterize the bankers as being oblivious to what the 
Ћinkers are doing, not because they are stupid, but rather because they 
are just too busy preparing for the coming Earth crustal displacement. 
But this 2022 – 1964 = 58 equation is rather in your face, and the 
bankers had a few years to figure it out. How did they respond? 1964 was
 the year they started producing the .223 Remington cartridge used in 
the M16 rifle carried by U.S. soldiers ever since.</p>
<div class="impact-72-red" style="text-align: center;">.223 Remington: ammo of the end time.</div>
<p>Failing to fully understand and appreciate the significance of numbers to the progeny of Jove, <em>particularly the number 322 to the bankers</em>,
 you will overlook subtle clues that we are living in the end time. Ever
 since the year of the 1964 World’s Fair which was so critical to the 
making of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://tomorrowland/" target="_blank"><em>Tomorrowland</em></a>
 movie (the last end-time warning for the masses), from Vietnam to 
Dessert Storm and Afghanistan, countless millions of people have been 
killed or maimed by a bullet so carelessly named that it rivals the 
Apollo program as a sure sign that we are the last generation before the
 end, unless of course you think developing a rifle cartridge that just 
so happened to have a caliber (caliber is actually the groove diameter 
of the bore) that is 322 backwards was mere coincidence. The naming of 
this ammunition is what I can only describe as <em>reckless abandon</em>, no different than the Apollo program itself. The bankers know we are close to the end, and they are acting accordingly. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>They
 have killed countless millions of Vietnamese, Iraqi, and Afghanistan 
men, women, and children with a bullet that carried their signature as 
surely did the World Trade Center before it was destroyed.</em></span></strong>
 And if they were this careless in the decades leading up to the end, 
what might we expect in the coming months? These are perilous times.</p>

<p>Conspicuously absent is the destruction of the World Trade Center on 
September 11, 2001. You can read about that on this homepage and page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</a>.
 But do not for a moment think what happened on that fateful day is any 
different than the Georgia Guidestones, the “Apocalyptic Pillar” at the 
Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, or the <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em>
 movies. All three of these at least in part are intended to inform us 
that the bankers,—the people who control the end-time infrastructure in 
and around Denver, Colorado—are responsible for what happened on 
September 11, 2001. In other words, three of the five end-time warnings 
from the Ћinkers are at least in part telling us what really happened 
that day. Why is this so important to them? What does it say about 9/11?</p>

 You must divorce yourself from popular thinking about what happened on 
that day, be it the official version of events or one of an endless 
variety of “conspiracy theories” about what really happened on 9/11. And
 you must stop playing the blame game. Who did it is painfully obvious 
once you learn how to read the numeric symbolism, but that is not the 
point. <em>Listen to me, please.</em> You must think of 9/11 
dispassionately in order to grasp what the Ћinkers are trying to tell 
us. And that can be summarized by saying <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>men do not do things of such magnitude unless they know the world in which we live is about to be destroyed</em></strong></span>.
 It is the timing of 9/11 that should concern you more than anything 
else. We are living in the end time. It’s really happening. That is the 
message of 9/11 and that is why three of the five end-time warnings from
 the Ћinkers point to the bankers as the ones responsible for 9/11. It’s
 not to blame them. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is for us to comprehend the enormity of what is happening. </em></strong></span>Why else do you think 9/11 dominates the homepage of <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>? When I first started writing, 9/11 was just one of the pages in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/sitemap/#h-our-entirely-fabricated-reality"><em>Our Entirely Fabricated Reality</em></a>
 menu intended to challenge the reader to accept alternative 
explanations for major historical events, nothing more. Now it is more 
important to me than what happened in Elizabethan England. In other 
words, <em>I too had to learn the profound significance of what happened on September 11, 2001</em>. And I learned it from the Freemasons of the South over a period of years.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The list</div>
<p>This list is in more or less chronological order. In the following 
condensed list, there are only five end-time warnings. It is my strongly
 held belief that all five of these are the work of the Freemasons of 
the South. These are the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>. The 
first two are made of stone to honor the papal architects who built the 
Gothic cathedrals in Europe while keeping a close eye on the Roman 
Catholic Church. The last three are all movies. Of these six movies, the
 most well-hidden from public scrutiny was <em>Virus</em> (1980). It 
carries the message the new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, 
China, in December 2019 (COVID-19) is an integral part of the end game. <em>Virus</em> (1980) is part of a trilogy of interconnected movies that are the backbone of this homepage.&nbsp;</p>

</ul><p>This may not seem like an impressive list to you, but each of 
these warnings has a huge story behind it. The level of planning here is
 intense. What I believe to be probably only a handful of Freemason 
families in the South—who were isolated and cut off from the progeny of 
Jove by the Civil War <em>but retained specific information about the end time—</em>are on a mission <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>very much in the here and now</em></strong></span>
 to awaken you from your uniformitarian dream of life (in which 
planetary catastrophes only happen in movies). They got their marching 
orders from the Bard. This is a veritable fireworks finale of end-times 
warnings from the Ћinkers. I begin the list here and then continue it in
 a timeline fashion until the end of this section.</p>

<p>This last entry is non-trivial. Alder Av Grunn is one of my most important intellectual contributors. He is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.triplenine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Triple Nines Society</a>
 guy. He runs computer algorithms against the King James Bible. I assume
 in doing so that he is using well-known encryption algorithms used by 
Sir Francis Bacon and his circle of friends. Whatever he has found has 
him frightened. He will not tell me because he knows whatever he tells 
me will be published. In our last email exchange, I asked him a very 
specific question about a number that is known to be of paramount 
importance to the progeny of Jove. His email response began, “Not yet. 
Time is not right.” He went on to say he would have to divulge more than
 he is willing to share at this time. I trust this guy. I know his real 
name and have confirmed his status in society. So I know the original 
1611 King James Bible encodes information way beyond the 222 occurrences
 of the word “wisdom” that I discuss in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#There_are_22_chapters_in_The_Revelation_and_222_occurrences_of_wisdom_in_the_KJV_of_the_Bible"><em>There are 22 chapters in The Revelation and 222 occurrences of “wisdom” in the KJV of the Bible</em></a>.
 But the year of publication somewhat confounds me.&nbsp;It is obvious 
why the King James Version of the Bible was commissioned in 1604, but I 
can never be sure why it was published in 2011. According to no less 
than Manly P. Hall,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first edition of the King James Bible, which was edited by 
Francis Bacon and prepared under Masonic supervision, bears more Mason’s
 marks than the Cathedral of Strasburg.</p>
<p class="citation">Manly P. Hall, <em>Rosicrucian and Masonic Origins</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Sir Francis Bacon was not fully cognizant of the exact date or 
year of the coming Earth crustal displacement, then none of the Ћinkers 
have ever known. That is simply not possible. <em>They knew.</em> But the meaning behind the 11 in 1611 or what they must have been keenly aware of—the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its publication in 2011—escapes me.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The 1617 edition</div>
<p>I don’t want to bore the reader with too many details about the KJV 
of the Bible, but there were “He” and “She” editions. The former had a 
number of errors that were corrected in the latter. The “She” edition 
was printed from 1611 to 1613. <em>And perhaps even more importantly there is a 1617 edition.</em> The latter is as rare as the original “He” edition printed in 1611. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.thekjvstore.com/1617-king-james-bible-original-bible-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The KJV Store</a>,
 “The 1617 edition is nearly identical to the 1611 edition, with 
differences only in some word spacing, spelling, and woodcuts — only an 
expert can distinguish the two editions! <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The leaves of the 1611 and 1617 editions were designed to be fully interchangeable.</em></strong></span>
 Census of current copies: 1611 “He” edition, 175 copies; 1611 “She” 
edition, 450 copies; 1617 edition, 225 copies” (emphasis added). Knowing
 what I do of the Ћinkers, here is my take on what is happening. We know
 how meticulously the First Folio was printed. There are no mistakes in 
it except those Sir Francis Bacon intended. <em>To have an actual, real mistake in the First Folio would have been disastrous.</em>
 There were 900 pages in the First Folio because as anyone who reads me 
knows, the number 9 and multiples thereof always signify command and 
control. However, there were 1536 pages in the 1611 KJV of the Bible. 
The reason for this page count is known by only a handful of people. It 
is a reference to the year that <em>Prognostictio Eximii Doctoris Theophrasti Paracelsi</em> or <em>The Prophecies of Paracelsus</em>
 was published,—the book that inspired Sir Francis Bacon and his circle 
of friends in Elizabethan England to found the original Roscicrucains 
and by extension the Freemasons. But the First Folio was printed in 
1623, twelve years after the King James Bible. <em>In other words, these men did not have the benefit of the experience of printing such a huge book in 1611.</em>
 I emphasized “The leaves of the 1611 and 1617 editions were designed to
 be fully interchangeable” in the above quote because I think it is the 
1617 edition for which the year of publication is meant to be of great 
significance. It would have been error-free by then, a reliable copy for
 my friend Alder Av Grunn to be running his computer algorithms against.
 And of course, this would make the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">September 23, 2017</a> date of the asterism alluded to in <em>The Revelation</em>
 the 400th anniversary of the publication of an (error-free) King James 
Version of the Bible. And in a world where deliberate errors are a means
 of communication, being free of actual, real printing errors is 
critically important.</p>

<p>I don’t think the year of publication is related to the Maya Long 
Count at all. Even if it were, there is the rather significant problem 
that Thompson did not propose the GMT (Goodman Martinez Thompson) 
Correlation until 1937. So the appearance of the KJV publication date 
being somehow related to the Maya Long Count is deceptive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">We live in a generation in which the Electric Universe school of thought, best represented in the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/thunderbolts/">David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill</a>, is daily rewriting almost all of the sciences while being completely ignored by academia and mainstream, <em>consensus science</em>. The world of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/no/">mathematically insane</a>
 is shrinking all the time and yet they continue to strut around as if 
nothing is happening. To be sure, December 21, 2012, was the greatest 
crying wolf incidence of all time. But those who took the ball and ran 
with it in traditional books and in a plethora of YouTube videos and 
Internet websites—all claiming to have divined the meaning of the Maya 
Long Count—were not attacked as they would be in today’s <em>political correctness</em> environment. They were not told what to think. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The most massive propaganda machine in the history of mankind lay dormant.</em></strong></span> Everyone was free to think for themselves about the meaning of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/maya-long-count/">Maya Long Count</a> and <em>what the public was being told</em>
 was the end date. Rather than being dismissed as a disrespectable 
subject, serious research was done into the meaning and history of the 
Maya Long Count.</p>
<div class="impact-90">Thus did the progeny of Jove throw <span style="color: #ff0000;">the apocalypse off-switch</span> in the popular imagination with the same ease one turns off an overhead light.</div>
<p>They did nothing more than idle their thought control machine. And then,—in the aftermath of December 21, 2012,—<em>they let the peanut gallery loose on the charlatans who found an audience amongst the unsuspecting public</em>.
 It worked. Trust me. No one alive knows how well it worked better than 
me. Everything changed on the morning of December 22, 2012.&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Henceforth, such nonsense would not be tolerated by the worldly-wise.</em></strong></span> What decent, law-abiding citizen would besmirch his own reputation by entertaining the thought <em>even for a moment</em> of a planetary catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in our lifetime? <em>Rubbish!!</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What nonsense.</em></strong></span> And yet, if you knew for sure that an Earth crustal displacement was imminent and billions of people were about to die, <em>is this not exactly what you would want the public to think?</em>&nbsp; Here I am reminded of what CIA Director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/casey/">William Casey</a>
 said to Ronald Reagan: “We’ll know our disinformation program is 
complete when everything the American public believes is false.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This list of end-time warnings is <em>clear evidence</em> that the 
Ћinkers are heavily invested in the year 2013. Why? I believe the answer
 to that question is the Maya Long Count. But before I say anything 
else, let me address the idea that the Maya Long Count is a calendar. It
 is not. The Maya Long Count was designed around its end date. It is 
best thought of as a <em>countdown clock</em>. It did not end on 
December 21, 2012, and the progeny of Jove know this. That was the end 
of 13 baktuns. A baktun represents one of three interlocking gears (or 
cogs) in the conceptual mechanism of the Maya Long Count, the one that 
corresponds to years. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It actually ended on December 16, 2013, after the two smaller gears that correspond to months and days came to a stop.</em></strong></span>
 This was hidden from us because, as discussed below, December 21, 2012 
was brilliantly designed to lull everyone alseep so that the real work 
of the end time could begin in earnest the following year. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is 13.</em></strong></span> Our one-dollar bill makes this perfectly clear.&nbsp;</p>

 need to wait a few more weeks or at most a month or so until I restore 
the sections on the cube. Suffice it to say for now that 2014,—the year 
that showed when the cube was installed,—was the 90<sup>th</sup> 
anniversary of the 1924 laying of the cornerstone for the Pythagoras 
Masonic Temple in Decatur, Georgia. These are the people who built the 
Georgia Guidestones. And as noted at the top of page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">№ 27. The grossly misunderstood Georgia Guidestones</a>, they also gave the Stone of Destiny to the bankers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2015 is the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the 
original Rosicrucians. We know this beyond any shadow of a doubt because
 the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. was completed in 1915, the 
300<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the original Rosicrucians as discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/#Construction_start_and_end_dates_for_the_House_of_the_Temple_in_Washington_DC"><em>Construction start and end dates for the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.</em></a>,
 only the 400th anniversary is very special. As the Israelites wandered 
in the wilderness for 40 years, 2015 marks the end of a 
multigenerational, sacred duty to warn the people about the coming Earth
 crustal displacement, one that originated with no less than <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor) whose real name was Sir Francis Bacon. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>There will be no more warnings after this year.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">The last numeric signature</div>
<p>The <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie was released <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>108</em></strong></span> days before Queen Elizabeth’s birthday. If you have read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and the founding of the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>, then I do not need to explain to you the significance of Queen Elizabeth I’s birthday. <em>The Walk</em> was released <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>23</em></strong></span> days after September 7, 2015. <em>I know there are no more end-time warnings from the Ћinkers because of the 23 days.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is Ћinker-talk for “It’s time for the show.”</em></strong></span> And it is a clear indication that nothing is to follow.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Farewell and godspeed</div>
<p><em>How can I say that?</em> I can understand a reluctance on the 
part of the reader to accept what I just said. I base this in large part
 on the profound elegance of the symbolism in <em>The Walk</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I shall never forget watching this movie for the first time.</em></strong></span>
 What others see is a simple tale of a tightrope walker performing a 
daring feat. But what I heard was the Ћinkers saying goodbye with such 
grace and beauty that it really did reduce me to tears. At several 
points, <em>sobbing</em> would be a more descriptive word. It felt like a dream at times. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>After that, I didn’t need anybody telling me we are on our own now.</em> </strong></span>It
 wasn’t until much later that I discovered this 
“last-of-the-end-time-warnings” numerical signature, but I knew right 
away what it meant. And I will take that certainty to the grave with me.
 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Walk was out last end-time warning.</em></strong></span> There will be no more.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">September 7</div>
<p>At precisely 13:00 in <em>Back to the Future Part III</em>, Doc says, “Just occurred to me Marty, since I end up in 1885 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>perhaps I am now in the history books</em></strong></span>.”
 A few moments later, the September 7 birthday of Queen Elizabeth I 
birthday is plaster all over the screen on Emmett Brown’s 
headstone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I named this scene from <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> the “history books” scene. The symbolism of the above still goes way beyond the reference to Queen Elizabeth I.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Constellations</div>
<p>The year Doc’s death is 1885 which is (2015 – 1885 =) 130 years. This
 is now the second reference to 13 in this scene. Because of the strong 
emphasis on destiny and Capricornus, whose name is called out repeatedly
 right before Doc’s grave is discovered, I would suggest to you that 
these hidden references to 13 are in fact references to the Ophiuchus 
constellation as discussed on page<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></span><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/galactic-center/">№ 29.&nbsp; Number 13, Ophiuchus, the Galactic Center, active Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic Superwaves</a></em><em>.</em>
 Look again at the still of Capricornus leaning against Doc’s 
gravestone. This is exactly how the constellation Capricornus leans 
against Aquarius. The significance of Capricornus is discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/progeny-of-jove/#Deliberately_provocative_astronomical_symbolism"><em>Deliberately provocative astronomical symbolism</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/progeny-of-jove/">№ 10. Who are the progeny of Jove?</a>.
 This whole scene is a reference to the Zodiac. Our destiny lies in the 
Aquarius and Capricornus constellations. The Babylonians called the 
Aquarius “the great one,” We are about to find out why.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">863 Survivors</div>
<p>I have learned to exercise extreme care when clipping scenes from 
these end-time warning movies because the scene runtimes also convey 
meaning. An example from below is the OUTATIME scene which I 
characterize as perhaps the most important scene in all of the end-time 
warning movies. It has a runtime of precisely 4:32, which not only is a 
sacred number but also happens to be the number of orbits of Jupiter in 
one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/great-cycles/">Maya Great Cycle</a>.&nbsp;Interestingly, this scene from <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> which depicts the final resting place of Doc has a runtime of precisely 1:50. This could be a reference to 2015. <em>But I note that there are 863 survivors in Virus (1980) and 863 is the 150<sup>th</sup> prime number.</em> Coincidence?</p>

<p>Again, I can understand how the casual reader might think so because 
he or she does not realize what is at stake here. We are talking about 
an Earth crustal displacement that is referred to as the <em>apocalypse</em> or <em>“day of the Lord”</em>
 in the Bible. It is going to erase everything and everyone you have 
ever known in one day. These end-time warning movies are the culmination
 of a 400-year effort to warn the people, one put into motion by no less
 than the man you know of as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor). These movies are not made for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>uninitiated</em></a>. They are not made for public consumption. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Your
 inability to understand what is at stake here is what makes you 
reluctant to believe how much thought is given to some of the scenes in 
these movies.</em></strong></span> I do better than most in analyzing 
their meaning because I am a highly abstract thinker, but I am quite 
sure that even I miss tons of stuff, enough to fill a book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final entry in this timeline of end-time warnings is indirectly referenced in the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie, a fact that changed my life because for me it represented final proof that the people I call the <em>progeny of Jove</em> wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/"><em>The Revelation</em></a>. I dedicate an entire page to this asterism. It is central to everything that is happening around us now. The page is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The Great Wonder was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (923)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="font-size: 32px;"><li><span class="entry">September 23, 2017</span>:
 This was the date of an asterism described in Revelation 12:1-2. “And 
there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, 
and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 
and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be 
delivered.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>This has been <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the</em></strong></span> end-time marker for over two millennia now. The five-year “course correction” in <em>The Black Hole</em>
 is added to the year of this asterism in order to arrive at 2022 as the
 year of the Earth crustal displacement. Thus endeth what I like to 
characterize as a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>fireworks finally of end-time warnings</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>

trilogy.</em>
 I am sure Robert Zemeckis appreciates their work, but I owe it to 
myself to point out that much of the esoteric symbolism in these movies 
was missed, and with it, <em>profoundly important messages the director was trying to convey</em>. I discuss this material below in the section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#Things_the_Apophenia_Productions_missed"><em>Things the Apophenia Productions missed</em></a>. And of course, the most important but tenuously connected move of all is <em>Virus</em> (1980), and Apophenia Productions missed that entirely. One cam only assume the MMM</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">These two movies are part of a closely interconnected trilogy of movies. This section discusses <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em>. <em>Virus</em>
 (1980) is discussed in the next section. That is the last section on 
this homepage for a reason. I fear many of you will die of a more 
virulent strain of the coronavirus over the next year or so. You see, 
this really is not a game. It’s not a crossword puzzle. It’s not about 
blogging or Internet surfing. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is reality.</em></strong></span>
 This is the work of good men who have made very real sacrifices to warn
 you about what is happening. So I will just tell you bluntly; you need 
to come at this subject with a measure of humility. You need to stop 
listening to the herd mentality. A lot of really good people are trying 
to help you see what is really happening. We all die alone. Don’t let

<div class="intro">Five million views</div>
<p>This section owes its existence to a YouTube video that is fast 
approaching five million views. It is entitled “BACK TO THE FUTURE 
predicts 9/11” but I do not regard it as an example of what is called 
“predictive programming.” There is a very subtle difference between 
movies such as <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, which are designed to 
mold thought in such a way that it will accept a hitherto unknown 
reality such as landing on the Moon that a majority of individuals may 
otherwise question and then reject. Predictive programming is used to 
prepare the ground for something being foisted on an unsuspecting 
public. What’s happening with this trilogy of movies is something vastly
 different. <em>We are being warned.</em> We are being told who is 
responsible for 9/11 and COVID-19. Predictive programming is 
manipulative. These movies are not. It’s a question of motive. Generally
 speaking, only the bankers engage in predictive programming. <em>But that’s not the only thing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-GqOVcDG0LibYX4TjAeCg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">barelyHuman11</a> YouTube channel gets wrong.</em>
 Whoever is responsible for this video is not aware of the different 
factions within the progeny of Jove and is oblivious to what happened in
 Elizabethan England. Because of this, other important evidence is 
overlooked, some things are misunderstood, and worst of all, the third 
and arguably the most important movie in this trilogy was completely 
missed. Nonetheless, this video is extremely well done. And without it, I
 may not have ever learned about <em>The Walk</em> and most certainly would have never learned about <em>Virus</em> (1980). So let us start at what was for me the beginning.</p>

</div></figure><p>The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> was released 
July 3, 1985. It is utterly preposterous to suggest that the producers 
and writers of this movie knew exactly what would happen on September 
11, 2001, over 16 years later. If this is what you are thinking, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>you are dead wrong</em></strong></span>.
 I will analyze this YouTube video throughout this and the next section,
 but first there is some basic information I need to communicate to the

<div class="intro">Philippe Petit</div>
<p>What I am about to say will upset some of you. This is a problem I encounter often, <em>a failure to appreciate the scale of what is happening</em>.
 What Philippe Petit did was astonishingly brave, but he was nonetheless
 an actor on a real-life stage. What I am telling you is that the idea 
for the movie <em>The Walk</em> was conceived of long before Philippe Petit was approached and asked to walk a tightrope between the Twin Towers. <em>If you do not allow yourself to accept this reality, you cannot appreciate what is happening with this trilogy of movies.</em>
 These are end-time warnings. Their portent is infinitely more important
 than what Philippe Petit did on August 7, 1974. In short, Philippe 
Petit was hired by the&nbsp;Ћinkers to walk a tightrope between the Twin
 Towers as part of <em>The Walk</em>. The movie is not really about him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is allegorical.</em></strong></span> Philippe Petit is not the only one risking his life. Here I am reminded of something the Nazarene said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Matthew 13:13</strong><br>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="intro">What’s with the wire?</div>
<p>It is insanely important that you accept Philippe Petit was hired to 
walk on a tightrope between the Twin Towers and spent a significant part
 of his life preparing to do so. If he were to fail, the <em>pièce de résistance</em> of over 400 years of work,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>our final end-time warning</em></strong></span>,—and the absolute proof that the bankers are responsible for what happened on September 11, 2001, would be lost to mankind. <em>Don’t you let that happen because of your closed mind.</em>
 Understanding that Philippe Petit was an actor on a real-life stage is 
the doorway through which you enter into the world of the initiated. <em>It
 is your opportunity to leapfrog a lifetime of skullduggery to knowing 
what only a select handful of 33° Royal Arch Freemasons ever knew.</em> So I am going to replay the part of the Apophenia Productions video that discusses the “reveal” as they called it. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is the wire.</em></strong> <strong><em>The wire is everything.</em></strong></span>
 For Philippe Petit and most movie watchers, it stretches between the 
two Twin Towers. For the Ћinkers, it represents an equally death-defying
 exercise of disclosing who is really responsible for 9/11. For them, 
the wire stretches back in time to 1962 when they first learned from 
Robert Zemeckis that the Twin Towers would be destroyed on September 11,
 2001.&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is the symbolic tightrope.</em></strong></span>
 I know a little bit about walking on it, which is why I watched most of
 this movie fighting back tears and occasionally sobbing uncontrollably.
 At some very real level, the symbolism of this movie is the only 
companionship I have left in life. Knowledge of the end time will 
isolate you from those around you with the same certainty as Phillipe 
Petit walked alone on the real wire.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Robert Zemeckis</div>
<p>In the credits, <em>Back to the Future</em> is “A Robert Zemeckis Film” and he helped to write the screenplay, directed, and co-produced <em>The Walk</em>. <em>The Walk</em> purports to be based on the book <em>To Reach the Clouds</em> by Philippe Petit, originally published in 2002. <em>But this is not the truth.</em> How could it be if <em>Back to the Future</em>
 foretells the making of this movie in 1985? This movie is about 
something much larger than the life of one man. It is an allegory for 
what has been happening ever since the Ћinkers first learned that the 
World Trade Center was going to be destroyed.</p>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">The Walk is allegorical</div>
<p>In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, people like me are free to 
speculate about what really happened on that fateful day, but these men 
have known the truth since 1962 and any attempt on their part to expose 
what was going to happen or who was responsible would be a death 
sentence. Robert Zemeckis is obviously one of those men, but there are 
plenty of others. I refer to them as the <em>Ћinkers</em>, but at this 
time in history, they are primarily a highly select group the Freemasons
 in the South.&nbsp;These men are responsible for all of the end-time 
warnings discussed on this page. And all of them have been walking a 
tightrope ever since they learned the truth about what was going to 
happen to the World Trade Center and decided to let the people know. 
Listen carefully to the following clip from <em>The Walk</em> and you will hear what I am saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your instincts tell you not to trust me. You want someone in 
authority to come out and just tell you plainly that the people 
responsible for 9/11 and COVID-19 are citizens of the United States of 
America. But what you fail to realize is that the penalty for standing 
on that soapbox—<em>when you command a large audience</em>—is death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Albert_Bert_Newton_Stubblebine_III">General Stubblebine</a>
 paid that price. All of us owe a huge debt of gratitude to the men 
behind these end-time warnings. They have made countless sacrifices so 
that someone like me can proclaim the truth. All you need to do is to 
care enough about yourself to learn their language. They speak in 
numbers: sacred numbers, sacred geometry, dates, runtimes, etc. These 
numbers all have meaning and tell a story.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Guy F. Tozzoli</div>
<p>There can be no doubt whatsoever that the faction of the progeny of 
Jove I dubbed the Ћinkers has known about the World Trade Center for a 
very long time,—since before the construction of the Twin Towers began. 
The evidence for this is overwhelming. However, now I want to speculate 
about who told them. Guy F. Tozzoli’s life is best summarized in this 
New York Times article written at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<blockquote style="margin: auto 13%;">
<p class="wp-h1" style="line-height: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">Guy F. Tozzoli, 90, Who Led Team That Built Twin Towers, Is Dead</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 28px; line-height: 90%; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>By&nbsp;David W. Dunlap</strong></span><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">Feb. 6, 2013</span></p>
<p>“You are going to build the trade center,” Guy F. Tozzoli was told on
 his 40th birthday in 1962 by the head of the Port of New York 
Authority. Eleven years later, he had.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Mr. Tozzoli, among the most important 
figures in the development of the original World Trade Center in Lower 
Manhattan, died on Saturday in Myrtle Beach, S.C. He was 90.</p>
<p>His death was announced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://www.wtcaonline.com/cms_wtca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Trade Centers Association</a>, an international group that he helped found and then led for more than four decades.</p>
<p>As director of the World Trade Department of the Port Authority, Mr. 
Tozzoli not only superintended development of the twin towers, but was 
also given credit for having brought the architect Minoru Yamasaki to 
the job, after admiring a pavilion by Mr. Yamasaki at the 1962 World’s 
Fair in Seattle; for shepherding the enormously popular Windows on the 
World restaurant atop the north tower into existence with his friend, 
the restaurateur Joseph Baum; and for coming up with the idea — while 
shaving one morning — to use the tremendous volume of rubble from the 
trade center excavation as landfill for Battery Park City.</p>
<p>“Tozzoli led the team of dreamers, planners, architects and builders 
who overcame countless obstacles to construct the tallest buildings on 
earth,” James Glanz and Eric Lipton wrote in&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/magazine/08WTC1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times Magazine</a>&nbsp;of
 Sept. 8, 2002. “Sometimes it seemed as if Tozzoli, the director of the 
project for the Port of New York Authority, had personally willed the 
towers into existence — outfoxing enemies, bullying colleagues, 
maneuvering around one intractable problem after another.”</p>

New York Times</figcaption></figure><p>Though it was not Mr. Tozzoli who
 first proposed making the World Trade Center the tallest building in 
the world, he embraced the idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamasaki himself favored a plan to build two 80-story towers, not
 110-story behemoths, Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton wrote in the 2003 book 
“City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center.”</p>
<p>“Yama, I have something to tell you,” they quoted Mr. Tozzoli as 
telling the architect. “President Kennedy is going to put a man on the 
moon. You’re going to figure out a way to build me the tallest buildings
 in the world.”</p>
<p>Patrick J. Foye, the current executive director of what is now known 
as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said Mr. Tozzoli was 
“one of the agency’s groundbreaking pioneers.”</p>
<p>Guy Frederick Tozzoli was born on Feb. 12, 1922, in North Bergen, 
N.J., to Silvio Tozzoli, who owned a construction company, and his wife,
 Rose. He received a bachelor’s degree in analytic mechanics and a 
master’s degree in physics from Fordham University. He served as a 
lieutenant in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War.</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli’s first marriage, to Miriam Lane Johnson, ended in 
divorce. Their children — Susan Tozzoli, Kathleen Bernaldo, Richard, 
William, Michael and Tom — survive him, as do his wife, Cynthia; his 
sister, Rita Albert; and two grandchildren.</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli joined the Port Authority in 1946. As the manager of 
marine terminal planning and construction in the 1950s, he supervised 
the construction of cargo-handling centers in Brooklyn, Port Newark and 
Elizabeth, N.J. Mr. Foye credited him with having helped build the first
 container port in New Jersey.</p>

Credit…Don Hogan Charles/The New York Times</figcaption></figure><p>In
 1960, Austin J. Tobin, who was then executive director of the 
authority, lent Mr. Tozzoli to Robert Moses to help develop the 1964-65 
World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The fair had not even opened 
before Mr. Tozzoli learned of his next horizon while dining with his 
wife at an Italian restaurant on East 14th Street. Mr. Tobin, at a 
nearby table, summoned him over. He wanted to know what Mr. Tozzoli 
thought of the embryonic trade center project, which was then planned as
 a complex on the East River designed by three prominent New York 
architects.</p>
<p>“It looks worse than the bus terminal,” Mr. Tozzoli said, according 
to Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton in the book. “It’s for the birds. I just 
don’t think three architects can do it. It is just impossible.”</p>
<p>On Feb. 12, 1962, Mr. Tobin rewarded Mr. Tozzoli’s candor by telling 
him: “I’m going to create the largest department the Port Authority has 
ever had, the World Trade Department. And I’m going to put you in charge
 of it.”</p>
<p>There were benefits to the job as well as headaches. Mr. Tozzoli 
liked to say that he, his father and his son Michael were the first 
diners at Windows on the World as it was preparing to open to the public
 in 1976. To the disappointment of the chef, however, the elder Tozzoli 
and the young boy both asked for hamburgers and French fries.</p>
<p>As the towers took form in 1970, Mr. Tozzoli was instrumental in establishing the World Trade Centers Association, which&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/business/openers-refresh-button-a-local-dream-of-global-trade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promotes international commerce</a>. In his dual role at the authority and the association, he was caught up in a&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/remembering-the-travel-scandal-at-the-port-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1977 scandal over extravagant travel budgets</a>.
 While not denying that he and his wife had taken many trips to cities 
around the globe at the authority’s expense, Mr. Tozzoli said, “never 
have I put a penny in my pocket.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli remained at the authority until 1987. After retiring, he 
became the full-time president of the association, with an office on the
 77th floor of the north tower.</p>
<p>That was where he was headed on Sept. 11, 2001, hoping to make a 9 
a.m. meeting. Instead, as he approached the Holland Tunnel entrance 
after leaving his home in New Jersey, he saw smoke pouring from a gash 
in the tower, not far from his own office. “&nbsp;‘It’s going to take us
 a long time to fix that,’ Tozzoli said in his gravelly voice to someone
 in the clot of people around him,” Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton wrote in 
the book. No one answered. Then the second plane struck.</p>

<p>So you see it is inconceivable that Guy Tozzoli did not know about 
the plans to destroy the World Trade Center. My reason for thinking he 
is the one who told the Ћinkers or Freemasons of the South is based on 
several things. <em>First and foremost is that only a handful of people 
would have known about the 322 signature on the design of the World 
Trade Center at this early date, and Guy Tozzoli was necessarily one of 
them.</em> Then there is this scene from the movie.</p>

</div></figure><p>The thinking here is not so much that Guy Tozzoli gave Petit a “forever” pass. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>This
 is the last two minutes of the movie and what I sense is that the 
Ћinkers are honoring the man who told them what was going to happen.</em></span></strong>
 He died on February 2, 2013, so there is no risk of the movie exposing 
him. But my real reason for suspecting that Guy Tozzoli is the man who 
told the Ћinkers all about the plan to destroy the World Trade Center is
 this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could have gotten this list of the members of the New York World’s 
Fair 1964-1965 Corporation Executive Committee from any number of 
different sources. This just happens to be from a pamphlet entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/masonic-brotherhood-foundation/"><em>Start of Construction Ceremonies</em> Masonic Brotherhood Center August 20, 1963</a>,
 which I keep in my ASL Library. If you look closely, you will see the 
copyright is dated 1961. In other words, Guy Tozzoli is in close contact
 with the men behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://tomorrowland/" target="_blank"><em>Tomorrowland</em></a>
 immediately before he was hired to build the World Trade Center. If the
 logic of the last sentence escapes you, then what you don’t know is 
that the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie is all about the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">OMG, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Yes!</em></strong></span> And how important it is for you to know this! I find myself once again deeply indebted to <span class="lwptoc_item_label">Apophenia Productions without whom I might have never noticed this. Here are the last 2:53 minutes of their <em>BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em>
 YouTube video. The voice-over is perhaps a little too intense, but the 
message is dead on. For many years now, the Monolith from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>
 has been widely recognized as depicting a television or movie screen. 
And the producers of this video were very astute in their observations 
that whenever the time machine reaches 88 MPH and disappears into the 
past or future, something involving a film is involved, first a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>film booth</em></strong></span>, then the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Town movie theatre</em></strong></span>, and finally in <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>outdoor movie theatre</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="intro">Movies, movies, movies</div>
<p>Everything is movies, either the bankers using “predictive 
programming” to mold our reality with the same precision a potter molds 
clay or the Ћinkers using esoteric symbolism to warn us about the real 
significance of September 11, 2001, and the coming Earth crustal 
displacement. In either case, the preferred method of communication is 
to make a movie. Not counting Stanley Kubrick’s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, there are a total of seven movies discussed on this homepage, all of which were <em>beyond any shadow of doubt</em> produced and directed by the Ћinkers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is not many considering what is at stake.</em></strong></span>
 So to dismiss the possibility that as much thought went into each of 
their scenes as the Bard devoted to his stanzas is naive. And that is 
perhaps one of the most important things you can learn from me. Every 
word, every sentence in any one of these movies may convey as much 
meaning as Shakespeare’s Sonnets.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">I would have never noticed what the 
producers of this video did. As much as I respect them, they missed a 
lot. I am not trying to fault them as much as I want the reader to 
understand <em>why</em> this material was missed. And of course, it is 
critical for you to accept that a movie made in 1985 knew the World 
Trade Center would be destroyed. Only then can you begin to awaken to 
the fact that we really do live in the end time,—that all of this stuff 
is happening for a reason. Once again, please note that the most 
important thing this YouTube video missed is the third movie in the 
trilogy—<em>Virus</em> (1980) which is discussed in the next section.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p class="section-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION STATUS</strong></span>: Added summer of 2021. First draft completed September 26, 2021.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: September 26, 2021</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">I list the Gunpowder Plot as the first of the “things the Apophenia Productions missed” because it was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>a major oversight</em></strong></span>. The linking of <em>Back to the Future</em>
 and the Gunpowder Plot is arguably the main point of the entire movie. 
Why? Because history is repeating itself. Before there was September 11,
 2001, there was November 5, 1605. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What
 is of paramount importance here is that the Gunpowder Plot was a banker
 attack on the nascent Ћinker movement, the very people who are 
responsible for the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings discussed on
 this An Apocalyptic Synthesis homepage.&nbsp;</em> </strong></span>You 
need to be sure of this because history attributes the Gunpowder Plot to
 the Jesuits. Over time, the Jesuits do become a distinct, third group 
within the progeny of Jove (people who know for sure what is about to 
happen and when), but they began life as the bankers taking control of 
the Catholic Church in Rome, as they would later take control of <em>The United States of America</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are talking about the bankers here, not the Jesuits. </em></strong></span>I will return to this subject momentarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the Ћinkers want us to know who is really responsible for what is going to happen on September 11, 2001,—<em>some 16 years, 2 months, 8 days into the future from the movie release date</em> (as in <em>Back to the Future</em>),—<em>but nowadays anyone can do that</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The truth is “9/11” was a sloppy operation.</em></strong></span> The controlled demolition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Building_7_made_a_mockery_of_us_all">building seven made a mockery of us all</a>. The bankers no longer care what we think because we are too close to the end. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What the opening scene is trying to convey is that before September 11, 2001 there was November 5, 1605.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;
 The movie itself makes this clear by the strong emphasis placed on 1:15
 AM in the opening scene followed by the transition of 1:15 AM to 1:16 
AM (an <em>upside down <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>and</strong></span> backwards</em> 911) at the mall. While still at the mall, a more direct reference is made to “9/11” using 1:19 AM (a <em>backwards</em> 911), not once, but twice.</p>

<p>You can see this emphasis on the date of the Gunpowder Plot for 
yourself is this clip from the opening scene. I have captions on to

on the Gunpowder Plot.</div>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;of 1605, in earlier centuries often 
called the&nbsp;Gunpowder Treason Plot&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Jesuit Treason, 
was a failed assassination attempt against&nbsp;King James I&nbsp;by a 
group of provincial&nbsp;English Catholics&nbsp;led by&nbsp;Robert 
Catesby&nbsp;who sought to restore the Catholic monarchy from 
the&nbsp;Church of England&nbsp;after decades of persecution of 
Catholics.</p>
<p>The plan was to blow up the&nbsp;House of Lords&nbsp;during the&nbsp;State Opening of Parliament&nbsp;on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">5 November</span></strong></em></span>
 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which 
James’s nine-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was to be installed as the 
Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after 
hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had 
faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters 
were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas 
Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Ambrose 
Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Fawkes, who had 10 
years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in the 
failed suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the 
explosives.</p>
<p>The plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to&nbsp;William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">26 October</span></strong></span> 1605. During a search of the House of Lords in the evening on 4 November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>36&nbsp;barrels of&nbsp;gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble</em></strong></span>—
and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned 
of the plot’s discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several
 made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men 
at&nbsp;Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those 
shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the 
survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to 
be&nbsp;hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
<p class="citation">Wikipedia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gunpowder Plot</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highlighted the 36 barrels of gunpowder and the fact that this was 
enough explosives to reduce the House of Lords to rubble because that is
 the whole point. The writers want to make a comparison between the 
Gunpowder Plot and 9/11. This is 1605; only seven decades have passed 
since the Jesuits were founded. They are doubtless still loyal to the 
bankers who installed them in Rome. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In
 other words, this is the Old World bankers attempting to blow up 
another, equally important building almost four centuries ago</em></strong></span>.
 A better analogy could not be found and it serves the dual purpose of 
identifying who is going to destroy the World Trade Center (the bankers)
 and who is behind this trilogy of movies (the Ћinkers, who started with
 Sir Francis Bacon in Elizabethan England).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the meaning of these numbers is brilliant evidence that everything said in the YouTube video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/_wp_link_placeholder" data-wplink-edit="true"><em>BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em></a> above is correct, the producers of that video missed it entirely. Why? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Because they do not know anything about the history of the Ћinkers. </em></strong></span>They are in good company though because a quick survey of the Internet shows that in the 36 years since <em>Back to the Future</em>
 was released, no one has been able to figure out what these two dates 
mean. I was able to do so in a matter of minutes, not because I am 
particularly smart, but because I know the importance of what happened 
in Elizabethan England. I pray the reader takes away from this example a
 lesson sufficient to inspire them to read and study my page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>, and to continue this line of inquiry on their own. <em>It does not require you to read or study the Shakespeare plays</em>, only the relevant history of Elizabethan England. Peter Dawkins is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span id="The_OUTATIME_and_AOUT_scenes">The OUTATIME and AOUT scenes</span></h3>
<hr><p>The device that connects these two scenes from different movies 
is nothing less than poetic. There’s a reason for that. I profoundly 
believe that these two scenes taken together represent the very heart 
and soul of Back to the Future and The Walk.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro" style="color: #333333;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">OUTA</span>TIME scene</div>
<p>This is beyond question the most important 4:32 minutes in the trilogy. It is primarily what connects all three movies. The<em> BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em> YouTube video sees the connection to 9/11 in the Twin Pines and all of the 1:19 clocks, <em>but then misses everything else</em>.
 I named this scene after the OUTATIME license plate which is 
prominently displayed when the DMC DeLorean time machine is unveiled for
 the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p>This is the core message of the trilogy,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that we are out of time</em></strong></span>.
 In this section, I will show you the connection of the OUTATIME scene 
to both of the other movies. The scene to which the following clip 
connects to <em>The Walk</em> is the one the invokes the memory of Sir Francis Bacon the most. It does so by quoting from Macbeth.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 20%; font-size: 43px; text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #aaa; line-height: 100%; font-weight: 500;">
<p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br>To the last syllable of recorded time;<br>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br>And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>Signifying nothing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">No one is listening</div>
<p>In that scene, the writers complain that <em>no one is listening</em>. I’ll be honest with you, this scene in <em>The Walk</em> reduced me to tears. The “no one is listening” refrain is one found all over <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 dating as far back as I can remember. I honestly don’t know what drives
 the Freemasons of the South at this point. I can tell you that I have 
written emails to the House of the Temple and most if not all of the 
Royal Arch lodges in the South. In so doing, I gave them my contact 
information because I wanted them to know who I am. What perplexes me is
 their intended audience. If they only want Freemasons to know what is 
about to happen, why make movies? It’s illogical. They have their own 
organization in which they can spread the message by word of mouth. That
 they have invested an untold amount of money and years of meticulous 
planning to erect the Georgia Guidestones and make all of these movies <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>tells me they want to reach a broader audience</em></strong></span>. But as the corresponding scene from <em>The Walk</em>
 makes clear, they have failed. No one is listening. The Georgia 
Guidestones have suffered more graffiti than a New York subway car. What
 is left?</p>
<div class="impact-90">The people must be told in <span style="color: #ff0000;">plain English</span> what is happening.</div>
<p>This is what I am striving to do and the result of my own years of 
failure to reach a broader audience is this new homepage featuring what 
happened on September 11, 2001. This is the end of the road for me. 
These last sections of my new homepage equate to the “no one is 
listening” scene from <em>The Walk</em> in that I cannot do any better. 
I’ve gotten rid of the glitzy poetic stuff. I’ve done my very best to 
take the reader’s attention off of me. All that is left now are the hard
 facts, an honest and accurate interpretation of what the Freemasons of 
the South,—the people I more generally refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>,—have been trying to tell us for 42 years now, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>written in plain English</em></strong></span>.
 There is nothing more that I or anyone else can do. So watch this scene
 carefully, and listen to my explanation. People are trying to save your
 life and in the process are risking theirs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is the tightrope we walk.</em> </strong></span>The bankers are ruthless in their resolve to succeed. Get in their way <em>and you will die</em>. I make light of it by appealing to their magnanimity, but in exposing the connection of the following scene to the <em>Virus</em> (1980) movie, I am entering into unknown territory. <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 is my destiny, my calling if you will,—something genuinely worth dying 
for,—but I want to see the dawn of a new age. I cannot stop writing any 
more than I can stop breathing, so I must and do accept my fate. My only
 reason for saying anything along these lines is to appeal to the reader
 to listen to what the Freemasons of the South are saying. My 
interpretation of what they are saying is correct. Of that, I can assure
 you.&nbsp;</p>

 on the work of Petter Amundsen, we now know beyond any shadow of a 
doubt that 53 is a number used to identify Sir Francis Bacon as the 
primary author of the First Folio. This is the same man who founded the 
Rosicrucians and by extension the Freemasons. The AOUT scene starts with
 the “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow” reference to Macbeth 
mentioned above at 52:49. Wikipedia’s summary of Macbeth is apropos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Macbeth</strong></em> (/məkˈbɛθ/; full title <em><strong>The Tragedy of Macbeth</strong></em>)
 is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first 
performed in 1606.[a] It dramatizes the damaging physical and 
psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for 
its own sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course a reference to the bankers. At 52:59, Philippe 
Petit says, “You’re not listening.” That sentence starts and stops in 
the same second. Then at precisely 53:00, he says, “Why is no one 
listening to me when I talk. Are you paying attention?” Here are the 
dots that are being connected:</p>
<ul><li><span class="entry">OUTATIME</span>: As seen in the above video clip, the emphasis that we are out of time from <em>Back to the Future</em>
 is unmistakable. This is reinforced by the AOUT scene emphasis on “les 
carrottes sont cuites” which translates literally as, “the carrots are 
cooked,” but the meaning is more at “the die is cast.”</li>
<li><span class="entry">AOUT</span>: The writers are using the 53:00 
runtime to self-identify as Freemasons of the South who were from the 
very beginning part of the overall plan of Sir Francis Bacon and the 
Rosicrucians even though they were not founded until a century later. 
Following the advice of Paracelsus, the Rosicrucians remained secret for
 100 years after their founding. Only then were the more public 
Freemasons founded. Thus the question “Why is no one listening to me 
when I talk” is much broader than the apparent context. It applies to 
all of the end-time warnings discussed on this homepage and in much 
greater detail throughout <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>. Given my assertion that there exists a numeric signature (discussed above) that indicates <em>Tomorrowland</em> and <em>The Walk</em>
 are our last two end-time warnings, I regard the question “Why is no 
one listening to me when I talk” as a frank admission of failure. On 
that basis, I argue for the need to speak to people in plain English. 
There was a time not long ago when I maintained a “216 Club” page for 
large donors. That was the only page on which I discussed the year of 
the apocalypse. Now I discuss it everywhere and maintain page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 28. A date with destiny: The year of the apocalypse</a>. Furthermore, there are hundreds of things discussed on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 that you will find nowhere else. Presumably, that is because I tested 
out as one of the most abstract thinkers alive. My point is that the 
people cannot understand this symbolism. That is self-evident to me. So 
either we abandon them, or we speak in plain English. It took me a long 
time to realize the Rosicrucians and Freemasons, and in particular, Sir 
Francis Bacon, are serious Christians. That combined with my heartfelt 
belief that the Nazarene was tortured to death for speaking out on this 
subject, makes abandoning the people, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>not an option</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="entry">88 MILES PER HOUR AND MM-88</span>: In the scene from <em>Back to the Future</em>, Doc says, “My calculations are correct. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re gonna see some serious shit.</em></strong></span>” There is no “if” in the first sentence. <em>The 88 miles per hour and the MM on the Georgia Guidestones cube is the connection to Virus (1980)</em>. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it#:~:text=Viruses%20are%20named%20based%20on,Viruses%20(ICTV)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a>
 (WHO), “Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to 
facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. 
Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses 
are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).”
 I will discuss this further below, but the virus name <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>MM-88</em></strong></span> unmistakenly connects <em>Virus</em> (1980) to the Georgia Guidestones and <em>Back to the Future</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Putting it all together, COVID-19 is an indication that we are 
out of time. The Freemasons of the South are pleading with people to 
listen to them. The problem is that they are talking in a foreign 
language. That is why so much of An Apocalytoc Synthesis is dedicated to
 explaining how to interpret their use of sacred numbers, dates, 
runtimes, etc. I would prefer you learn the language for yourself, but 
I’m not taking any chances. I always interpret their meaning into plain 
English. Even then, no one is listening. The deck is stacked against the
 people. Without further ado, here is the corresponding AOUT scene from <em>The Walk</em>.</p>

<p>If you doubt what I am saying about the OUTATIME and AOUT scenes connecting the <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em> movies,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>two movies separated by 30 years</em></strong></span>,—then you need to realize that AOUT is deliberately misspelled in the latter. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>In French, the name for the month of August is always spelled using a circumflex over the letter Û.</em></span></strong> In other words, the calendar you see in the above scene from <em>The Walk</em> was specially made for the movie. From the <em>First Folio</em> to <em>The Walk</em>,—for 400 years now,—<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">deliberate mistakes are always used by the</span> Ћinkers to grab your attention and indicate the presence of a hidden message</strong>.</em> In this case, the deliberate misspelling of AOUT is what I characterize as an <em>anti-cipher</em>
 on this website. It is a way of assuring us that these two movies are 
connected. Of course, the missing circumflex has the same shape of the 
square in the Freemason Square and Compasses.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph"><em>I don’t</em>. This is a scene from in <em>Back to the Future Part II</em>.
 There is a very strong emphasis on this date. The dramatic music and 
thunderstorm, and the fact that the scene ends with a simple posing of 
the question, <em>Do you know what happened September 15, 1973?</em>, 
leaves me with the feeling that we are being challenged to discover the 
significance of this date. Given that the death occurs in the context of
 George McFly unexpectantly dying in a dystopian alternate reality that 
is a living hell because one intellectual dullard—the character Biff 
Tannen—becomes rich, I am guessing this has something to do with a 
financial scandal.</p>

<p>OLD STUFF…</p>
<p>January 21 or 121 means something or even 21 alone</p>
<p>There is an important link between <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em> that the<em> BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em>
 YouTube video completely missed. At first appearance, this one requires
 no special knowledge, but that is not entirely true. I was in a 
heightened state of mind when watching this scene because it references 
the work of William Shakespeare (i.e. Sir Francis Bacon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a handful of you will ever accept the truth that planning for 
9/11 started even before they broke ground for the World Trade Center on
 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.businessinsider.com/world-trade-center-evolution-in-aerial-images-2018-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 5, 19<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">66</span></strong></a>, where eminent domain was used against the will of the people to demolish <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>13</strong></span> square blocks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Row#Demolition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio Row</a>.</p>

<p>You can even see it in the Blazing Star (a Seyfert galaxy exploding) of <em>The Walk</em>
 poster below. Of the handful that will accept this level of planning, 
even fewer will fully grasp the beauty and simplicity of this movie’s 
symbolism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What <em>The Walk</em> taught me is that the Twin Towers are an <em>end-time marker</em> as important as the Georgia Guidestones and <em>Tomorrowland</em>. Moreover, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>everything is happening in the here and now</em></strong></span>.
 We are “at the doors.” I no longer care what the world thinks. The 
slings and arrows of the worldly-wise no longer matter to me. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are living in the end time.</em></strong></span> One needs only to open their eyes to see it. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I can show you.</em></strong></span></p>

<p>Is predictive programming real? Or is it an example of <em>confirmation bias</em>, <em>selection bias</em>, <em>pareidolia</em>, or <em>apophenia</em> as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/terminology/">№ 104.

 The evidence that Hollywood effectively announced the attack on the

happened is positively overwhelming. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But you be the judge.</em></strong></span></p>

What “numerical perfection” means will escape most readers. It means numerical perfection from <em>multiple perspectives</em>, not just one. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Only when you achieve numerical perfection from multiple perspectives does a “numerical signature” become almost magical.</em></strong></span>
 Then, and only then, do you know that you have arrived at the correct

is not unlike the many different facets of this diamond. It is 
beautiful, <em>but unlike this diamond</em>, such beauty exists only in 
the mind of the beholder. It is a private world few can enter. You gain 
entrance by developing a profound respect for the importance of number. 
It is the religion of the progeny of Jove, one I deeply respect.</figcaption></figure><h2><span id="55_555_and_the_Washington_Monument">55, 555, and the Washington Monument</span></h2>
<hr><p class="section-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION STATUS</strong></span>:
 Added August 13, 2021. Renamed during a major revision on October 2, 
2021, with new material about the significance of the number 555 added 
to the end.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: October 1, 2021</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">Now I am walking on holy ground. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The number 55 is used as a signature by the</strong> Ћinkers.</em></span> Why not use 66 or 666 as a signature? <em>It’s too obvious.</em> When 66 or 666 is used by the Ћinkers—in what I refer to as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/signatures/"><em>numeric signature</em></a>,
—it is the equivalent of making a deliberate mistake such as is found in
 the First Folio and is intended merely to catch your eye, to capture 
your attention. But even more important than that, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>66 and 666 are banker numbers</strong></em></span> they planted in popular thought when they commissioned the writing of <em>The Revelation</em>.</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">When the bankers use these numbers, most recently in the design of the facade for the One World Trade Center,—<em>which, as noted above, is screaming 666 to a deaf world,</em>—they are identifying themselves. The entire discussion on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bonesmen/">№ 74. Skull and Bones 322 and corporate logos</a>
 is the bankers screaming “We own the entire world.” The mere fact that 
they are so casually doing this is one of the most unappreciated signs 
that we are living in the end time. But be clear about this, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>capturing your attention</strong> <strong>versus self-identification are two profoundly different uses of 66 and 666</strong></em></span>,
 one you will better appreciate after reading this section. When the 
Ћinkers want to honor their leader Sir Francis Bacon or emphasize their 
origins in Elizabethan England, they use the number 58 as discussed in 
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/#Introductory_note"><em>Introductory note</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>.
 Quite succinctly put, the number 58 is a reference to the year 1558 in 
which Queen Elizabeth I ascended to the throne. In this way, the Ћinkers
 pay homage to their leader in exactly the same way Catholics revere 
“Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou 
amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus” when they 
say the Rosary. Otherwise, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/signatures/">numeric signature</a> used by the Ћinkers to identify themselves is 55 or 555 as discussed in this section.</p>

<p>I know the numeric symbology used by the progeny of Jove is not as sexy as learning the truth about popular movies such as <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>Tomorrowland</em>,
 but I beg of you to understand that it is precisely because of my 
appreciation for the significance of number that I stand before you able
 to explain the profound importance of these two movies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/website/#III_ALL_IS_NUMBER"><em>All is number</em></a> is one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/website/#The_five_fundamental_principles_of_An_Apocalyptic_Synthesis">five fundamental principles of <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em></a>. You cannot <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>and will not</em></strong></span>
 trivialize the importance of number when studying the progeny of Jove 
for whom number is religion,—one I hold in higher regard than the 
popular expression of “Christianity” in our age,—<em>not if you are a student of my work</em>. Not if you want to learn about what is happening in the world right now. And most importantly of all, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>not is you want to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement</em></strong></span>. I am saying this at a level that the great majority of you cannot understand, but it nonetheless must be said. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Without
 understanding this fundamental principle, your mind will not allow you 
to truly accept what I am saying about the progeny of Jove.</em></strong></span>
 You may think you believe what I am saying. You may even tell others 
about my work and praise it, but I am further down this road than most 
if not all of my readers, and I can assure you it takes a long time for 
your mind to make such a drastic change from the mundane to the <em>reality</em>
 of living in the end time. It is more than an intellectual exercise. 
You will experience this for yourself if you continue to study my work.</p>
<p>For a long time, I withheld information until I saw in myself that 
acceptance of what I was learning was difficult even for me. What you 
need to know is that I am <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>and always have been</em></strong></span>
 my own worst skeptic. Here I would remind the reader I started down 
this road wanting only to write a book about what happened in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/scofield/">3100 BC</a>.
 So realizing how difficult it is for the mind to accept what I am 
saying about the progeny of Jove, I no longer hold back anything. That 
is the confidence I have that very few of you will “come into this 
light,” so to speak, the light of Sir Francis Bacon’s torch, lit over 
400 years ago for the sake of the last generation. Know this, too. It is
 my personal, deep conviction that the Nazarene was brutally murdered 
because of what has become know as the <em>Olivet Discourse</em> discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/olivet/">No. 24. The Olivet Discourse: Matthew 24-25, Mark 13, &amp; Luke 5-36</a>. Since returning from my <em>Five Days on Monjeau Peak</em>, captured in my first TOP video, I answer to these two men, and no other. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The torch was handed to me by the Freemasons of the South.</em></strong></span> Be certain of that. But this is the end time,—<em>my time</em>,—and I acknowledge only two leaders. </p>

<div class="intro">The number of a man</div>
<p>Let me put to rest a debate that still rages after hundreds of years; <em>this is what Revelation 13:18 means when it says “for it is the number of a man.”</em> It is not so much <em>“a man”</em> as it is a <em>mentality</em>, the mentality of the Roman elite, or what we know of today as <em>bankers</em>. And yes, I am quite serious. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 “beast” in Revelation 13:18 is the coming Earth crustal displacement, 
and the “man” in Revelation 13:18 is the mentality such knowledge 
engenders in men whose natural proclivities are by nature despotic.</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Revelation 13:18</strong><br>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>for it is the number of a man</em></strong></span>; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Revelation</em> is little understood in popular thought. If you doubt anything I am saying here, you need to read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bonesmen/">№ 74. Skull and Bones 322 and corporate logos</a>.
 The “man” in Revelation 13:18 is plastering 66 and 666 all over the 
world. The facade of the new One World Trade Center is screaming 666.It 
is my profound belief, after years of study, that while <em>The Revelation</em> was commissioned by the Roman elite for reasons discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>,
 it was written by nascent Ћinkers, who for over two millennia now have 
been talking over the heads of the bankers. The “number of a man” was 
allowed by the bankers no doubt as misdirection. Much of <em>The Revelation</em>
 is misdirection intended for the end time. But I am convinced adding 
“for it is the number of a man” was the Ћinkers inserting a warning into
 the text about the Roman elite, or the mentality I refer to as the <em>bankers</em>.
 In light of everything I have explained on this page about the true 
nature of what happened on September 11, 2001, when you look at that 
building, the <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One World</strong></span> Trade Center</em>, what you should be thinking about is what the Nazarene says in Matthew 24.</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Matthew 24:15-16</strong></p>
<p>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>whoso readeth, let him understand</strong></span>) then let them which be in Judæa flee into the mountains</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I digress.</p>

<div class="intro">55</div>
<p>Let us now talk about the numerical significance of 55. As discussed 
below, 55 precedes 66 in the sequence of triangular numbers. This is 
actually significant to the progeny of Jove. The bankers are always 
undermining the Ћinkers for claiming to have come first. That is what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/matrix/#Advanced_trigonometry_in_Plimpton_322">Plimpton 322</a> is all about. It has advanced trigonometry the ancient Greeks claim to have developed on their own.</p>

<p>But the truth remains the bankers started in Rome where they learned 
everything they know about the coming Earth crustal displacement from 
the Greeks in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Graecia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magna Graecia</a>. As stated in Wikipedia,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greeks had settled in Southern Italy and Sicily since the 8th century
 BCE. In this way, Italian tribes came into contact with Greek culture 
very early on and were influenced by it. The alphabet, weights and 
measures, coinage, many gods and cults (see <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_romana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interpretatio romana</a></i>) as well as the building of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temples</a> were derived from the Greeks.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_relations_in_classical_antiquity#cite_note-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_relations_in_classical_antiquity#cite_note-scholastic-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 55 is much more subtle and less well known than 66 is 
what makes it possible for the Ћinkers to parade around the number 55 
(or two fives) in the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie without being noticed. For example, the common denominator for time in <em>Tomorrowland</em> is seconds. The extended runtime for <em>Tomorrowland (Plus Bonus Features)</em> is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>3:04:55</strong></em></span>, which is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">108</span></strong>00:<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">24</span></strong>0:<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span> . The <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>108</em></strong></span> says <em>this is a sacred message</em>. The <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">24</span></strong></em> says <em>about the end of the world</em>. And the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>55</em></strong></span> says <em>from the Freemasons in the South</em> (who in the context of a much larger time frame spanning millennia, I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>). They use the number 55 or two fives in <em>Tomorrowland</em> so extensively that I recognized and wrote about it long before I understood its meaning.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p></p>
<div class="intro">Utter perfection</div>
<p>I characterize the number 55 as <em>holy ground</em> in part because,
 if the Ћinkers are using 55 as their signature, you should expect it to
 be numerically perfect in all of its multifaceted uses. I find it 
difficult to express exactly what this means. It takes time to learn 
this, but when something is really important to the Ћinkers, you will 
find it has a kaleidoscope of meanings any one of which may make you 
think you have figured it all out. In fact, I would say the first time 
you experience this,—namely, that a number or numerical signature you 
thought you fully understood only to find that it has a profound new 
meaning you never encountered before,—is when you will begin to 
understand what I mean by “numerical perfection.” I stand in awe of the 
Ћinkers for this and often find myself wondering with all the hundreds 
of years they had to plan the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings, <em>how exactly they did so</em>.
 How much thought they must have given to everything! But you see, 
that’s the whole thing. Numbers are their religion and they understand 
them infinitely more than I could ever hope working on my own in the 
short time left to me to discover everything their is to know in there 
world. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Only the Brotherhood could do this.</em></strong></span> I recently received a very subtle message that compared me to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/youtube/#Donald_Duck_in_Mathmagic_Land"><em>Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land</em></a>.
 I laughed uncontrollable for no little time and with what I can only 
describe as a feeling of joy. When I finally stopped laughing, I felt 
honored. <em>I felt a level of acceptance and acknowledgement that I have not known my entire life.</em>
 Coming from these men, it was anything but an insult. I openly 
acknowledge my status as a babe in the woods, as long as all the players
 realize my purpose is to do harm to no man. God, the fabric of the 
universe, is giving me the opportunity to do what I think you should 
have done 2,600 years ago. I seek only to reach those who, like me, can 
hear the ancients screaming at us. No one must interfere with my ability
 to do this work. To that end, I repeat the warning of the bankers from <em>The Revelation</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Revelation 22:18-19</strong><br>For I testify unto every man 
that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall 
add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are 
written in this book: 19 and if any man shall take away from the words 
of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the 
book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are 
written in this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not alone. My “thinker” is not brain. And while this body of 
mine is fragile, the beings I met in Seligman, Arizona, are capable of 
reducing that multi-trillion-dollar tunnel system to a ruble pile not 
unlike that of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. I know 
beyond any shadow of a doubt that you have your own record of that event
 from the facilities at 35° 21′ 09.88″ N 112° 56′ 59.45″ W. Though I 
have not seen them since, <em>I live with the confidence that they know of my whereabouts and what I am doing</em>.
 I wish godspeed to you men, but let us each play our respective role in
 this closing act of the Fifth World. Shutting down my thinker would be a
 mistake.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>

Allow me to say this again for emphasis, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>55 is the largest Fibonacci number that is also a triangular number</strong></em></span>.
 66 is a pyramid number (representing ancient knowledge of the coming 
Earth crustal displacement), but it is not a Fibonacci number. <em>By combining being a Fibonacci number with also being a pyramid number, wisdom is added to equation.</em> Think about what I just said when you read that 666 is the “number of a man” in Revelation 13:18.<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></strong></em></figcaption></figure><p>The number 55 is very special in that, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/27-2/ming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luo Ming</a> proves, <em>it is the largest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fibonacci</a> number that is also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triangular number</a></em>. And the next number in the sequence of triangular numbers is 66. So 55 is juxtaposed with the “Here is wisdom…” number in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/"><em>The Revelation</em></a>, a book commissioned by the Roman elite and then later planted in the Bible by Constantine the Great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another aspect of the purely numerical significance of this 
number for the Ћinkers, one it may take you some time for which to 
develop an appreciation. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>55 is the point at which the Fibonacci sequence as aspect ratios rounds to 1.618</em></strong>.</span> You must read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/fibonacci/">№ 76.

<p>Why people ever express the Golden Ratio (1.61803398875 as returned 
by a Google search) as anything other than 1.618 escapes me. The next 
number is the decimal fraction is zero, which sort of begs rounding.</p>

 when officially opened on October 9, 1888, the Washington Monument was 
the tallest building in the world.

<div class="intro">555</div>
<p>The remainder of this section is somewhat apologetic because it has 
taken me so long to realize that 555 is to 55 what 666 is to 66. In 
other words, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>555 is a numeric signature of the</strong> <strong>Ћinkers</strong></em></span>. It is the Ћinker equivalent of 666 as used by the bankers. Let me say this again for emphasis.</p>
<div class="impact-72" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">555</span> is the Ћinker equivalent of <span style="color: #ff0000;">666</span></div>
<p>Long before writing this section, I had already learned that 55 is 
the Ћinker equivalent of 66. What this section will aptly demonstrate is
 that the same same is true for 555 and 666. This all seems obvious to 
me now. I really cannot explain why it took so long to see it because I 
have been aware of the number 555 for years. For some unknown reason, I 
dismissed it over and over again. In my defense, while there is a 
certain mathematical perfection to the number 55, <em>555 is not prime. 
It is not a Fibonacci number. It is not a triangular number. 555 is not 
in any way I can surmise numerically significant</em> other than being 
the Ћinker equivalent of 666. That still comes as somewhat of a surprise
 to me even as I write this. The numerical perfection is found in the 
number 55. 555 is nothing more than an extension of 55 in order to 
mirror the 666 found in the Revelation 13:18 “Here is Wisdom” verse of 
the Bible.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">A look inside</div>
<p>All of this makes me think a discussion of how I realized 555 is a 
numerical signature of the Ћinkers would be useful to readers who are 
awakening to the progeny of Jov<em>e <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“A</strong></span></em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>ll is number”</em> </strong></span>mindset, one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/website/#The_five_fundamental_principles_of_An_Apocalyptic_Synthesis"><em>five fundamental principles of An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em></a>.
 In fact, what I want to do now is to let you inside and explain 
somewhat how it was possible for a highly abstract thinker to dismiss 
555 for so long when I realize now it is critically important to two of 
the most important,—if not <em>the</em> most important,—scenes in <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>Tomorrowland.</em>
 I will be discussing those two scenes in the following subsections in 
part as a continuation of this “an inside look” exercise. Here I am just
 discussing the use of 555. <em><br></em></p>
<p>The genius of <em>Back to the Future</em> is its popular appeal. This
 movie is insanely important to anyone studying the progeny of Jove, 
particularly the opening scene. Once I realized this and saw that the 
scene ended at precisely 5:55 when Marty McFly (MM) hangs up the phone, I
 could no longer ignore the significance of the number 555. The first 
thing I did was to search my own work. My most recent encounter with 
this number was while working on what I am calling <em>Line V</em>, which is discussed below. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>555 miles is the distance from the cornerstone of the former Masters Building in New York City</em></strong></span>—where it is widely believed that the Stone of Destiny (or Holy Grail) is encased in concrete—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>to Nolan’s Cross on Oak Island, Nova Scotia</em></strong></span>. Different aspects of this utterly absurd notion are discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/">№ 55. The Stone of Destiny and New Atlantis</a>, page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/">№ 50. Shakespeare’s last play: Oak Island (a tragic comedy)</a>,
 as well as below on this homepage. Ever since I first dismissed this 
particular instance of 555, somewhere “in the back of my head” I knew I 
was wrong. <em>555 meant something.</em> The reason I am writing this section now is because I am about to discuss a scene from <em>Back to the Future</em> and another from <em>Tomorrowland</em>,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>both of which I would not hesitate to describe as the most important scenes in their respective movies</em></strong></span>,
—in which 555 is clearly being used as what I call a “numerical 
signature.” As I say over and over again on this website, these 
numerical signatures are the progeny of Jove’s greatest weakness. They 
offer a backdoor into the world of the “initiated” and make it possible 
for us common folk to learn their secrets as surely as if we were 
reading from a book. <em><br></em></p>
<p>Knowing what happened to the Stone of Destiny after it was presented 
to Nicolas Roerich in 1923 is a curiosity of mine because it is believed
 that whoever possesses this artifact will survive the coming Earth 
crustal displacement. At present you will read about my belief that it 
was given to the bankers in Denver, Colorado to “make the peace” and 
wish them godspeed, or worse, so that the bankers would invite the 
Ћinkers to survive what is about to happen in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">the multi-trillion-dollar tunnel system</a>
 in the Pikes Peak batholith in the Front Range. While it will take 
months for me to remove all trace of this ridiculous belief from the 
website, I now believe it never left their possession. The Ћinkers would
 never give the Stone of Destiny to the bankers. <em>Never.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Ever.</em></strong></span>
 This 555 miles is one part of an important two-part message that the 
Stone of Destiny is still in the possession of the Freemasons of the 
South, <em>as it has been since the founding of this country</em>. They 
were just parading it for the whole world to see, perhaps because it was
 once in the possession of the bankers when they were known as the 
Knights Templar. </p>
<p>The other reference to 555 I discovered while researching my own work is the Washington Monument. If I were to take you back <em>more than a few years</em>,
 I would tell you that, when I first read that the dimensions of the 
Washington Monument are hidden references to 66 and 666, I thought the 
Freemasons were somehow evil, as do a great many misguided souls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the substructure completed, the builders then proceeded to the 
above-ground marble structure, 55 feet, 1.5 inches square at the base…<br>…<br>Rather
 than ascend to 600 feet as Mills had intended in the original plan, 
Casey was persuaded to make the height of the structure ten times the 
width of the base, meaning the optimal height for the Washington 
Monument was 555 feet.</p>
<p class="citation">National Park Service, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.nps.gov/wamo/learn/historyculture/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>History &amp; Culture</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before being remeasured by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey in 2013,
 the monument had been measured by the National Park Service (part of 
the Department of the Interior, which has been dominated by the 
Freemasons from its inception) in 1884. It’s height according to that 
measurement is 555 feet 5.125 inches.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">555</span> feet is <span style="color: #ff0000;">666</span>0 inches.</div>
<p>According to Wikipedia’s Washington Monument article, the height is a combination of “a 500-foot tall column surmounted by a <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span>-foot</em> tall pyramidion.” And according to the National Park Service, the monument is <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">55</span> feet</em> wide at the base.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">55</span> feet is <span style="color: #ff0000;">66</span>0 inches.</div>
<p>We note also that a square with 55 foot sides has a perimeter of <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">22</span></strong>0 feet</em>.
 This is a non-trivial fact about the number 55 which I do not mention 
anywhere else. I mention it here because George Washington’s birthday is
 February 22 or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>222</em></strong></span>.
 Whether that has anything to do with this monument in the shape of an 
ancient Egyptian obelisk, I cannot say. But neither can I ignore such 
details. </p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Interpretation</div>
<p>Before I discuss how to interpret these references to 66 and 666, it 
needs to be said that George Washington is perhaps the most celebrated 
Ћinker since the Bard. But these are banker numbers. Why? Why indeed! <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The</strong> 55-foot tall pyramidion is begging us to answer this question</em></span>
 of why these measurements were used for the Washington Monument and by 
extension why I keep encountering them in my work. Think about sections 
such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/#Construction_start_and_end_dates_for_the_House_of_the_Temple_in_Washington_DC"><em>Construction start and end dates for the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one">№ 11. The centuries old war between the bankers and Ћinkers</a>.
 Always right below the surface of Ћinker symbolism there is a seething 
antipathy for the malfeasance of bankers throughout our history. This is
 the tallest building in the world at the time. And <em>The United States of America</em> is the <em>Land of the End Times</em>. The thinkers are making a powerful statement in this use of 55 and 555, but what is it?</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Sophistry</div>
<p class="first-paragraph">I think the answer to this question is 
simple, at least from where I stand now. The meaning of such numeric 
symbolism has always been <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>deceptively simple</em></strong></span>.
 The progeny of Jove count on the pretentious, pompous, and 
self-aggrandizing character of most men to hide the simplicity of their

<p>My readers know that I am married to simplicity. From the G is 
Freemasonry to the 66 and 666 the bankers are plastering all over the 
world in their corporate logo designs, the symbolism used by the progeny
 of Jove is always <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>deceptively simple</em></strong></span>.
 Throughout the ages, the progeny of Jove have always counted on the 
pretentious, pompous, and self-aggrandizing character of the men who 
join their ranks as “novices”—<em>in the vain hope of discovering some profound secret the “masters”are sworn to keep on pain of death</em>—
to mislead and beguile them. This is how they obfuscate the truth about 
their symbols. In this sense, men like Manly P. Hall have done us a 
great disservice. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>No one ever expects simplicity.</em></strong></span> Thus in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://scottishritenmj.org/blog/the-origins-of-the-square-and-compasses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Origins of the Square and Compasses</em></a>
 (not that anyone in the Northern Jurisdiction would know or even care) 
we read, “The square and compasses are architect’s tools, and many say 
that the commonly seen G in the middle represents geometry.” <em>This is utter nonsense.</em>
 When such Freemason articles contain the truth, it is usually well 
hidden in one or two sentences, some passing comment so casually 
mentioned that unless you already know the truth you would never even 
pay any attention to what was said. I have seen this over and over 
again. Nothing exhibits the point I am making more so than the letter G 
introduced into Freemasonry symbolism upon their arrival on the shores 
of North America. All the talk about God, the Great Architect, and 
Geometry is so much mindless prattle. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It means granite.</em></strong></span> <em>It has always meant granite and is a reference to the Pikes Peak <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>granite</strong> </span>batholith.</em> Thus I dispose of all the pretense.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">Everything is <span style="color: #ff0000;">one thing</span>.</div>
<p>Learning this does not require membership is a secret society. It 
does not requires years of learning, delving into obscure texts, the 
meaning of which is impossible to fathom. The world is about to end in 
an Earth crustal displacement that will reduce mankind to something far 
less than the 500,000,000 predicted on the Georgia Guidestones. That’s 
the big secret. If you want to learn about philosophy or metaphysics, 
you will not learn it from the progeny of Jove. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are getting ready for the end.</em></strong></span>
 That is the extent of what they know. They don’t know this because they
 are prophets, sages, or wise men by any other name. They know it 
because they learned it from other men. <em>This knowledge has been passed down from a previous world age.</em> At this point in history, I describe the men who know as the <em>progeny of Jove</em>. They consist primarily of three groups: the Ћinkers; the bankers; and the Jesuits. The rest of us are the walking dead.</p>
<p>But I digress. So many digressions. Why? Because I am standing on 
holy ground. The measurements of the Washington Monument contain an 
important message relative to our interpretation of the scenes from <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>Tomorrowland</em> in the following subsections. </p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Conclusions</div>
<p>Other than the mathematical significance of 55, it is quite possible 
that 55 and 555 are used as numeric signatures by the Ћinkers precisely 
because of this feet to inches conversion to 660 and 6660. The meaning? 
In answering this question, I am reminded of the loudspeaker in the 
opening scene in Back to the Future. Marty McFly is thrown backwards by 
an outrageously large loudspeaker. The Freemasons of the South had a 
unique opportunity when deciding on the dimensions of what would be the 
tallest building in the world and an important monument for The United 
States of America. They chose to keep it simple. Their message? It is 
through them, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>through their numerical signature of 55 and 555</em></strong></span>, that you will learn about the bankers in the end time. That’s it. And this is how I came to know the meaning of 555. </p>

<hr><p class="section-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION STATUS</strong></span>: Added October 7, 2021. First draft. Needs editing and proofreading. <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: October 7, 2021</p>
<p class="first-paragraph"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Back to the Future trilogy is centered around the year 1955.</em></strong></span> There is nothing subtle about this. As noted in the section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#The_progeny_of_Jove"><em>The progeny of Jove</em></a>
 above, the Ћinkers have three ways of signing their work, and of these 
three, the number 55 is clearly the most sacred. Hence, I tell you of a 
truth that the original <em>Back to the Future</em> is of profound importance to the Ћinkers, third only to <em>The Walk</em> (a celebration of their accomplishments) and <em>Tomorrowland</em> (the last end-time warning for the masses). The date November 11 is discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#The_Gunpowder_Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>
 above. But the 55 in 1955 is the Ћinkers shouting at the top of their 
lungs that this movie is highly symbolic and worthy of the same respect 
one feels for the Bible. This section discusses the most important scene
 in <em>Back to the Future</em>, which is the first 5:55 minutes. The 
profundity of this opening scene cannot be exaggerated. Once you see it 
for what it is, you may consider yourself “initiated.” I can assure you 
that many 33° Freemasons have lived and died without knowing as much as 
you will know after reading this section. So try to be respectful. <em>This is not an intellectual game.</em> I cannot say this to often. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is life and death.</em></strong></span>
 This is a discussion about the end of the Fifth World. And when that 
“day of the Lord” arrives, everything and everyone you have ever known 
will be erased from the face of the Earth. Only <em>The United States of America</em> will live on in the myths of a future world we can only imagine.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">19<span style="color: #ff0000;">55</span> and the first <span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>:<span style="color: #ff0000;">55</span> minutes</div>

<div style="height:54px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p>The genius of <em>Back to the Future</em> is in its popular appeal, which of course is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Oedipus complex</a>.
 Hidden underneath this thin, incestual veneer of boys secretly wanting 
to have sex with their mother is one of two critically important 
confirmations that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the bankers
 began life as the Roman elite after learning of the coming Earth 
crustal displacement from the ancient Greeks in Magna Graecia</em></strong></span>. I take particular interest is this <em>Back to the Future</em> scene because I was out on a limb all by myself <em>for years</em>
 asserting that the Roman elite had morphed into the bankers. I have 
learned to trust my intuition as few men do, but finding Ћinker support 
after standing alone for so many years always feels like God’s hand of 
approval on my shoulder. It’s not so much pride as it is relief. Being 
alone in such lofty intellectual matters is not easy, but it is what has
 made it possible for me to get this far. The other confirmation that 
the Roman elite morphed into the bankers is in what I call <em>Line V</em> (because it took me <em>five attempts</em> working with Google Earth to find what I was looking for), which starts at the cornerstone of the former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/#The_Stone_of_Destiny_is_not_buried_in_the_cornerstone_of_the_former_Masters_Building">Masters Building</a> where some seriously misguided people think the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/">Stone of Destiny</a> (or Holy Grail) is entombed in concrete. Line V crosses in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/cathedral/">The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine</a>, remarkably close to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/">Oak Island</a>
 to make a statement about what is happening there, near to the St. John
 Port Authority in Newfoundland where Sir Francis Bacon and his men had 
their base of operations while preparing Oak Island to be the subject of
 what I am calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/"><em>Shakespeare’s last play</em></a>, and from there it crosses over the Atlantic to Southern France.</p>

<p>Line V terminates at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier_Cathedral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montpellier Cathedral</a> in the former province of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languedoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Languedoc</a> where it is believed the Stone of Destiny was rescued from Rennes-le-Château by the Knights Templar and taken taken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.rosslynchapel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosslyn Chapel</a>
 in Scotland. But before reaching the Montpellier Cathedral, as can be 
seen in the image above, Line V passes through the city of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cahors</a>, France, featured in the the last of the three rings of the <em>Seventh Circle of Hell</em> in Canto XVII of Dante’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Inferno</em></a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The medieval town of Cahors, France is precisely where the Roman elite transformed themselves into bankers.</em></strong><span style="color: #000000;">
 Note that this happened long before they donned the robes of the 
Knights Templar. The Ћinkers have immortalized this fact in what I am 
calling <em>Line V</em>, which I am pretty damn sure is discussed nowhere else on the Internet or in books or magazines. </span></span>Line V is a recent discovery of mine, but I will be discussing different aspects of it on pages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/">№ 55. The Stone of Destiny and New Atlantis</a> and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/"> № 50. Shakespeare’s last play: Oak Island (a tragic comedy)</a>. But the way Robert Zemeckis addresses this subject is radical from my perspective. Prior to the publication of this section, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>no one has ever even noticed what he is doing</strong></em></span>.
 How is the even possible? This is one of the most popular movies of all
 time. Don’t ask me that question because I knew to discover the meaning
 of 753 the first time I watched this movie.</p>

<p>The opening scene in <em>Back to the Future</em> is a bunch of clocks. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The time is 7:53.</em></strong></span> <em>But what does this mean? </em>The answer is this question is simple. The founding of Rome is widely dated to April 21, 753 BC. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But
 understanding,—truly understanding,— and grappling with the profound 
significance of the meaning of 753 in the opening scene of Back to the 
Future is enough for me to declare the reader “initiated.”</em></strong></span>&nbsp;
 I can’t send you any fancy ribbons or badges to wear on your breast to 
demonstrate that you have successfully “come out from among them, and be
 ye separate,” but you will know it in your heart, and this is all that 
matters at this late date. Your mind will have taken a critical step in 
awakening to the need to be prepared at all cost to “flee into the 
mountains” when the time comes. For everyone else reading this, it’s 
just a stupid intellectual game in which I am trying to appeal to a 
wider audience to boost my ego, or whatever fits into their twisted 
world view.</p>
<p>The paramount question is, Why are the Ћinkers emphasizing the founding of Rome in the opening scene of <em>Back to the Future</em>?&nbsp; The first hint is found in the newspaper articles that immediately follow the clocks.</p>

 things are happening at this point, one far more important than the 
other. Notice that “BROWN MANSION DESTROYED” is pinned on top of the 
other article that mentions bankruptcy, <em>bank</em> being the 
operative word. So the “developers” burned down the Brown mansion after 
acquiring it in bankruptcy. The developers of the World Trade Center 
were the bankers, and they too burned it down. As discussed in the 
section entitled the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#The_Gunpowder_Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> above, the bankers burning down buildings is a central theme of this movie. Why? Because metaphorically speaking, <em>Back to the Future</em>
 is the Ћinkers making their first steps onto the 13, 607 day long 
tightrope that defines the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings and 
stretches from the release date of <em>The Black Hole</em> on December 21, 1979 to the release date of <em>The Walk</em>
 on September 30, 2015 “firework finale” of end-time warnings. But 
please sit down because if what I am about to say doesn’t give you 
reason to pause and accept <em>An Apocalypse Synthesis</em> at a whole new level, nothing will. This shocked even me when I finally discovered why the Ћinkers released <em>Back to the Future</em> on July 3, 1985. And I do mean <em>finally</em>. This took years. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>All I knew was that they released the movie the day before Independence Day for a specific reason.</em></strong></span></p>

That is the year the familiar second edition of Sir Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis was published. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Now that is my definition of walking a tightrope.</span></div>
<p>I’ll leave it as an exercise for the skeptical reader to discover why
 waiting until the next day on July 4, 1985 to release the movie and 
thereby referencing the First Edition of <em>New Atlantis</em> published in 1627 was never really an option. (<span class="entry">HINT</span>: it has a lot to do with this image to the left.) Why <em>New Atlantis</em>? Because the Ћinkers are making a statement about bankers and what they’ve done with <em>The United States of America</em> after defeating the descendants of the Founding Fathers in the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/civil-war/">Civil War</a>. Our country never had a chance after that. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>We would have been a truly great country under the leadership of the</strong> Ћinkers.</em></span> And of course, <em>New Atlantis</em> is an unfinished work, as was the destruction of the World Trade Center on July 3, 1985. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It’s really rather poetic.</em></strong></span> I want to emphasize that the release date for <em>Back to the Future</em> referencing Sir Francis Bacon’s <em>New Atlantis</em> is <em>proof the the date September 11, 2001 was known long before what the public knows of as “9/11.” </em></p>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">Wake up people!</div>
<p>You are living in the end time. And I don’t care what you think about
 me, but God has prepared me for this website my entire life, if not 
before I was even born. A highly decorated Vietnam veteran across the 
street from me in my new house in San Antonio, Texas unexpectedly 
visited a couple of days ago. He is a professional genealogist now and 
offered to prepare a report on the maternal side of my family from which
 I took my grandfather’s name after discovering I was a bastard child. 
It turns out my family was instrumental in helping to win the 
Revolutionary war. I am by rights a Sons of the Revolution, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>and I may even have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/atlantis/#Scotch-Irish">Scotch-Irish</a> blood in me</em></strong></span>.
 He is still working as of this writing. Before I continue, it is 
perhaps best that you watch this entire opening scene for yourself, so 
that you might better appreciate what I bring to the table. The scene 
ends at precisely 5:55 when Marty McFly (MM as discussed on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> page) hangs up the phone.</p>

</div></figure><p>I am about to show you how this same opening scene of <em>Back to the Future</em>
 is making multiple references to the bankers (other than the reference 
to “bankruptcy” in the newspaper article). So what do the bankers have 
to do with the founding of Rome? This is the question.</p>
<div class="impact-72">Long before I discovered the corroborating evidence discussed in the remainder of this section, it has been my contention that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the bankers began life as the Roman elite</span>.</div>
<p>Now I have an ever increasing amount of evidence that the Ћinkers are saying the same thing, including my <em>Line V</em> from Google Earth. But first let’s look at the use of 43 and 322 in this opening scene from <em>Back to the Future</em>.</p>

<p>I thought the spacing in “Bankrupt Inventor Sells Off 435 Prime Acres” was suspicious, as was mentioning <em>43</em> and <em>prime</em> in the same breath. So I counted the letters and spaces. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>There are 43. </em></strong></span>But this is not the only use of 43. As the scene opens all you see is traditional dial clocks (sometimes referred to as <em>analog</em>
 clocks) with hour and minute hands. So, you cannot be sure exactly what
 time it is until the image shown here appears at 0:43 seconds. But the 
dead giveaway associating the 753 BC founding of Rome with the bankers 
of today is 03:22. Let me play that part of the opening scene again for 
your convenience.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><br></em></strong></span></p>

<div class="intro">Other banker intrigues</div>
<p>The only legible date on the newspaper articles is August 4, 1962. That is the day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marylin Monroe</a> was murdered by someone who had far worse plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/jfk/">JFK</a>
 than a sexual scandal involving the most classic dumb blonde of all 
time. He was brutally murdered the next year on November 22, 1963, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the same date Denver, Colorado was founded</em></strong></span>. <em>This in and of itself is an indictment of the bankers in the death of Marylin Monroe</em>, something I did not even know until studying this movie.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">A timely soliloquy</div>
<p>And now I am going to say something I have never said before. It is a
 critical observation for understanding what is happening on this 
website. I have always known ever since the discussion at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/#William_Tapley_the_Catholic_lunatic"><em>William Tapley, the Catholic lunatic</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>,
 that the Ћinkers are using the Internet to seed thought. I did not 
discover the 322 banker signature on the design of the World Trade 
Center discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#The_World_Trade_Center_was_designed_and_built_to_be_destroyed"><em>The World Trade Center was designed and built to be destroyed</em></a>.
 I found a less complete discussion of it on an obscure website that 
disappeared sometime after I ran with the story. I used to faithfully 
attribute that website, linking to it long after it went dead. But then 
my browser reported that the URL was not safe. So I had to stop the 
attribution to protect my readers. Now that the Ћinkers have sufficient 
proof that “no one knows where this website is headed but me” (by which I
 mean I work in a peculiar fashion and what looks really bad at first 
takes form as my thought progresses) and that I am capable of polishing 
this work over time so that the Bard would not be so ashamed of me, they
 have a distinct mechanism for reaching out to me. Every night I watch 
YouTubes before going to sleep. One of them two nights ago as of this 
writing was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNFZHBfZ6Kk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Savannah Masons</em></a>, which has a runtime of <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span></strong>:0<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>5</strong></span></em>
 which I will be reporting on below. They may not like it, but as I have
 unapologetically reported in my first TOP video for this homepage, I am
 assuming the mantle of Joel 2:28-30 and Acts 2:17, not because I am 
special but because of of what is said in Bible verses such as 1 
Corinthians 1:19, 26-27.</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Joel 2:28-30</strong><br>And it shall come to pass afterward,
 that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your 
daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young 
men shall see visions: and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids
 in those days will I pour out my spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Acts 2:17</strong><br>And it shall come to pass in the last 
days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your 
sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see 
visions, and your old men shall dream dreams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point is not to make me into a saint. I hid from the world most 
of my life, and for that I am perhaps the greatest sinner. What I am 
trying to tell the reader is that the Ћinkers have direct access to me. 
Anything they want me to know just needs to be added to my YouTube 
recommendations. As for the bankers, they are the masters of this world.
 And if I get in their way, I will die. That is the world in which we 
live. But I fear no man. I have no love for this world and the thought 
of departing it doesn’t concern me. The very fabric of the universe is 
crying out that I do what I am doing, and so I shall until the end.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">This section discusses what I consider to be the single most important scene in the all-important Tomorrowland movie <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>because
 it confirms that what we are facing is an Earth crustal displacement in

 When I saw that the scene ended at exactly 11:00 minutes as Frank 
Walker is passing through the elevator door into the blinding light of 
Tomorrowland for the first time, I immediately sensed that this was a 
reference to the Twin Towers and what happened on September 11, 2001. I 
know from a number of experiences that scene duration is used by the 
Ћinkers to convey meaning. So I checked and found that the scene 
duration was exactly 3:22 minutes. Other references to banker numbers 
would follow.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The three second filler</div>
<p>Given the importance of this scene, I want to show you precisely how I
 arrived at its duration of 3:22 minutes. To do this, you must become an
 Amazon Prime member and buy the movie. Then you can watch it in your 
browser, which is exactly how I work. The previous scene in which Athena
 and Frank Walker are sitting on a bench at the 1964 World’s Fair ends 
at 7:35. The intensity of the music at that end of that scene makes it 
clear that it is not to be divided. However, before the next long 
duration scene begins, for three seconds from 7:36 to 7:38, there is an 
entirely separate scene in which I have tirelessly searched for any sign
 of Frank Walker. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>He’s nowhere to be found.</em></strong></span> <em>Trust me.</em>
 This three seconds of footage is so strange in terms of someone who 
knows to look for scene duration as a source of meaning in films made by
 the Ћinkers that I have come to regard it as a filler that made it 
possible for the 3:22 scene to end at precisely 11:00 minutes.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The quickening</div>
<p>What I want my reader to realize is that the Ћinkers are about to 
confirm that what we are facing is an Earth crustal displacement. I like
 to throw these video clips at the reader before I explain what is 
happening. I do this because I want the reader to develop this 
analytical muscle for themselves, to experience what I call the 
“quickening” when you see things for the first time with me spelling out
 what is happeneing. <em>The 3:22 minutes is real.</em> It combines with the the 11:00 minute end time to send a message which can only be interpreted one way. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The
 banker numbers are in this scene to elevate its importance and to send 
the message, “This is what they are know. This is what they are hiding.”</strong></span><br></em></p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span>:<span style="color: #ff0000;">22</span> scene</div>


<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div id="v-aL00MxhP-1" class="video-player"><iframe width="1350" height="686" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640if_/https://videopress.com/embed/aL00MxhP?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-ruffle-polyfilled=""></iframe><script src="The%20ancients%20are%20screaming%20at%20us...%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
</div></figure><p>So the scene really does start at 7:39 and ends at 
exactly 11:00 as Frank Walker exists the strange interdimensional 
elevator between the 1964 World’s Fair and “Tomorrow.” Now let’s look at
 the Ћinkers numerical signature on this scene. From the time Frank 
Walker jumps the line until he enters “It’s a small world” (back to this
 Disney attraction and it’s theme song in a moment), there is one thing 
and one thing only happening. The Ћinkers are signing a very important 
piece of their work. In this entire scene, there are only three times 
you can clearly see all five of the bumpers on with end of the 
watercraft. There are five such bumpers, and they are being use to 
numerically sign this <em>“Entrance to Tomorrowland”</em> scene, as I am calling it.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are five seats in these watercraft. Each has 
five bumpers in the front and back, so each watercraft carries the 555 
signature. The fact is that once you recognize the importance of this 
scene and then look for the Ћinkers signatures (which is generally how 
this works for me), this “Entrance to Tomorrowland” scene is screaming 
fives everywhere. We were prepared for this in the previous scene which 
was a little more obvious reference to 55. As intriguing as was the 
discovery of the 3:22 scene is, when I would the film back to study the 
previous scene, it really took me to school. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The 322 scene makes it obvious that scene duration is in play in Tomorrowland.</em></span></strong>
 So, knowing that the previous scene is speaking two fives through the 
Athena character, I fully expected the scene duration to be relevant.</p>
<p>It wasn’t. At least not at first. The scene lasts 1:17 minutes. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I knew that couldn’t be right, so I wondered what would happen if I removed the flashback to Frank Walker’s father.</em></strong></span>
 Well that resulted is a 1:01 minute scene and right about the time I 
was thinking maybe I am wrong about this, I noticed Frank Walker’s 
outstretched hand. I thought, “There’s the third five. This is another 
555 scene.” And then I noticed something that just put a huge grin on my
 face. With the flashback cut out, Frank Walkers hand begins to 
outstretch at precisely 55 seconds. The “5 O’clock” and “where the five 
is” comments by Athena were a 55 after all. The outstretched hand at 55 
seconds into the scene is a separate 555. The Ћinkers buried this 555 
for a very specific reason. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They are emphasizing the importance of what they are about to say.</em> </strong></span>And
 what they are about to say is that between normal life and “Tomorrow” 
is a megatsunami wave, one I fear my readers will be seeing for real in 
the not too distant future. The only question is will you be looking up 
or down at it.</p>

</div></figure><p>There is one more part of the scene that we must look 
at before discussing its significance. This is when Frank Walker is in 
the elevator that takes him to “Tomorrow.” The five hard hats confused 
me for a very long time, more than a year. Why are there only five. 
There is no other discernible references to five anywhere else in the 
elevator. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Yet there were eight people in the watercraft ahead of little Frank Walker, and they too were going to Tomorrowland.</em></strong></span>
 So the choice of only five hardhats was begging for an explanation. The
 best I could do was to point out that Frank Walker jumps up at the 
hardhats screaming “Wait!” three times and suggest that the five 
hardhats and the three times “Wait!” is shouted combined to be a 
reference to the number 53 or Sir Francis Bacon. But I was never 
comfortable with that and never did write it. Then one day it occurred 
to me to check the simple English gematria value of the word <em>wait</em>, which is 23 + 1 + 9 + 20 = 53. <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you see the five hardhats plus “Wait! Wait! Wait!” really is a reference to Sir Francis Bacon.</span> </em></strong><em>For
 me, the inference is clearly that we owe a debt of gratitude to the 
Bard for what we are about to learn (hence the hardhats). </em>This is yet another confirmation that this scene is of immense importance. </p>

</div></figure><p>This boat ride into darkness is a parable for what is 
about to happen to mankind. At one end is normal everyday life (the kid 
with the cute little green hat seeking his mother’s approval). At the 
other end is Tomorrowland in which mankind has survived one of these 
planetary catastrophes with technology far in advance of what the public
 knows is available, including free energy and quite possibly 
anti-gravity propulsion, a paradise on Earth where religion will be a 
thing of the past and mankind will know peace and harmony for the first 
time in millennia.</p>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">What is in-between?</div>
<p>What do the bankers know? What’s the big secret in Denver, Colorado? 
Well, let’s image that the diversion of the watercraft headed for 
Tomorrowland mirrors what will happen to the 144,000 after landing at 
Denver International Airport and boarding the Automated Guideway Transit
 System (AGTS). I discuss the highly unusual railroad junctions that can
 be seen when riding the AGTS in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/#The_Automated_Guideway_Transit_System_AGTS_at_the_Denver_International_Airport_is_connected_to_the_Front_Range"><em>The Automated Guideway Transit System (AGTS) at the Denver International Airport is connected to the Front Range</em></a>. In this analogy which the <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 movie is providing, the elevator is the multi-trillion-dollar tunnel 
system and the windows slamming closed is the huge, airtight steel doors
 closing. When Frank Walker emerges from the elevator to a blinding 
light, that is the 144,000 resurfacing after the coming Earth crustal 
displacement (and whatever the bankers are going to do to rid the 
surface of the planet of any survivors).</p>

<p>What happens after the diversion of the watercraft when little Frank 
Walker is plunged into darkness is the reality you and I will experience
 on the surface of the planet. What I am about to show you begins are 
precisely 9:00 minutes into the movie when the camera changes to a 
bird’s eye view of Frank Walker in the watercraft. It lasts exactly nine
 seconds to 9:09. That’s a lot of nines, and nine is the most sacred of 
all sacred numbers. It normally indicates command and control. In this 
case, I think it just means this information is coming from the top. I 
have isolated the wave for your convenience. I did this for a reason. I 
want you to pay careful attention to how much care was taken in filming 
the megatsunami wave which in real life will be two to three miles high 
when it hits the West Coast. This was what first caught my attention 
years ago. I knew what it meant immediately, but fully analyzing the 
scene has taken years. This stuff is not intended for us. You are not 
supposed to know what I am telling you. Depending on where you are in 
your pursuit of this knowledge, you will either dismiss it or it will 
capture your thought as it did mine the first time I saw it. I have no 
doubt whatsoever that my interpretation of this scene is correct. If you
 stay with me, if you give your mind time enough to take it all in, I 
can assure you that you too will eventually see this scene as it was 
intended to be sees <em>by the “initiated,”</em> those people who know 
the original Rosicrucians and Freemasons were tasked with keeping the 
torch of Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers lit for the last 
generation, to give us at least a chance of knowing ahead of time. This 
is your chance. <em>Right now.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Open your eyes! Know how difficult it was to film this wave on both sides and why it fills the entire screen.&nbsp;</em> </strong></span></p>

</div></figure><p>The 3:22 minute duration of this “Entrance to 
Tomorrowland” scene reminds me of the Washington Monument. Only in this 
case the Ћinkers are explaining to you what the bankers know, not just 
saying, “We will expose them.” And what they know is that a really big 
wave is coming. I am fascinated by the great care taken in the filming 
of this downsized megatsunami wave. It is what separates the “World’s 
Fair” from “Tomorrow.” After the wave, there is darkness and silence. 
But then we find ourselves in the promised,— <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>technologically advanced</em></strong></span>—<em>Tomorrowland</em>.</p>

<div class="impact-72-red">The 1964 World’s Fair was preparation for the making of Tomorrowland.</div>
<p>Let me say this again for effect. The concept of the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie existed well before the 1964 World’s Fair was ever built. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is one thing.</em></strong></span>
 You need to see history from the eyes of the men who are making it. 
Time is not the same for them. And so I want to discuss the lyrics for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/http://All%20of%20the%20banker%20numbers%20in%20this%203:22%20minute%20%22Entrance%20to%20Tomorrowland%22%20scene%20reminds%20me%20of%20the%20Washington%20Monument.%20Only%20in%20this%20case%20the%20%D0%8Binkers%20are%20explaining%20to%20you%20what%20the%20bankers%20know,%20not%20just%20saying,%20%22We%20will%20expose%20them.%22%20And%20what%20they%20know%20is%20that%20a%20really%20big%20wave%20is%20coming.%20I%20am%20fascinated%20by%20the%20great%20care%20taken%20in%20the%20filming%20of%20this%20downsized%20megatsunami%20wave.%20It%20is%20what%20separates%20the%20%22World's%20Fair%22%20from%20%22Tomorrow.%22%20After%20the%20wave,%20there%20is%20darkness%20and%20silence.%20But%20then%20we%20find%20ourselves%20in%20the%20promised,%E2%80%94%20technologically%20advanced%E2%80%94Tomorrowland." data-wplink-url-error="true"><em>it’s a small world</em></a>, which was written in 1963.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="wp-h1">History, After All</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>“it’s a small world” was created for the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair.</em></strong></span>
 Personally overseen by Walt Disney in support of the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the attraction was a huge hit. After 2 seasons
 there, it was shipped to Disneyland park, where it opened on May 28, 
1966.</p>
<p>In 1971, “it’s a small world” was recreated to become one of the 
Opening Day attractions at Walt Disney World Resort. Due to its immense 
popularity, the attraction has been replicated at many Disney theme 
parks around the world and is considered a Walt Disney masterpiece.</p>
<p class="wp-h1">The Story Behind the Song</p>
<p>“It’s a Small World (After All)” is a timeless classic and one of the
 most well-known songs of all time. Walt Disney asked the Academy 
Award®-winning brothers, Richard and Robert Sherman, who were hard at 
work on&nbsp;Mary Poppins, to create a single song that could be sung by
 Audio-Animatronics figures in multiple languages.</p>
<p class="citation">Disneyworld, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/its-a-small-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>it’s a small world</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect these lyrics contain a very different message than the one heard by the masses.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 25%;">
<p>It’s a world of laughter, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>a world of tears</em></strong></span><br>It’s a world of hopes and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>a world of fears</strong></em></span><br>There’s so much that we share<br>That it’s time we’re aware<br>It’s a small world after all</p>
<p>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small, small world</p>
<p>There is just one moon and one golden sun<br>And a smile means friendship to everyone<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Though the mountains divide</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And the oceans are wide</em></strong></span><br>It’s a small world after all</p>
<p>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small world after all<br>It’s a small, small world.</p>
</div>
<p>The rhyming element in the first two lines is <em>ears</em>, which 
has a simple English gematria of 5 + 1 + 18 + 19 = 43.&nbsp; “Though the
 mountains divide” seems to echo biblical verses about mountains 
crumbling in the end time. And the “oceans are wide” reminds me of 
Virgil’s “See how it totters- the world’s orbed might, Earth, and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>wide ocean</em></strong></span>.”
 I just can’t shake the feeling that the meaning here is more at “It’s 
[going to be] a small world after all [the people die].”</p>
<p>The only evidence I can find for this is the simple English gematria 
value of “it’s a small world after all” and a video clip from, of all 
places, Tomorrowland. I’m saving the video clip to last because it is 
the proof of what I am telling you. </p>

 seen this before but dismissed it. I will not do so again. I’ve added 
253 to my numbers dictionary, which means I am now tracking it’s use. 
The meaning here is “to 53” as in “dedicated <em>to</em> Sir Francis Bacon.” <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This
 use of the number 53 to reference Sir Francis Bacon,—the founder of the
 original Rosicrucians and by extension the Freemasons,—dates back to 
the First Folio and is discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a></em></strong></span>.
 In other words, Walt Disney is an integral part of what I am calling 
the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings, and he is a devoted 33° 
Freemason <em>who knows everything</em>.

 I would go as far as to say that Walt Disney was the most important 
Ћinker (at least from a historical perspective) since George Washington.</p>
<p>His marching orders for the Sherman brothers (how apropos given that 
Sherman is the one who burned Atlanta) was “to create a single song that
 could be sung by Audio-Animatronics figures in multiple languages.” 
This little end-time ditty is reputed to be “the single most performed 
and most widely translated song on earth,” and Walt Disney dedicated it 
to his leader, the man you know of as William Shakespeare.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="wp-h2">History</p>
<hr class="wp-hr"><p>“Children of the World” was the working title of 
the attraction Walt Disney only called “the happiest cruise that ever 
sailed” (and never “It’s a Small World”). The attraction’s tentative 
soundtrack design featured each national anthem, playing all at once, 
which resulted in a cacophonous noise. Walt demonstrated the miniature 
mock-up to his staff songwriters Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. 
Sherman. As he and the Sherman Brothers walked through Walt said, “I 
need one song.” A single song for the attraction which could be easily 
translated into many different languages and which could be played in 
all round. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Sherman 
Brothers wrote “it’s a small world (after all)” in the wake of the Cuban
 Missile Crisis, which influenced the song’s message.</em></strong></span>
 They first presented “it’s a small world (after all)” to Walt by 
singing in counterpoint while walking through the mock-up. In the spirit
 of international unity, “it’s a small world (after all)” was sung and 
recorded in various studios around the world – by a church choir in 
London, TV performers in Mexico City, a school chorus in Rome, and by 
local children from Tokyo and California.</p>
<p>It is argued that this song is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the single most performed and most widely translated song on earth</em></strong></span>.
 The song’s tune and lyrics are the only Disney creations never to be 
copyrighted, as UNICEF requested, and can be heard worldwide on musical 
devices ranging from keyboard demos to ice cream trucks, it remains “a 
gift to the children of the world.”</p>
<p class="citation">
</p></blockquote>
<p>I will begin tracking the number 253 and in time will demonstrate 
that it is used the same as 53, as a reference to Sir Francis Bacon. Now
 that I have told you the truth about this little end-time ditty, let me
 show you the proof of what I am saying. It is in the following video 
clip from <em>Tomorrowland</em>. Listen for “it’s a small world” eerily playing in the background. Listen carefully to <em>how</em> it is played. This is the scene in which we are shown <em>Tomorrowland</em> as the bankers imagine it will be. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>But
 the haunting sound of “it’s a small world” playing in the background is
 an unmistakable reminder that over seven billion people must die in 
order to get there.</em></span></strong> </p>

<div class="intro">Other 55 and 555 in Tomorrowland</div>
<p>It may come as a surprise to the reader, but I never came even remotely close to finishing my analysis of the <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 movie. I am quite sure much remains to be discovered. I haven’t even 
watched the “Extended Version” material, which donors assure me is more 
than meets the eye. As additional uses of 55 and 555 come to light in 
the Tomorrowland movie, I will add then here or in one of the following 
subsections.</p>
<p>In the ST-3929-Just_A_Dream_Away.mp3 recording discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">№ 22.

 not making this stuff up. You can take the blue bill and tell yourself 
that, but I would suggest that if you think this is a figment of my 
imagination that you just have not developed the ability to interpret 
the symbolic language used in films made by the Ћinkers. It’s amazingly 
consistent from one movie to the next. What keeps the average reader 
from accepting such analysis is the <em>Everything is one thing</em> perspective on the world, which I discuss in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/website/#The_five_fundamental_principles_of_An_Apocalyptic_Synthesis"><em>The five fundamental principles of An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em></a>.

<p class="first-paragraph">This section, whose date I would add can be expressed as 108, will forever mark the day on which I discovered the end date, <em>at least according to the Ћinkers</em>.
 As many of my readers know, I began this quest for knowledge a decade 
ago with the intent of writing a book about what happened in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/scofield/">3100 BC</a>.
 But along the way I learned about the planet’s catastrophic past and 
that this knowledge was being suppressed at a very high level, 
indicating the existence of a powerful organization in the formative 
years of The United States of America whose sole intent was not only to 
hide our planet’s catastrophic past but to replace it with the opposite 
lie of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/matrix/#Uniformitarianism_or_gradualism_is_the_biggest_lie_of_all_time_and_designed_to_lull_the_masses_to_sleep">uniformitarianism (or gradualism)</a>. I write about this on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/matrix/">№ 1. Our entirely fabricated reality</a>.
 I was very angry at the time. Why was this information being hidden 
from us? The answer became obvious over time. Not only was the planet 
subject to cyclic destruction, but one of these planetary catastrophes 
was about to happen again—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>in my lifetime</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s something you need to know about me. I walked away from a
 very successful career in computer programming because I had abstracted
 the work to the point that it didn’t matter what problem was presented 
to me. In my mind it was all a big circle, like a hamster running on a 
treadmill. I didn’t want to keep doing the same thing over and over 
again the rest of my life for the sake of money. So I closed my eyes, 
metaphorically speaking, and leapt off the cliff of “Where is my life 
headed?”. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>My mind graves a challenge</em></strong></span>, and nothing has ever satisfied me until I determined to know the <em>what</em> and the <em>when</em> of the coming apocalypse.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Angles and Angels</div>
<p>A group of men I call the Ћinkers had gone before me. If ever an 
angel walked the face of this Earth, it was one of the Freemasons of the
 South who—after suffering a humiliating defeat in the so-called Civil 
War <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>when The United States of America was conquered by the Old World Bankers</em></strong></span>,
—kept this knowledge alive and fulfilled their mission appointed to them
 by no less than your William Shakespeare. I have said it before, and I 
will say it again. As God is my witness, I would not hesitate to follow 
these men into battle and would consider it an honor to die for their 
cause. No finer men have ever existed than this handful of families in 
and around Atlanta, Georgia. I salute them. My path was made relatively 
easy because of their work. The <em>what</em> came to me as I was 
crossing over a high mountain pass in Ecuador. It was like a light 
shinning down from the heavens. I kid you not. <em>I remember exactly such a physical sensation.</em>
 It was the kind of moment highly abstract thinkers live for when 
everything comes together at multiple levels. In the end, to make it 
palatable for the masses, I reduced it to a simple argument the that 
movie <em>2012</em> followed by the details of how the <em>Adam and Eve Story</em>
 was declassified is the Ћinkers telling us that the coming planetary 
catastrophe is an Earth crustal displacement. For me at least, it helped
 that this was in complete concord with the Nazarene’s advice to “flee 
into the mountains” (clearly indicating a water event).&nbsp; But the <em>when</em>
 continued to elude me. At one point I reconciled myself to the reality 
that I would never know the date with any certainty. My focus was on 
discovering the year. And I began to doubt if there was a specific date 
despite what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/classical-eschatology/#Berossus_Caldeus_and_the_final_catastrophe">Seneca the Younger</a> says or the <em>“Exact Date”</em> scene in <em>Tomorrowland</em>.</p>
<p>In as much as I trust the Ћinkers not to create such an elaborate ruse with the sole intent of misdirecting us, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>as of this date my quest to know the what and when of the coming apocalypse has come to an end</em></strong></span>.</p>
<div class="impact-108">There is going to be an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Earth crustal displacement</span> on or around <span style="color: #ff0000;">December 21, 2022</span>.</div>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The date</div>
<p>Now let us begin to delve into the details of how I arrived at this date. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I
 warn the reader, you must read all of the above sections about the 
number 55 and 555 to appreciate what is said in this section.</em></strong></span> Indeed, it was while writing those sections in a very inspired state of mind that I learned the date.</p>
<p>I am losing count of how many times we are presented with the idea of two fives in <em>Tomorrowland</em> and elsewhere. The reason for this seems painfully obvious to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact, sans-serif; font-size: 72px;">2012 + 5 years = <span style="color: #ff0000;">2017</span></span></p>
<p>Thanks to David Montaigne, we now know this date is everything I say it is on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is Revelation 12:1-2</span>.</em> And the implications of this are truly world shattering. <em>This date must be at the center of any thinking about the year the progeny of Jove are projecting in the Tomorrowland movie.</em> Now for the other five.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact, sans-serif; font-size: 72px;">2017 + 5 years = <span style="color: #ff0000;">2022</span></span></p>
<p>In this section I will begin to collect all the times the Ћinkers are
 throwing the two fives, the number 25, or February 5 in our face. Allow
 me to apologize to non-religious readers in advance of what I am about 
to say, and at the same time remind them that I am utterly convinced <em>The Revelation</em> was commissioned by the Roman elite for reasons discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>.
 With that said, I have come to believe that these two periods of five 
years are the same “ten days” to which Revelation 2:10 refers.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Revelation 2:10</strong><br>Fear none of those things which 
thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison,
 that ye may be tried; and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ye shall have tribulation ten days</span></strong>: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>

They bought the <em>Book of Daniel</em> and <em>The Revelation</em>
 hook, line, and sinker and are paying a heavy price for such 
intellectual sloth. These men are living under the Roman elite. They can
 easily imagine what it will be like living under the same banker 
mentality so close to the end. I don’t like to say it because, at this 
point in my earthly experience, I live by the grace of God <em>and</em> 
the grace of the bankers. My mortal flesh is easily wounded. But these 
men are on the whole psychopaths and must of necessity be suffering from
 some measure of inbreeding. Yet, they are our best hope for surviving 
the coming Earth crustal displacement without rebooting as cavemen and 
finally getting off this planet. So perhaps Mother nature is more cruel 
than our imaginations will allow us to believe and—whatever the genetic 
defect that explains the banker’s lack of empathy for his fellow human 
beings—they represent the biological future of mankind. Perhaps such men
 are needed to protect our species once we leave this planet. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Who am I to say?</em></strong></span>
 I live for small donations so that I can keep going. These men are in 
control of the entire Western World as well as the end-time 
infrastructure in and around Denver, Colorado. Those are the facts.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The real tribulation</div>
<p>So what are the writers of <em>The Revelation</em> talking about? 
They’re talking about the bloodbath history incorrectly remembers as a 
“Civil” war. They’re talking about the Federal Reserve System and taking
 us off the Gold standard. They’re talking about endless wars that make 
no sense. They’re talking about the Apollo program and JFK. They’re 
talking about providing military gear to civilian police forces and the 
widespread use of steroids by police officers,—both of which have 
resulted in the police state in which we now live. They’re talking about
 CIA involvement in drugs and the cocaine epidemic in the 1980s that 
funded the completion of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system</a> in the Front Range.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<p></p>
<div class="intro">The last ten years</div>
<p>In the time frame of December 21, 2012 to December 21, 2022, they’re 
talking about 9/11 and the deadly aftermath in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
They’re talking about our wholesale loss of privacy and of basic 
constitutional rights. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>COVID-19 is an engineered, “Made in America” virus.</em></strong></span>
 That’s what they are talking about. I could go on, but the point is 
that they know the Roman elite or banker mentality is going to get much 
worse and totally out of control in the end. I reiterate my heartfelt 
objection to the popular concept of <em>prophesy</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The writers of The Revelation are Ћinkers.</em></strong></span>
 There is no big guy in the sky telling them about the future. They are 
observing the Roman elite and projecting their behavior into the future 
knowing that December 21, 2012 (the end of 13 baktuns in the Maya Long 
Count) is going to be used as the world’s greatest Crying Wolf incident.
 And they are predicting that things are going to get much worse after 
that. And guess what? They were right. We just don’t realize how bad it 
is because we are like the boiling frog. We started as corporate slaves,
 exactly, I might add, as Mary Baker Eddy predicted. Then they started 
sending our children overseas to die and be maimed for life in senseless
 wars. Now we’re walking around with these fucking masks on our face and
 being injected with God knows what. What’s next? Don’t ask, because you
 don’t want to know the answer. The men who wrote <em>The Revelation</em>
 for the Roman elite were not playing games. This is all very real. In 
case you haven’t noticed, people are dying by the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Revelation 2:10 is about the tribulation, but this is not the same as the nonsense that grows out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/"><em>Book of Daniel</em></a>,
 which I remain convinced is misdirection intended to result in the very
 same Christian insanity so prevalent in our society today—after a 
hundred plus years of would-be saviors beating their heads against a 
wall trying to figure out something deliberately nonsensical and 
intended to confuse those who would attempt to decipher its meaning, not
 knowing Daniel never existed and that this book was written by the 
progeny of Jove. Unlike the quagmire in Daniel 12:11-12, there is only 
one number associated with the word <em>tribulation</em> in Revelation 2:10. And it is meaningful, as I will show in this section.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Two fives, 25, and February 5</div>
<p>What I am now going to show is a series of references to two fives 
(as distinct from the number 55) which are sometimes expressed as the 
number 25 (as in the crescendo of the opening 5:55 minute scene in <em>Back to the Future</em>),
 and even February 5. Everything you have read in all of the 55 and 555 
sections above has been preparation for this discussion of two fives, 
25, or February 5. I can no longer ignore what is happening here. 
Indeed, paying heed to these thoughts that have cried out for my 
attention over the past couple of years has led to the discovery of the 
Ћinkers’ end date. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>As of this writing, I suspect the underlying message of signing everything from the Washington Monument to</strong>
 Back to the Future with the number 55 is a reference to two periods of 
five years that began with the planned deception of December 21, 2012, 
and ends on December 21, 2022.</em></span> The date that comes between is September 23, 2017, which is discussed at great length on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>. I am now certain of the December 21, 2022 end date for a growing number of reasons.</p>
<ul><li>The Nazarene said “pray that your flight be not in winter,” 
which I think was a brilliantly simple way of telling us that this is a 
winter event</li>
<li>It would make sense for the bankers to Cry Wolf on December 21, 
2012, if this is the time of year the Earth crustal displacement occurs</li>
<li>An image found in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNFZHBfZ6Kk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Savannah Masons</a> video, which is shown below</li>
<li>I am hesitant to add this because all of the other bulleted items in
 this list strike a deep chord in me, but the release date for the new 
Matrix 4 movie of December 22, 2021 has caught my attention in this 
context because it can be rearranged to read December 21, 2022. I can 
think of no other reason for releasing the movie the day after the 
Winter Solstice. It reminds me of the actual Maya Long Count end date of
 December 16, 2013. That too carried a profound meaning, one I discuss 
in this section. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>I have always thought of the</strong> Wachowskis as renegade progeny of Jove answering to no one.</em></span>
 The Matrix comes closer to conveying the reality of what is happening 
than anything else in art and literature. I greatly admire their 
work.&nbsp;</li>
<li>But most of all, the date I have identified as the start of the 
“fireworks finale” of end-time warnings here on this homepage is 
December 21, 1979, the release date for the appropriately named <em>The Black Hole</em> movie. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is precisely 43 years before December 21, 2022.</em></strong></span>
 Do you see now why in the end I dedicated my homepage to an elaborate 
discussion of the numbers 322 and 43? The progeny of Jove speak in 
numbers. 322 and 43 are “bankers numbers” related to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#Vox_in_excelso_A_voice_from_on_high">Vox in excelso</a> as are the 66 and 666 they planted in <em>The Revelation</em>, but when used by the Ћinkers these numbers always mean, <em>“This is what they know. This is what the bankers are hiding from you.”</em>
 So this 43 years is telling us the end date not just as presented by 
the Ћinkers; this is the end date as believed by all of the progeny of 
Jove. I regard this 43 years as the nail in the coffin of when the Earth
 crustal displacement is expected to happen according to the progeny of 
Jove. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Ћinkers would not construct something this elaborate just to tell a lie.</em></strong></span>
 That is not even remotely in their character. And speaking of lies, 
when I said “Are you fucking kidding me” in my first TOP video at the 
top of this homepage, I was telling a lie. I guess you really can 
discover the end date just by surfing the Internet. Please note also 
that in this context, the five year “course correction” in <em>Tomorrowland</em> and <em>The Black Hole</em> is the second of these five year time periods from September 23, 2017 to December 21, 2022.</li>
</ul><div class="impact-216-red" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">43 Years</div>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">before the end</div>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Proving the 13,067 day 
duration of the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings discussed in the
 next section is now of incalculable importance to me because this 43

<div class="intro">My plan</div>
<p>The reader may think announcing the end date for the Fifth World would be a big deal in the life of a writer, <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">but it pales in significance to what I will be doing next. Why? What can be more important than the end date?</span>&nbsp; </em></strong>When
 I started down this path, I prayed God to let me know everything the 
progeny of Jove have ever done so that they might understand there is a 
conscious entity behind the sacred numbers. <em>My plan was to divulge 
everything they have ever done, knowing that they would check behind the
 scenes to see who was helping me.</em> What they would discover is that no one is helping me. Then how could I know everything they have ever done? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Metaphysics.</em></strong></span>
 There is only one Mind. I would appeal to it for help. Pythagoras was 
wrong when he said “All is number.” The Ћinkers know this. They are God 
fearing men and would never lay a finger on me. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is the bankers to whom I speak.</em></strong></span>
 They may be our future, and doing this was perhaps the most productive 
thing I could do with the time left to me. If they survive, somewhere in
 the dark recesses of their thought a few of them would always wonder 
how I could have known so much. Maybe that would give them pause, 
thereby cast some small part of me into the next world like skipping a 
stone on water,—even if I do not survive. One’s struggle should always 
be how to make the most of your life. This was my answer.</p>
<p>I am the right person for the job because I understand how the bankers think. <em>I read about what happened to them in France.</em>
 And so I am in sympathy with their cause to the point that I understand
 the meaning of 322 and 43 more so than perhaps even some of them do<em>—
because I have been hated my whole life, including by my family and 
coreligionists, beaten to a pulp countless times (I estimate over 300 
fights before I graduated from high school) and for no other reason than
 who and what I am, and betrayed by those closest to me, over and over 
and over again</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I do not love this world either</em><em>.</em></strong></span> I too long to see it destroyed. It has been apparent to me for at least half of my time on this dreary planet that <em>fixing what is wrong is not possible</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>“Destruction is the only way forward”</em></strong></span>
 is my motto. Everything bothers me. Why can’t the poor people in The 
United States of America get decent dental care? What insanity is that? 
Only I did not let all of this turn me into a monster. I tell you of a 
truth, gentlemen, there will be a reckoning for what you did to the 
children. ET will not stand idly by and watch you take control of this 
planet. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is not how the story ends.</em></strong></span></p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Destiny fulfilled</div>
<p>While I will continue to write until the end, proving that my 13,067 
day duration of the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings is a precise
 measurement has come to represent for me the crowning achievement of my
 lifetime. I am about to rewrite my discussion of the 13,067 days from 
the release of <em>The Black Hole</em> to the release of <em>The Walk</em>
 in the next section. And when I do, life is never going to be the same 
for me again. I will no longer need to prove anything to anybody. I know
 this already and have put the Ћinkers on notice that no one stands 
between me and the Bard. I do not know yet exactly what will change. I 
just know that having achieved my seemingly impossible goal, something 
is going to change. I can feel it. For weeks now I have pushed myself 
relentlessly towards this goal. The work has been so inspired I am in 
awe of what is happening.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Obstacles</div>
<p>It has not been an easy path for me. Obstacles were put in my way to 
hinder my progress or prove me something other than what I claim. Let me
 say this again so that all the <em>players</em> hear me. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Obstacles were put in my way.</em></strong></span>
 I heard my name spoken. I knew exactly what you were doing. And to be 
even more precise, I accept your fucking apology as long as you see I do
 not conform to anyone’s expectation. That is my secret in life. I am 
fluid. Sir Francis Bacon’s most profound truth is that nothing is good 
or bad <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>but thinking makes it so</em></strong></span>. I was thinking. You never got past my thinker. I knew where I was at all times. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Mind or matter, that is the question.</em></strong></span> Which is it? Both cannot be true. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The future of mankind is not your technology. It is metaphysics and ET knows this.</em></strong></span>
 I have come to believe they are working on an entirely different 
solution to our problem of insufficient time between planetary 
catastrophes to develop anti-gravity propulsion systems and escape this 
defective Solar System. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>You boys are the ones who are out of time.</em></strong></span>
 We are not the walking dead. The same ET race that brought us the 
Nazarene, the “little book,” and who I met in person are not going to 
play ball with you. But what they will do is help us open those vault 
doors and give of access to all of your “technological wonders” which 
are for them little more than children’s toys. My real problem with what
 you did was the failure to recognize that if you had not kept this 
secret and had organized us better, we would have achieved everything 
you are planning for the next world <em>and more</em>. Hundreds of 
thousands could have survived, better preserving our genetic diversity. 
Can you not see that what you are attempting cannot be allowed to 
succeed? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Are you really so blind?</em></strong></span>
 That is why they said hi to me. They knew I would carry this message to
 you. As God is my witness, if I were one of you, I would not enter that
 cave. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is a death trap.</em> </strong></span></p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">January 1, 2025</div>
<p>One last thing before launching into the details of how I arrived at the December 21, 2022 end date. As everyone knows, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I am not married to dates</em></strong></span>. I know too much about these guys to put my confidence in a date. <em>I
 stand my ground on January 1, 2025 never happening because that is 
rooted in the religion of the progeny of Jove which would of necessity 
dictate the end occur in one of these three years.</em> However, <em>conscious</em>
 dictates that I begin reporting the December 21, 2022 date as what I 
earnestly believe the Ћinkers are projecting as the end date. So let’s 
get to it. This first item is for me the most important, but I fear it 
will escape most readers. My advice is to keep reading. This information
 takes a long time to properly digest. It has taken me years. You do not
 have that luxury.</p>

<p>Someone is going to do this. It might as well be me. The first clock in the opening 5:55 minute scene of <em>Back to the Future</em>
 appears at 0:37 seconds into the movie and of course the time is 7:53. 
The time remains 7:53 at least until 0:52 when the 53 in the image to 
the left is seen for the last time. <em>However, note that because these
 are analog clocks, it is not possible to know precisely where in the 
scene the minute 7:53 comes to an end.</em> The 8:00 AM alarms at the 
end of the scene start ringing at precisely 5:27 minutes. The scene is 
shot in real time. 5:27 – 0:52 = <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>4:35 minutes elapsed</em></strong></span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>However, 8:00 – 7:53 = 7:00 minutes according to the clocks.</em></strong></span> The difference is <em>2:</em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>25</em></strong></span>
 minutes. You can’t really do anything with these numbers because the 
time difference cannot be precisely determined. It is, however, in its 
simplest computation another instance of the number 25,—and not just one
 25, but <em>two 25s</em>,—and I am quite sure that is how it is 
intended as I will show you momentarily. The closing seconds of this 
opening scene is all about the number 25, which is to be read as <em>two fives</em>.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">A cacophony of alarm clocks (a.k.a. a wake-up call)</div>
<p>I fear few of you will see this last part of the 5:55 minute opening scene of <em>Back to the Future</em> as I do, especially if you have not read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/#55_and_555_in_Back_to_the_Future"><em>55 and 555 in Back to the Future</em></a>. If you haven’t, you need to stop and read it right now. This discussion is about 25 of the 28 last seconds in that scene. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>If
 the 5:55 minutes opening scene of Back to the Future were a symphony, 
these 25 seconds would be the crescendo at the end of the final 
movement.</em></strong></span> This part of the scene begins with the 
cacophony of all the alarm clocks sounding 8:00 AM. After a whirlwind 
tour of the history of the Western World from the founding of Rome on 
April 21, 753 BC to the suppression of the Knights Templar on March 22, 
1312 and the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 
2001, these alarm clocks are a sure sign that the best is yet to come. I
 knew that the first time I heard them, but what did it mean? What does 
the 25 minutes Doc is shouting about mean? This is a riddle because at 
no time in this or the other two movies in the trilogy is this 25 minute
 “experiment” ever mentioned again because <em>the experiment is not about time travel</em>. It is all about you understanding the numeric symbolism of the number 25 or <em>two fives</em>.</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">25 minutes in 25 seconds</div>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The answer escaped me until after I knew the Ћinkers end date of December 21, 2022.</em></strong></span>
 Then one day while out on a walk I saw it exactly as I was meant to see
 it. I realized the clocks are “slow” and “I’m late for school” are the 
Ћinkers having fun. After studying them for years, I can assure you 
these guys have a sense of humor. That includes the bankers. The Ћinkers
 know how difficult it is to correctly interpret the end of this opening
 scene. It really is a riddle. They know no one will get it immediately.
 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is the moment in which the change from 55 to two fives takes place.</em></strong></span> After this rather loud confirmation that <em>55 is two fives and not the other way around</em>, you will begin to see what this section is all about. What happens in this 25 seconds reminds me of <em>The Walk</em>.
 There is a certain symbolic elegance, if not beauty, to what is being 
said. Master Po has nothing on the Ћinkers. Being able to understand 
what is really happening in these 25 seconds is more special than words 
can adequately convey. So do I care if you think I am batshit crazy and 
all of this only exists in my head? No. I cannot take you from where you
 are into the light of reality,—that this world is about to abruptly 
end,—if you are not willing. For me, when the meaning of this 25 seconds
 dawned in my consciousness, it was like a small group of some of the 
finest men alive throwing me a surprise party, when I thought I would 
never even get to meet them in this lifetime. Got it? It’s important. <em>Pay attention!</em>
 This last part of the scene begins at 5:27 and of course ends at 5:55. 
Or does it? The last three seconds are Marty McFly saying he is late for
 school and hanging up the phone. So arguable, this part of the scene 
lasts <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>25</em></strong></span> seconds. Here are those 25 seconds.</p>

</div></figure><p>These 25 seconds and Doc’s 25 minutes are both examples of <em>two fives</em>
 as opposed to the number 55. I am about to show you a number of 
references to two fives, 25, or February 5. All of them could be viewed 
as another way of signing their work, but I have come to see it 
differently.</p>
<div class="impact-90" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">55</span> is another way of saying <span style="color: #ff0000;">two fives</span>.</div>
<p>That is my take on what is happening. The Ћinkers chose a numeric 
signature that incorporated knowledge of the end date. Perhaps now you 
can we why the simplicity of 55 and 555 on the Washington Monument makes
 sense? From a degree of difficulty, the Washington Monument puts the 
Georgia Guidestones to shame, but the Georgia Guidestones encodes so 
much information I have written a small book about it.</p>
<div class="impact-90-red">Why does the Washington Monument emphasize 55 to the exclusion of everything else?</div>
<p>55 is multiplied 10 times to arrive at the height of the Washington Monument. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is about 55.</em></strong></span> Why? Well, ask yourself, <em>What is more important than the end date?</em>
 There’s your answer. Two fives are not another way of saying 55; 55 is 
another way of saying two fives. There are two five year periods after 
the end of 13 baktuns in the Maya Long Count. They are separated by the 
“great wonder” of September 23, 2017 as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>.</p>

<div class="intro">Tomorrowland</div>
<p>My donors have been trying to figure out the countdown clock in what I call <em>Tomorrowland’s</em> <em>“Exact Date”</em>
 scene for a very long time. I mention this because they are responding 
to a very primal feeling that there is something profoundly important 
about the countdown clock in a scene asking the question, “If I could 
tell you the date,—<em>the exact date</em>,—you’re gonna die, would you wanna know?” First let’s take another look at the scene.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div id="v-LxQnQwQ9-1" class="video-player"><iframe width="1350" height="640" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640if_/https://videopress.com/embed/LxQnQwQ9?hd=1&amp;cover=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-ruffle-polyfilled=""></iframe><script src="The%20ancients%20are%20screaming%20at%20us...%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div>
</div></figure><p>When it first appears, the value of the countdown clock is 00 00 59 09 <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>23</strong></span></em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>37</em></strong></span>. The runtime is at 1:03:13. We see the countdown clock again four seconds later at 1:03:17 and its value is 00 00 59 09 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>22 56</em></strong></span>.
 An obvious mistake, nes pa? Only four seconds elapsed but the countdown
 clock is showing a difference of 41 seconds. Well, what are mistakes? 
If you know anything about the Ћinkers, you know they don’t make 
mistakes, unless they are trying to catch your attention. And in this 
case, I would say they are using a bullhorn. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What is the 41? It’s Pythagoras Lodge No. 41, the builders of the Georgia Guidestones.</em></strong></span> This is your first hint that something really special is happening. This image is what comes next.</p>

Since the countdown clock from the above <em>Exact Date</em>
 scene so obviously was meant to convey a message, it was very cleverly 
hidden. The numbers displayed on the countdown clock are meant to be 
read as 60 – 59.09.22.55 where the 59 conveys the idea of the last 
second, the 09 as always is a reference to command and control (like the
 nine tail feathers on a one-dollar bill) and in the context of this 
particular countdown clock amounts to an instruction to work hard to 
decipher its meaning, the 22 is yet another reference to the year 2022; 
and 55 is the two periods of five years that must be added to December 
21, 2012. Okay, well we already knew all of that. But something very 
special is happening in this scene. 60 – 59.092255 = .907745 which is 
meant to be added as three numbers 90 + 77 + 45 = 212 or 2012. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>This is a brilliant confirmation that the ten years are to be added to</strong> December 21, 2012.</em></span>
 Or you can subtract 59.092254, which was the last of the three seconds 
shown in this scene, and the difference, when added as three numbers, 
would be 213 or 2013, the year filming of <em>Tomorrowland</em> began. 
Of course, in a scene as critical as this, I am morally obligated to 
point out that the Maya Long Count did not end until December 16, 2013. 
So maybe what that last second means is the Ћinkers signaling that they 
know the correct end date of the Maya Long Count. <em>This is why I will not marry an end date.</em>
 My “January 1, 2025 never happens” is very conservative. Every time 
these guys Cry Wolf, 100,000,000 souls drop out of the game. I don’t 
plan to be one of them. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Their religion dictates that the last year be 2022, 2023, or 2024.</em> </strong><strong><em>They will not violate this.</em></strong></span> But do the Ћinkers believe the end date is December 21, 2022? Yes, I believe they do. The 43 years from the release of <em>The Black Hole</em> on December 21, 1979 to December 21, 2022 convinces me of this. <em>I don’t think these guys Cry Wolf.</em>
 Crying Wolf gets innocent people killed. Only the bankers Cry Wolf. Now
 that I have your attention, let’s take a look at some other two fives 
stuff in <em>Tomorrowland</em>.</p>

<p><em>Do not overlook any detail of this image, including the unusually wide spacing on either side of the<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> two periods</strong></span></em>.</p>
<p>Now look at the image again and ask yourself, “When does this period 
of ten years end? Even the 15 is significant because that is the year in
 which the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings ended. There is a 
certain perfection to this image. Or else I’m batshit crazy.</p>

It’s a WRAP!</a>“</p>
<div class="impact-216-red" style="text-align: center;">It’s a Wrap!</div>
<p>Seriously. Check it out. The date was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>February 5</em></strong></span>, 2014. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Two fives.</em></strong></span> It’s all just a game until it’s not. I’ve said this before. The symbolism in <em>The Walk</em> is intended for people who play this game at my level, which is Royal Arch Freemasons and <em>me</em>. It is too subtle to ever be understood or fully appreciated by the masses. But <em>Tomorrowland</em> with its big wave separating this world from the next in the <em>Entrance to Tomorrowland</em> scene is obviously meant for public consumption. Ergo, <em>Tomorrowland</em> was the last end-time warning for the people. And this is your opportunity to <em>get it</em>. Personally, I thought the “course correction” of five years in <em>The Black Hole</em>
 was in-your-face. I was laying in bed the first time I watched it and 
my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. I was so excited I can still 
remember it as if it were yesterday.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">The Builders</div>
<p>And then there is this YouTube which I am convinced was made for no 
other reason than to emphasize these two periods of five years, not 
unlike what happens at the end of the 5:55 minute opening scene in <em>Back to the Future</em> when all the alarms go off and Doc starts shouting something about 25 years.</p>

 thoughtful person would study this video and take note what images are 
showing at special times such as 0:09, 0:13, 0:33, 0:53, 0:58, 1:06 (66 
seconds), and 1:48 (108 seconds), though I could name others. But of all
 the images paraded in front of us in this 2:05 minute video, that one

The Maya Wayeb is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%CA%BC#5_unlucky_days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five “unlucky” days</a> added to the end of their 365-day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haab%CA%BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haab’</a> calendar. The <em>Great Wayeb</em> is five <em>years</em>, not days, and it is added to the end of the Maya Long Count in order to obfuscate the actual end date.</p>
<p>The reader can but imagine how I felt when I <em>discovered</em> that the actual units of measurement for the Maya Long Count are 2160 orbits of Jupiter and 144 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/jose/">Paul D.

<p>And here is my favorite quote from that page:</p>
<div class="impact-54-red">Even attempting to discuss the significance 
of this ancient countdown clock which once captivated the imagination of
 an entire world is now passé and invites ridicule, if not disdain or 
utter contempt.</div>
<p>As discussed on pages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/calendars/">№ 19. Ancient calendars and the reconciliation of their start and end dates</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/maya-long-count/">№ 20. Maya Long Count</a>, the actual end date of the Maya Long Count(down) was December 16, 2013,—<em>the year that preparation for the end-time began in earnest</em>. So you see, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the first order of business for the bankers was to lull the public to sleep</em></strong></span>. If you ever for a moment doubt the intelligence of the bankers, think on what happened the morning of December 22, 2012. This <em>Crying Wolf</em>
 incident gave birth to a reactionary “debunker” mentality that forever 
changed the intellectual landscape of the Internet. I generally refer to
 this new class of thinkers as <em>Internet surfers</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What they have in common more so than anything else is a fear of being wrong.</em></strong></span> They are like dear caught in the headlights of an oncoming car, afraid to move, and about to get run over.&nbsp;</p>


<div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>


<div class="intro">Why December 16, 2013?</div>
<p>But what about the five missing days from December 16, 2013, to the 
winter solstice on December 21, 2013? The solstices and equinoxes meant 
everything to the ancients. This makes absolutely no sense unless there 
was a specific reason for ending the Maya Long Count on that date. One 
such reason is discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/calendars/">№ 19. Ancient calendars and the reconciliation of their start and end dates</a>, but I prefer the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Great Wayeb</em></strong></span> explanation discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/maya-long-count/">№ 20. Maya Long Count</a>.
 What I see is the Maya telling us to add five to something, much as 
they had to add the unlucky five days to the end of their calendars 
after March 23, 687 BC when Mars bumped up against Earth’s magnetosphere
 and changed our year from a mathematically perfect 360 days to 365.25 
days. The Maya called the five unlucky days the <em>Wayeb</em>. On this website, I call the suggestion to add five years the <em>Great Wayeb</em>. But to what? If you add five to the end of 13 baktuns on December 21, 2012, you get 2017, the year of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">asterism</a> in <em>The Revelation</em>.
 But you do not know to add five years unless you already know the 
actual end date is December 16, 2013. So where does that leave us? The 
logical answer for me would be to add the five years to December 21, 
2013, but December 21, 2018, has no correspondence to anything the 
Ћinkers are telling us. This is where the potential manipulation of 
critically important dates becomes very frustrating. I want to believe 
the GMT Correlation date is correct. I want to believe the progeny of 
Jove could not be so reckless as to manipulate dates of such importance 
to mankind, but it is beyond question that the birth date of the 
Nazarene was deliberately changed. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I find it extremely interesting that 2012 is exactly 700 years after 1312, the year in which both 322 and 43 were defined.</em></strong></span>
 I don’t know what the answer is except to say that the year in which 
the Nazarene was born cannot be off by more than a few years. The same 
is true for the GMT Correlation date. Archeology has shown that it 
cannot be off by more than a few years. So no matter how this question 
of the end date of the Maya Long Count is resolved, it is clear that it 
would not change the year of the Earth crustal displacement more than a 
few years. And the overwhelming evidence in the numeric symbolism <em>of all three factions of the progeny of Jove</em>
 strongly favors the year 2022. That and the numeric significance of the
 years 2022 (Alpha and Omega), 2023 (axial tilt), and 2024 (always the 
end of something) to the end time is why I can say with confidence that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>January 1, 2025, does not happen</em></strong></span>. Numbers are everything to the progeny of Jove. Numbers are their religion. Or as Pythagoras said, <em>“All is numbers.”</em></p>

<p>The big question of course is, <em>Who added the second Great Wayeb?</em> otherwise known as the “course correction” in the opening scene of <em>The Black Hole</em>. Why was it necessary to add another five years? Are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/nine/"><em>The Nine</em> </a>involved?
 These are inscrutable mysteries for me. I may never know the answer, 
but what I now for sure is that the Ћinkers are clearly telling us 
December 21, 2022. And until the winter of 2022 passes, as far as I am 
concerned, that is when the progeny of Jove think the Fifth World ends,—<em>the Ћinkers, the bankers, and the Jesuits</em>. And now I might add, <em>the Wachowskis</em>.
 But I’ll be here until December 31, 2024 in case this is another false 
alarm. I’ll be making no apologies either. Abstract thinkers do not 
suffer from the necessity <em>to be right</em> as much as they do the necessity <em>to know</em>. Pride will not make me shrink away from my duty to God and country.</p>

<li>As discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a> (which is badly in need of rewriting), at least some sources report that there are 55 sevens in <em>The Revelation</em>.
 I’m guessing those are references to the seven hills of Rome. The 
nascent Ћinkers are using this mechanism to tell you who commissioned 
them to write <em>The Revelation</em>. I am sure you can argue over exactly how many sevens are in <em>The Revelation</em>, but in the Authorized King James Version, edited by no less than Sir Francis Bacon, my money is on a total of 55 sevens.</li>

 I no longer favor Manly Hall. He put his personality ahead of the 
people. But the details about the publication of this book are his 
effort to tell you what I am saying in plain English. In all fairness, 
saying this stuff back in 1928 when <em>The Secret Teachings of All Ages</em> was published would get you killed. And it did. Manly P. Hall was murdered by the bankers.</p>

<div class="intro">A worthy passtime in the end time</div>
<p>Allow me to state emphatically that the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211128213640/https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petter_Amundsen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petter Amundsen</a>
 has forever ended the discussion of who was William Shakespeare (the 
playwright, not the actor) for all but those poor souls lost in the 
madhouse of acadmania [<em>sic</em>]. The question then becomes, who were his closest friends? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Who were these men and women?</strong></em></span> Who dared to plunder the vaults of history and rewrite time?&nbsp; I call them the <em>Ћinkers</em> on this website. They are the men under the command of Queen Elizabeth I. They are the <em>historical</em>
 Rosicrucians and the Freemasons of the South. They are far more than 
you ever imagined. A small group of them are to this very day under the 
orders of a living William Skakespeare. Without them, none of us would 
know what is coming. These are the men who designed and built the 
Georgia Guidestones, and who wrote and produced a whole slew of 
movies—including <em>Tomorrowland</em>, <em>Back to the Future</em>, and <em>The Walk</em>, perhaps in vein—in effort to warn us. I want to pay homage to their predecessors, Sir Francis Bacon and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>“his circle of friends.”</em></strong></span>
 But who were they? This question deserves answering. It worked. They 
did it. We are alive and awake in the end time. This is the time to take
 a moment and reflect upon the lives of those men and woman who second 
only to the bankers defined the world in which we live. The bankers have
 their Virgil longing to witness these times. I was recently asked what I
 thought about the remnant of the Freemasons in Georgia and the 
liklihood they will survive. I quickly reminded the questioner that 
these people have access the riched of the Coca-Cola empire. They also 
have their own granite batholith. Seen in this light, the fact that 
Elberton, Goergia is the “Granite Capital of the World” largely because 
of the number of gravestones they produce every year, —a whole new 
meaning. I got these guys surviving on their own. I think they gave the 
stone of destiny to the bankers as part of a strategic move to do what 
they do best, which is to keep their enemy close. Who knows what lies 
ahead except that it will be unlike anything ever seen in a movie 
because it will all be real including the second chance for mankind.</p>
