# Notes on the "who": progeny of Jove

"The term progeny of Jove is a blanket reference to all of the players, by which I mean all people throughout history in possession of specific knowledge of the end times."

This compromises chapters 8-13 in the master theory index:
- No. 8. Origins of the progeny of Jove
- No. 9. The Nine
- No. 10. Who are the progeny of Jove?
- No. 11. The centuries-old war between the bankers and the Ћinkers
- No. 12. The WiΩards of Fiat Currency: The Rothschilds and the Federal Reserve System
- No. 13. Jesuits and the Black Pope

I am having trouble loading number 8 and 13 while the rest load fine, which indicates these may have been taken down.
