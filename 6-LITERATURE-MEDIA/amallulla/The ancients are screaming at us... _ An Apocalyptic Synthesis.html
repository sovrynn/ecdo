 The “beast” is the coming Earth crustal displacement. This verse in the

<div class="intro">A word to the wise about the importance of simplicity</div>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> were unveiled on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>March 22</em></strong></span>, 1980, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>43</em></strong></span> years before the end. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">end date</a> of the people I call the <em>Ћinkers</em> is December 21, 2023, or more broadly, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>the winter of 2023-2024</strong></em></span>. <em>You have found what you are looking for.</em> The question now is will you still keep looking anyways? Do you really even want to know the truth? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It’s all about the Georgia Guidestones, 322, and 43.</em></strong></span>
 People are looking for something more complicated. But it’s really that
 simple. You can read about the significance of the numbers 322 and 43 
in the section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/#The_paramount_importance_of_the_numbers_322_and_43_in_the_end_times"><em>The paramount importance of the numbers 322 and 43 in the end times</em></a>
 below. Stop looking. Start thinking about how you are going to survive 
an Earth crustal displacement that everyone from the Babylonians to the 
Nazarene said would be the worst planetary catastrophe to ever befall 
mankind. Only a handful of surface dwellers will survive. <em>Your life in the “new world” begins here.</em> No one other than the builders knows more about the Georgia Guidestones than me. <em>No one.</em> Everything else that has ever been published about this monument is meaningless claptrap.</p>
<p class="large-print" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><em>Is this not child’s play?</em></p>
<p class="impact-3x-red" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;"><em><strong>Simplicity is the ultimate camouflage <br>when everyone is looking for complexity.</strong> </em></p>
<p><em>Knowledge of esoteric works, advanced mathematics, familiarity 
with religious texts, the unfamiliar vocabulary used by pretentious 
writers who know damned well what they are doing, none of this nonsense 
is needed to understand everything I am saying. The book is open. </em></p>
<ul><li><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Read. </strong></span>Try to imagine yourself in a strange new world where anything is possible. </em></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Listen. </strong></span>Listen as if your life depended on it. Listening <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>is</strong></span> life. All else is death. </em></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Do not assume. </strong></span>Assume
 nothing. This is a world about which you know nothing. It is, for you, 
an alternate reality. I’ll not pretend otherwise if you don’t. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I rewrite history.</strong></span> Others have already rewritten science and the history of our solar system. </em></li>
</ul><p><em>Mainstream, “consensus” so-called scientists and academia are, on the whole, </em><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/no/">mathematically insane</a></em>.
 That’s not a judgemental statement. And it is not something I wish to 
debate. It is, for me, a highly descriptive, clinical analysis. It took 
me years to arrive at this conclusion. The “mathematical” part takes 
heed of society’s respect for these people, but they are insane. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>They live in an entirely fabricated reality of their own making and provide “artist rendition” proof of its existence.</strong></span></em>
 Meanwhile, the countdown clock keeps ticking away. But don’t worry; 
Tomorrowland assures us we may have as much as a month after that date 
before the world in which we live is forever erased in a single day.</p>

<h2><span id="A_message_from_the_author">A message from the author</span></h2>
<hr><p><span class="entry">LAST UPDATED</span>: December 22, 2021</p>
<p><em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em> consists of 108 pages, the 
ever-growing ASL library, and this homepage which has been completely 
rewritten four or five times now. You can be sure the content on this 
homepage is at the very heart of everything I have to say about the 
coming Earth crustal displacement. It may seem an odd introduction to 
the subject, but that is only because you are not “initiated” (read <em>clueless</em>). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I am describing a world about which you know nothing.</em></strong></span>
 9/11 was not a Muslim terrorist attack. It was not a domestic terrorist
 attack. The financial shenanigans were opportunistic, not the root 
cause. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><b style="color: #ff0000;">The destruction of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, and their </b><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>replacement</b></span><b style="color: #ff0000;">
 with a single “One Word” Trade Center tower was a banker celebration of
 the end time with symbolic roots dating back to the very beginnings of 
the Roman Republic.</b></em></span> It was something only a handful of 
people in the entire world really understand. I am one of them. But no 
one is listening. I have reconciled myself to this baffling reality. <em>It will not change. </em></p>
<p>After learning what is on this homepage, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I personally no longer need any more convincing that the “apocalypse” is imminent</em></strong></span>. I believe that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>all three factions</em></strong></span> of the people I call the “progeny of Jove”—<em>the
 bankers who control the entire Western world, the Ћinkers who are 
descended from Sir Francis Bacon (your William Shakespeare) and the 
original Rosicrucians, but who are now primarily best thought of as a 
remnant of Freemasons in the South from before the Civil War, and the 
Jesuits and Black Pope</em>—sincerely believe an Earth crustal displacement will occur in the next year or so. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is enough for me.</em></strong></span>
 I often say this knowledge changes men. Now that my mind has fully 
accepted the reality that we are living in the end time and the time 
remaining us is less than two years, this knowledge is changing me.</p>
<p>We are fast approaching the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the highly
 symbolic destruction of the Twin Towers, and it was the precise moment 
when I learned that David Rockefeller announced the World Trade Center 
back in 1943 that I felt for the first time a deep and abiding 
conviction that all of this is real. That was a while ago and the 
conviction has remained with me ever since. Hence, this homepage will 
continue to showcase the 1943 announcement of the World Trade Center so 
long as <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em> exists. It was one of those 
extremely rare moments in history when the progeny of Jove in their 
haughty arrogance got careless and showed their hand. My prayer in 
showcasing the 1943 announcement of the World Trade Center by a young 
newlywed banker’s son is that the reader may come to realize the true 
significance of what happened on September 11, 2001. There are as many 
people in the world who understand what happened that day as there are 
people who understand the Georgia Guidestones. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And I really do not give a damn who you are, there is a better than 99.9% chance that you don’t know squat about either.</em></strong></span> You think you do, but you are most likely as ignorant about both as an Australian aborigine. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>You live in a pathetic ignorance so divorced from reality that reaching you is a hopeless cause.</em></strong></span> I am sorry if that sounds arrogant or harsh, but I assure you it is true.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the endless graffiti on the Georgia Guidestones, 
other men of far greater character than I have failed to capture the 
imagination of the people. Yet we must follow in the footsteps of the 
Nazarene,—the man countless millions thought was the Christ,—as well as 
the Bard and do as conscious demands. We must persist to the end in our 
efforts,—not to put <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/website/#My_take_on_the_whole_pearls_before_swine_thing">pearls before swine</a></em>,
—but rather to awaken our fellow man from his endless gorging in a pig 
trough not of his making. That is our duty to God and man. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 struggle to perfect my writing of An Apocalyptic Synthesis will 
continue in the face of a blind indifference I know all too well.</em></strong></span>
 Every single day I see it in my website statistics. The one website the
 entire world should be flocking to in droves has about as much traffic 
as a gas station in the middle of a desert.</p>
<p>No one is listening because of the conceit of their minds. I see that clearly now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I no longer despair of it or delude myself into thinking I can overcome such profound ignorance.</em></strong></span> What I can say with authority is that <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">it will be as the Nazarene said it would be</span></em></strong>.
 They will not know what is happening until it is too late to save 
themselves. I carry with me this promise though; one of you will be by 
my side on Monjeau Peak the morning after. We will survey the 
destruction from on high, shoulder to shoulder, and know what it was 
like to be one of the Bard’s <em>band of brothers</em>. I have thought about this a lot. To understand my decision to keep working on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>, you must allow yourself to see life from the perceptive of <em>the morning after</em>
 when our world has been completely erased by the Pacific Ocean, 
everything as far as the eye can see is a mud flat, and you are isolated
 on a mountain top with a handful of dazed and bewildered strangers some
 of whom do not even comprehend what just happened. Only then does what I
 am doing make sense. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In the 
face of such unimaginable destruction, I will gladly persist for the 
sake of that one man or woman who looked past my mistakes and listened 
to what I am saying.</em></strong></span> We will begin anew. We who heard that ancients screaming at us.</p>

 Georgia Guidestones are designed to fall in place, I believe so that 
they can be easily recovered in the aftermath of the apocalypse. But 
there is another monument to the end-time that escapes the attention of 
most people. It is the Unisphere in New York City. 2014 was the 50<em><sup>th</sup></em>
 anniversary of the 1964-1965 World’s Fair. The Ћinkers used this year 
to very subtly tie together the Georgia Guidestones, the Unisphere, and <em>Tomorrowland</em>. Several months after the 50<sup>th</sup>-anniversary&nbsp;celebration of the Unisphere in New York City, what I call the <em>sacred 216 cube</em>
 appeared in Elberton, Georgia. Many thought the two numbers which could
 be seen while the cube was installed were a date. They were right, but 
no one has ever before revealed the significance of the year 2014 to the
 Georgia Guidestones, and no one ever would have had I not come along. 
This stuff really was not meant for public consumption. I would venture I
 guess, based on how long it has taken me to come to this realization (a
 decade if anyone is counting), that prior to today, March 15, 2022, 
only Royal Arch Freemasons recognized the significance of 2014 on the 
cube below. At present, my discussion of the cube has not been restored 
to the Georgia Guidestones page, but I made a promise to the last donor 
to actually, really return to that work yesterday. I intend to keep that

 understanding and appreciating the symbolism of the Unisphere is where 
the author of this website finds himself after years of intense study. I
 offer my analysis of it to you now. Please try to show some respect. 
This is holy ground for me. And not just for me. The men who designed 
and built the Unisphere are the same men who designed and built the 
Georgia Guidestones and made the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie. All of them are part of the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/timeline/"><em> “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings</em></a>
 brought to you by no less than William Shakespeare (and company). I 
will tell you in advance that where this symbolism approaches the grace 
and beauty of the symbolism in The Walk is in the foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="wp-h2">Base</p>
<p>The Unisphere is centered in a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>310-foot-diameter (94 m)</strong> </em></span>circular
 reflecting pool, with a floor of poured concrete surrounded by a 
bulkhead of granite and concrete. Forty-eight pairs of fountainheads, on
 the outer edge of the pool, are designed to obscure its tripod 
pedestal. Prior to the 1990s renovation, there were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>48 single fountainheads</strong></em></span>. Two pumps in the pool recycle the water that is used in the fountainheads. <em>The
 effect is meant to obscure the tripod supporting the Unisphere, making 
the globe appear as if it is floating in space. From the perimeter of 
the reflecting pool, the Unisphere is meant to depict the Earth as seen 
from </em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>4,000 miles (6,400 km)</strong></span><em> away.</em></p>
<p>The Unisphere is built on a concrete foundation, which includes the piling ring that supported the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Peri</strong></em></span>sphere
 of the 1939 World’s Fair. The marshy soil of Flushing Meadows needed 
special consideration during the original 1937 Perisphere construction. 
The Perisphere, and subsequently the Unisphere, employed a foundation of
 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>528</strong></em></span> 
pressure-creosoted Douglas fir piles of 95 to 100 feet (29 to 30 m) in 
length. Before construction of the Unisphere, three piles were tested 
for structural integrity and all were found to be sound throughout their
 entire length. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Six hundred additional piles were built specifically for the Unisphere.</strong></em></span></p>
<p class="citation">Wikipedia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisphere#Base" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Unisphere</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The factors of 528 are 2, 
3, and 11. Here I will note only that this is the first clear evidence 
of the use of factors in the numeric symbolism of the </strong></em></span>Ћinkers.
 I note this in deference to a member of The 216 Club who pointed out 
another use of factors which as I recall I dismissed on the basis that I
 had not encountered it before. Now I have.</p>
<p>That these factors are intended to indicate the bankers is evident in the 11, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>but there is a classic anti-cipher in that when multiplied together these factors equal 66</strong></em></span>. The 2 and 3 are 23, the Earth crustal displacement or apocalypse. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The Unisphere is predicting the demise of the bankers.</strong></em></span>
 Indeed, it is designed to be smashed to pieces by the Atlantic Ocean. 
Only the highly symbolic tripod base will remain, which I think of as a 
hand holding up the banker’s world so that it can be smashed to pieces. I
 know this because of the numbers used in its design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trylon and Perisphere were two monumental modernistic structures 
designed by architects Wallace Harrison and J. Andre Fouilhoux that were
 together known as the Theme Center of the 1939 New York World’s Fair. 
The Perisphere was a tremendous sphere, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>180 feet (55 m)</strong></em></span> in diameter, connected to the 610-foot (190 m) spire-shaped Trylon by what was at the time the world’s longest escalator. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The
 Perisphere housed a diorama by Henry Dreyfuss called Democracity which,
 in keeping with the fair’s theme “The World of Tomorrow”, depicted a 
utopian city-of-the-future.</strong></em></span> The interior display 
was viewed from above on a moving sidewalk, while a multi-image slide 
presentation was projected on the dome of the sphere. After exiting the 
Perisphere, visitors descended to ground level on the third element of 
the Theme Center, the Helicline, a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>950-foot-long (290 m)</strong></em></span> spiral ramp that partially encircled the Perisphere.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>The name “Perisphere” was coined using the Greek prefix peri-, meaning “all around”, “about”, or “enclosing”.</strong> </em></span>The name “Trylon” was coined from the phrase “triangular pylon”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that in both 1939 and 1964-1965, 
the Ћinkers used meters to convey meaning. This is actually somewhat 
unusual. The significance of 55 meters is of course the 55 foot <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>base</strong></em></span> of the Washington Monument. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#Two_fives_the_numerical_signature_of_the_Cinkers"><em>Two fives, the numerical signature of the Ћinkers</em></a> on page&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 25. December 21, 2023: a date with destiny (the end date of the Ћinkers)</a>
 for a discussion.&nbsp; Some of the other numbers are discussed below. 
As of this writing, I do not know the meaning of all of these numbers, 
but in this context, I would expect most of them to have meaning.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>For example, what does this 119 mean? Are we to ignore it? I think 
not. A word invented by the Ћinkers begs for a numerical equivalent. And
 what about the tripod base. What does that represent? I have likened 
the tripod base to a hand holding up the banker’s world so that it can 
be smashed to pieces by the Allantic. The symbolism of this is founded 
in the history of the Flushing Meadows Corona Park. According to 
Wikipedia, prior to the 1939 World’s Fair, “it was “a dumping ground for
 ashes, since at the time, the land was so far away from the developed 
parts of New York City as to be considered almost worthless.” Here you 
must remember that in the early 1960s is when the Ћinkers learned about 
the plans for September 11, 2001 (9/11). The symbolism of the ashes 
suggests to me they were already aware of the weapon that would be used 
to “dustify” the Twin Towers. But that does not explain the choice of a 
tripod base.</p>
<p>I am convinced this is the final level of meaning in the Unisphere 
base. If you add the 119 and the three from the tripod base, you get 
122. Sir Francis Bacon’s birthday is January 22. I insist on this 
interpretation because the Ћinkers just do not build anything this big 
without honoring their leader. After years of delving into the numeric 
symbolism of the Ћinkers, one comes to expect this depth of symbolism in
 their greatest works. Indeed, in the absence of such depth, I would 
question the interpretation of the data. Allow me to say this somewhat 
differently. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Here is where coincidences stop.</em></span></strong> There are simply too many. I am not imagining this. I am telling you that <em>before there was the Georgia Guidestones there was the Unisphere</em>. Both are relics of this world that are meant to survive <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>more or less</strong></em></span>
 in place. One represents the last twelve Confederate soldiers on a 
battlefield I can damn well assure you is real. The American Revolution 
and the Civil War were only battles in a war for control of the entire 
world to come whose outcome is as yet unknown. What the Unisphere means 
is discussed further below. But I will give you a heads up. The 48 
fountains are the apocalypse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now excuse me while I have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/website/#Batshit_crazy_moments">batshit crazy moment</a> because I just created something out of nothing or I am telling you we are alive right now on an active battlefield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Message</p>
<div>
<p>What it is saying is the exact same thing I have said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>from day one</em></strong></span>,
 which is that Denver, Colorado is a sophisticated deathtrap. The poetry
 of this symbolism is in the reuse of the 1939 World’s Fair base. What 
this represents is the passing of generations of Freemasons in their 
mission to build the Georgia Guidestones and make some of their own 
“providence.”</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I am about to divulge a secret about the design of the Twin Towers that should, </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">were it true</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, get me killed. Yet here I am. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>So I must be batshit crazy, right?</strong></em></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> One guy compared me to Mel Gibson in </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">Conspiracy Theory</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Excuse me for making fun of your dilemma of believing anything I say on </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">. Where it all leads is something I learned in the movie </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">2012,</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
 not even Hollywood can fully grasp. Only the men in the Bible properly 
convey what is about to happen. Mountains are going to “melt.” They saw 
it happen. And the waves? The waves in the movie </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">2012</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;are a joke. They will be at least two miles high. These </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">mountains</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
 of water will dwarf LA and San Francisco. Nothing of them will be left 
behind. Nothing. “Not one stone upon another,” I think is what the 
Nazarene said. And for that they killed him. </span><em style="font-size: 1rem;">Everything is one thing</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> extends to the reason why Christ Jesus was brutally murdered by the Roman elite, the bankers of their day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="intro">The numbers</div>
<p>The Unisphere is 140 feet tall, which is 43 meters. Anyone who 
studies my work should notice the significance of these numbers 
immediately. 43 is the 14<sup>th</sup> prime number. We see this mainly with what I call the <em>sacred 216 cube</em>
 on the Georgia Guidestones. The 20 and 14 that were exposed while the 
cube was installed were not a date. You will see those same numbers in 
the tripod base of the Unisphere also. There are two other numbers that 
are part of this symbolic message. The first is that 140 feet is also 13
 storeys.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image-720"><img class="aligncenter" src="The%20ancients%20are%20screaming%20at%20us...%20_%20An%20Apocalyptic%20Synthesis_files/140-feet-is-13-storeys.webp" alt=""><p></p>
<figcaption>140 feet is 13 storeys</figcaption></figure><p>Coincidence? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Coincidences are for weak minds who must dismiss what I am saying to avoid disrupting their petty existence.</strong></em></span>The
 more I live outside of the MSM propaganda machine, the smaller people 
get. I am losing interest in them. Life exists outside of this flow. If 
you are in it, you fall under the Master’s judgment of letting the dead 
bury their dead. No one has sympathy for you. Not even the Nazarene. 
Wake the fuck up. I’m tired of asking nicely, of pretending there is 
anything you know worthwhile. Until you disconnect from them and start 
living, you are going to get what you deserve, which is an empty, 
meaningless end of life and an unglamorous death. Life is like a bag. 
You can fill it with the stuff MSM is offering, or you can turn it 
upside down, dump everything, walk outside, start living, and fill it 
with your own stuff because if it is filled with their stuff, you are 
not alive. You are the walking dead. And EVERYONE in the know feels the 
same about you. You are getting what you deserve and no one and nobody 
can ever change this except you. Why wait until you die to start living.
 I am giving you 20 months as of this writing. Stop what you are doing 
and ask yourself if you could get this time back, would you spend it 
connected to a thought control machine, or with that kid of yours who is
 going to die without ever knowing what it feels like to be loved, or 
that spouse of yours who may not understand what is happening but still 
made their choice to spend this life with you. For God’s sake, spending 
time with your pets is more meaningful than knowing what is happening in
 Russia on a daily basis. I am not kidding with you. The time you have 
left to live is all you have now. I beg of you to live it. Live! Your 
best thinking will come to you when you are free of the propaganda 
machine. I know that sounds somewhat contradictory to you now because 
you think you have only one source for information, but that is not 
true. If you are pursuing me, the ground will open up below you and 
speak the truth. Now I am going to say something some of you will not 
appreciate because you hate religion. I do too, but the Bible tells us 
this, that an awareness of what is happening will come to us from the 
very fabric of the universe. Why does the Bible say that? Seriously, how
 did these guys know we would be aware of what was happening over two 
millennia ago in a life and time completely foreign to us? This is where
 metaphysics comes into play. Right now ET is surrounding this planet to
 study the end of another cycle. It is their thought we are feeling. In a
 mental world, you cannot lock people in a room and have half of them 
know that if they do not get out of that room by a certain time, they 
will die, without the other half of the people (or at least some of 
them) becoming aware that something is happening. It’s that simple. It’s
 in the air, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="impact-2x-red">YOU DO NOT NEED MSM TO KNOW WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING.</div>
<p>And you DO NOT have to try to tell even your loved ones what you 
think is happening. Let me say that again, DO NOT put a billboard on 
yourself and walk around telling everyone the world is about to end. 
That’s stupid. We are a select group, we who hear trhe ancients 
screaming at us. If anything, we are burdened with the necessity of 
loving everyone around us as much as possible, and becoming the 
messenger of doom is not going to help anyone. I do it because I think 
this is why I was born. But I don’t do it to the people around me. You 
might as well beat yourself on the head with a hammer. Please don’t.</p>
<p>And the final number is the weight of the Unisphere, no small feat. It is 7,000</p>
<div class="intro">Interpreting the numbers</div>
<p>Now let’s talk about what these numbers are saying to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="intro">Two different mindsets</div>
<p>After a decade of intense work pursuing this knowledge, the author 
woke up one day on a battlefield. The Ћinkers, in their latest 
manifestation as the Royal Arch Freemasons of the South in and around 
Atlanta, Georgia have their own tunnel system in black granite. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>Only black granite is not granite.</strong></em></span>It
 is a soft stone not susceptible to the piezoelectricity that I believe 
is going to be the ignoble (and instantaneous) end of the bankers a 
couple of miles down inside of the Pikes Peak granite batholith. For the
 Ћinkers, black granite is the symbol of their survival and of the 
demise of their sworn enemy, the bankers in Denver, Colorado. <em>Here it should be noted that this symbolic use of black granite is not unlike the blackjack flag they flew in their pirate days.</em> It is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/#The_13th_Stone_the_significance_of_black_granite_and_the_Coca-Cola_Company_headquartered_in_Atlanta_Georgia">The 13th Stone</a> at the Georgia Guidestones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This homepage is all about the meaning of 9/11 as opposed to what actually happened, which is discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/dust/"><em>№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</em></a>.
 In the end, at what I would describe as a philosophical level, what we 
are witnessing is the final battle between two radically different 
opinions of the human species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand are a group of men who are bound together by their 
loyalty to Sir Francis Bacon, the greatest man to ever live since the 
Nazarene. Bacon had a measure of the Christ in him. His people have 
given us things like Disneyland, Coke-Cola, the 1964-1965 World’s Fair, 
and Star Trek. At great risk to themselves, they told us who was 
responsible for 9/11. They built the Georgia Guidestones, and have told 
us within one month the end date for the Fifth World, information I 
believe which was the backbone of Elizabethan England and that came from
 Dr. D. If you go further back in our history, they gave us Greece, the 
Olympics, democracy, Athens, and endless architectural wonders including
 all the Gothic cathedrals. They are indeed survivors of a previous 
world age and began life on Crete, where they would later say their god 
Zeus originated. The first thing they did on the world stage is to 
defeat the Persian empire. The last thing they will do in this world is 
defeat the unnamed entity who hides behind need-to-know clearances that 
exclude even the President of The United States of America and who 
control the entire Western world. In other words, the last thing they 
will do for us in this world is to defeat yet another empire. When they 
regrouped under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon, one of the first 
things they did was to defeat the Spanish Armada. Anyone who thinks 
these guys are intellectuals and not street smart is a damn fool. They 
outthink their enemies, and not even the Chinese concept of “total war” 
approaches the long game these guys are playing. Engaging them in a 
fight to the death is like being stalked by a black panther at night. 
The is no winning. That is what Oak Island is all about. I know what the
 fuck is happening. The only question is, <em>Will you listen?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, is Rome. These guys like to think they have a 
history. In fact, they have written our history. They created us in the 
process. What did I just say? I said you are more a product of their 
thought than you are of your parents. They made your parents, too. Ever 
since Magna Gracie, when they learned what was going to happen from the 
Greeks, they have used this knowledge to gain control of the entire 
Western world through banking. This connection, or rather, this 
transition from the Roman elite to bankers is documented in Dante’s 
Inferno. These people have given us International banking, Republicanism
 (designed to control the masses), two world wars and endless other wars
 (sometimes referred to as merely conflicts though in one of those 
“conflicts) 58,000 young men died fighting), cocaine and crack, cancer, 
COVID, and countless other diseases, the <em>Walking Dead</em>, rampant pedophilia, JFK, the Apollo program,&nbsp; and finally, 9/11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see what is at stake? Both groups have had hundreds of years 
to prepare. As an unapologetic Christian Scientist, I have a unique 
perspective on what is happening. I do not share the Ћinkers belief that
 if the bankers survive in Colorado mankind is doomed. No one, not even 
Shakespeare, can discount the reality that this is a mental universe. 
The is a “god,” a governing Principle, as Mrs. Eddy calls it, and it is 
essentially what we think of as a “good” power. Harmony reigns in the 
universe. How long it will take us to see that is all that is in 
question. The bankers are properly motivated. They are trying to keep us
 from rebooting as cavemen, but they carry too much baggage from this 
failed world. Under their leadership, we will get off the planet. I am 
only concerned about what happens after that if these genetic miscreants
 are all the galactic community sees of us. I for one will be headed to 
Atlanta, Georgia if I survive. The Star Trek reality awaits us 
there.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="intro">Why do I defend the bankers?</div>
<p>Well, for one, they are all about to die. But their equipment will 
largely survive, and I can assure you the men in Atlanta know how to 
gain access to the tunnel system in Colorado. So, these guys have 
sacrificed their lives to bring us the equipment we will need to recover
 in the aftermath of the apocalypse. This is where I see my role now. I 
do not think it is possible to protect the people in Colorado from the 
extreme amperage that will be generated when the Pacific Ocean rolls 
over North America, most likely resulting in some increased levels of 
seismicity and volcanism in Yellowstone. I have about a year and a half 
to make that point, to reach one of them in a position of power, and 
convince them of this outcome, not based on science or anything other 
than the evidence I provide here that the Ћinkers are anticipating their
 demise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how I convince myself that I am not here to bring harm to 
Bacon’s people. I declare myself one of them, though not bound by the 
Vow of Silence. I know the respect they had for Mary Baker Eddy, and I 
expect them to see in me something other than a societal outcast who 
could potentially somehow disrupt their plans. Based on these thoughts, I
 continue to write stuff that could get me killed by either group. 
Colorado needs to wake up as much as do the public they have so 
thoroughly buried in their lies. I move forward on the basis that my 
role is to somehow reconcile the bankers and Ћinkers, were that even 
possible. It’s a lofty goal. It is also a little insane of me to think I
 could have that kind of impact on the world right before this happens. I
 know that. But circumstances force me to arrive at some explanation as 
to why what I am doing could possibly hurt the people in Atlanta, 
Georgia who I so admire. I cannot accept this. And I cannot stop 
writing. To do so is not unlike me trying to stop breathing. The 
question you must answer is this; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Is it all just in my head?</em></strong></span>
 At least 22 members of the public have come forward with donations in 
excess of $216 dollars, in effect giving you reason for pause. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the field of psychology, <b>cognitive dissonance</b> occurs when a person holds contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, and is typically experienced as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">psychological stress</a>
 when they participate in an action that goes against one or more of 
them. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not 
psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power
 to change them until they become consistent.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance#cite_note-:0a-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
 The discomfort is triggered by the person’s belief clashing with new 
information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the 
contradiction to reduce their discomfort.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance#cite_note-:0a-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance#cite_note-Festinger,_L._1957-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>What happened on September 11, 2001, is infinitely more profound than
 even the so-called “conspiracy theorists” imagine. My detailed 
arguments against “9/11” being a terrorist attack are on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</a>. <em>I do not repeat anything said on that page here. </em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What
 I discuss on this homepage is the esoteric symbolism behind the 
destruction of the World Trade Center and its replacement with the “One

<div class="intro">Scientia sit potentia</div>
<p>Sure knowledge of the end time changes men. Some it molds into 
indomitable conquerors. Those are the men who have certain knowledge of 
the end time and who are slated to enter the multitrillion-dollar 
granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>They walk as gods among us.</em></strong></span>
 For them, a new world awaits. For everyone else, I feel as though I can
 now speak with authority on this subject when I say you do not really 
want to know the truth. I have crossed that line. For years, I wrote 
what I saw, but in my heart, it was an intellectual exercise, a 
challenge for my “thinker.” When eventually I began to see that it is a 
mathematical impossibility either <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that my mind could <span style="color: #ff0000;">fabricate</span> all of this</em></strong></span> or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that men are doing these things for any reason other than we really are living in the end time</em></strong></span>,
 I washed ashore on a remote desert island of thought, a castaway from 
the daily life of other human beings, left alone in indescribable 
barrenness. “Conative dissonance” is a self-preservation mechanism. My 
“thinker” has kept me isolated from the world all my life, <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but nothing prepared me for this. </span></strong></em>Be
 sure you want to pursue this knowledge because I do not think it is 
possible to arrive at the truth without first passing through this 
melancholy state of mind. But what I found on the other side was a 
clarity of mind and singleness of purpose that makes it possible for men
 to achieve any goal whatsoever. For me, it is finishing this website, 
preparing for what is to come, organizing everything in my life, and 
enjoying what time is left. By that, I mean finding the child in me 
again. “Scientia sit potentia” is Latin for <em>knowledge is power</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><b style="color: #ff0000;">This expression has always been in reference to specific </b><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>knowledge</b></span><b style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;of the end-time.</b></em></span> I invite you to join me, <em>to join us</em>, because this is a growing community of individuals who hear the ancients screaming at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Twin Towers are the “twin trees” in Roman mythology. The one tree that 
“grew so large that it covered the entire world with its shade” is the 
“One World” Trade Center,—or rather what that building represents. And 
what that building represents is what I refer to as the <em>Unknown Entity</em>
 on this website, a group of men who have perfected the art of hiding 
from the public over a period of more than 900 years since the founding 
of the Knights Templar. Their identities are unknown to us because they 
hide behind need-to-know clearances that exclude even sitting 
presidents. They took control of the United States of America after the 
so-called Civil War. Since then, using the military forces of the United
 States of America, its intelligence services, the unconstrained power 
of fiat currency, major corporations—<em>including most significantly, mainstream media,</em>—and the corruptibility of elected officials within the Republican form of government (resulting in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/pedophilia/">rampant pedophilia</a>), <em>they now control not only the end-time infrastructure in and around Denver, Colorado </em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>but the entire Western world</em></strong></span>.

 Mars, nevertheless, had some features which were uniquely Roman. 
Considered more level-headed than the often impulsive and disruptive 
Ares, Mars was also seen as a more virtuous figure by the more 
martial-oriented Romans. As a protector of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://www.ancient.eu/Rome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rome</a> and the Roman way of life and as a defender of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://www.ancient.eu/city/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">city</a> borders and frontiers, important festivals connected to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://www.ancient.eu/warfare/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">warfare</a> were held in his honour and the god was also closely associated with the wolf and woodpecker.</p>
<p>Mars was considered the father of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Romulus and Remus</a>, the mythical twin founders of Rome.

 Rhea Silvia, was raped by Mars while she slept, and in her dreams she 
had a vision where she dropped a hairpin to the ground, and from which 
there sprang two <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>twin trees</strong></span>.
 Over time one of the trees grew so large that it covered the entire

<p>The Old World bankers began life as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/knights/">Knights Templar</a>. If you do not know this, then you need to study the history of the Knights Templar. I am not speaking metaphorically. <em>This is straightforward history.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Knights Templar were the original bankers. They invented international banking.</em></strong></span> They got their seed money from underneath the so-called Temple Mount. It was the wealth of Israel buried there by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legio_X_Fretensis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Legio X Fretensis</a> a millennia earlier after the Siege of Jerusalem. Because, before they were bankers, <em>they were the Roman elite</em>.
 And they learned what they know about the end time from the ancient 
Greeks who settled in Magna Graecia, first and foremost from Pythagoras.
 History is woven much tighter than most people realize. <em>For the past 2,600 years, it has been dominated by men who have specific knowledge about the end time. </em></p>

 challenge in writing this homepage is to make you understand that 
“9/11” was analogous to what happens every year at Bohemian Grove</em>,—
a one-off celebration of sorts to mark the end of the world. But not 
even that analogy comes close to the truth. Only a handful of people in 
this world <em>or the next</em> will ever fully comprehend what happened on that fateful day. If you want to be one of them, keep reading.</p>
<div class="intro">My only prognostication</div>
<p>The truth behind the destruction of the World Trade Center is so 
profound that, once you fully grasp what really happened, you will 
arrive at the same conclusion as did I when the big picture came into 
focus. <em>And that conclusion is that we are at the threshold of something unimaginable.</em> I’m not talking years or decades from now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The
 people who know for sure what is going to happen, who have inherited 
specific knowledge about the end time from a previous world age, are 
saying this going to happen in the next year or so</em></strong>. </span></p>
<div class="impact-72">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">what</span> and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">when</span> of the apocalypse or “day of the Lord” is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Earth crustal displacement</span> most likely in <span style="color: #ff0000;">the winter of 2023-2024</span>, but no later than December 31, 2024. In other words, <span style="color: #ff0000;">January 1, 2025, does not happen</span>.</div>
<div class="intro">Not about money</div>
<p>What has become known as “9/11” was not about asbestos abatement, 
insurance fraud, the Hammer Fund, or the great rubble scam,—all of which
 are discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It was not about money at all</em></strong></span>
 except to the extent that the character of bankers is such that it only
 made sense for them to profit from their foreknowledge of events. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But planning for what you know of as “9/11” began long before any of these financial shenanigans were put into motion.</em></strong></span>
 To think otherwise, would be to seriously underestimate what motivates 
the bankers. One thing writing this website has taught me is not to 
judge any of the players involved. We are facing sure death. Judging 
those destined to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement is best 
left to Enoch and the so-called prophets. You need to focus on awakening
 to this new reality in time to save yourself, your spouse or other 
loved one, and your children. However poorly written at the moment, 
everything you need to know is on this website. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Do not look for others.</em></strong></span> There are none. It is all here and nowhere else.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">These two numbers always refer to the same two dates. Skull and Bones or <em>The Brotherhood of Death</em>
 was never anything more than a recruiting ground for the bankers. Long 
before Yale or the United States of America even existed, on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>March 22, 1312</em></strong></span>, Pope Clement V issued the papal bull <em>Vox in excelso</em> abolishing the Knights Templar. It was subsequently approved by the Council of Vienne on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>April 3, 1312</em></strong></span>. What followed was more gruesome than most people could even imagine. Relative to today’s bankers, <em>these were good men</em>. Their crime? All they had done was escort a few pilgrims to Jerusalem and improve the economy of all of Europe. <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Vox in excelso was a betrayal of the first order.</strong></span></em>
 And mankind has been paying in blood for the sins of the Roman Catholic
 Church in their acquiescence to a petty French tyrant ever since.</p>
<div class="intro">A call to arms</div>
<p>The numbers 322 and 43 are used by the bankers to identify themselves because the original Old World bankers <em>were</em> the Knights Templar. What most people do not realize is that—unlike the Ћinkers—<em>the bankers are a largely unbroken lineage that has only ever increased in wealth and power over the past 900 years</em>. The bankers never forget. And they never forgive. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>These two dates have always been a call to arms for them. </em></strong></span>
 It should be said that, in reference to what happened to the Knights 
Templar on March 22 and April 3, 1312, the numbers 322 and 43 are more 
than 700 years old now and of a greater historical pedigree than the 
more famous 32° and 33° of Freemasonry. The latter two numbers are of no
 greater antiquity than 400 years.</p>
<div class="intro">The so-called Civil War</div>
<p>One of the more controversial pages on this website is page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/civil-war/">№ 54. Civil War and the fall of Freemasonry in the South</a>.
 The author has been verbally bludgeoned by Civil War enthusiasts for 
such radical thoughts as General Grant was a traitor to the South and 
ordered Picket’s Charge to protect the U.S. Capital. President Abraham 
Lincoln was not only a Rosicrucian, but a Southern sympathizer, the 
Gettysburg Address was so short because it was an encoded message of 
encouragement for the rank and file in the South, and more broadly that 
this was actually a war between the Freemasons of the South and the Old 
World bankers who were at the time posing as the European Illuminati, an
 organization that successfully infiltrated the Freemasons and started 
the Northern Jurisdiction in 1813 for the specific purpose of putting 
one of their own in the White House, instigating a war, and taking 
control of the United States of America. Yet this is the truth. I cannot
 and will not apologize for offending the sensibilities of deluded men 
who spend their lives debating inconsequential details ad infinitum 
about of subject of which they in fact know nothing.</p>
<p>President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">James Buchanan</a> 1857-1861 (Pennsylvania) was a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://lodge43.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lodge No. <strong>43</strong>, Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>. As discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/presidents/">№ 51. Freemason Presidents and the Ohio River Valley</a>,
 before Denver, Colorado was taken over by the bankers, the power base 
in the North was the Ohio River Valley, where the Roswell debris was 
initially sent. Their choice of what I characterize as a 
Philadelphia-based (read <em>Northern Jurisdiction</em>) Freemason <em>front-man</em> to instigate the Civil War is one thing. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>That he was a member of a lodge numbered 43 I now think was infinitely more significant from a symbolic perspective.</em></span></strong>
 In essence, what it says is something along the lines of “It’s time to 
get serious. We can no longer afford the niceties of the Freemasonry.”

 Take the time to acquaint yourself with the real history of the United 
States of America. You will not find it in a book. Of that, I am quite 
sure.</p>
<div class="intro">43 on the Rebis woodcut</div>
<p>But do these numbers have other meanings? I ask this question because of the number 43 on the highly important “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rebis</a>” woodcut above. It took me months of hard work to be able to answer this question. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Surprisingly, the answer is no.</em></strong></span>
 These are exclusively banker’s numbers. If you are wondering why 43 
appears on the Rebis woodcut, I’ve moved that discussion to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/bacon/#Other_meanings_of_the_number_43"><em>Other meanings of the number 43</em></a>.
 The short version is that Rebis is the Ћinkers. The dragon is the 
bankers. Rebis combines all of the qualities of masculine and feminine, 
which is to say the Ћinkers are better people, more well-rounded and 
intelligent than the bankers. In the real world what we are talking 
about is your William Shakespeare (Sir Francis Bacon) versus the 
Rothschilds or Rockefellers. This is why the dragon is breathing fire at
 Rebis. The Ћinkers are just better people than the bankers. And the 
bankers are always wont to burn their enemies whenever possible, much 
like their leaders were mercilessly burned to death over 700 years ago. 
Seriously! I’m not making this stuff up. That is precisely what happened
 to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Grissom#Death_and_legacy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gus Grissom</a>
 and the other two “astronauts” who were unfortunate enough to be part 
of the Apollo 1 crew. The bankers do not hesitate to kill anyone who 
gets in their way.</p>
<p>Understanding the differences between these two mentalities and what they are doing with<em> specific knowledge of the end time</em>
 is critically important for the journey on which you are about to 
embark, one so fantastic that in the end you will be alienated from 
everyone around you. Don’t worry. I’m building a like-minded community 
of outcasts at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The 216 Club</em></a>. Trust me. You will not be alone.</p>

<p>The 43 is stamped on the Earth. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It’s what the people did on April 3, 1312</em></strong>.</span>
 That’s what this is all about. The Ћinkers in effect disown the number 
43 by intersecting the 4 with one side of a square and the 3 with one 
side of a triangle. Seeing this is the key to discovering the meaning of
 the Rebis woodcut. The Ћinkers are saying, <em>“These are just numbers to us.”</em>
 By the way, the wings always represent Sir Francis Bacon. This is 
widely known. You see, the Earth is the people, and I am one of them. 
Without Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, otherwise known as 
the <em>Brotherhood</em>, I do not exist. In other words, the man you 
think of as William Shakespeare (the playwright, not the actor) has 
given me wings so that I know what is happening in the end-time. No one 
will take these wings from me. I know that now.</p>

<p>You should never doubt that the bankers are dedicated to their cause. <strong><em>And it is a noble one. </em></strong>Despite all of our human frailties, thanks to <em>providence</em>
 (the second and lesser-known meaning of which is simply “timely 
preparation for future eventualities”), they are prepared to survive the
 coming apocalypse. Their “vault profound” is everything Virgil imagined
 it would be and more. But these are the very same men responsible for 
Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg in the so-called Civil War. If their 
unmitigated savagery in countless other wars—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>all of which they started</em></strong></span>—
from the genocide of Native Americans to Vietnam and Iraq and what 
happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City ever makes you stop and
 wonder at the cruelty of such men, the numbers 322 and 43 are the 
answer you seek. Do I condone this wholesale slaughter of human beings? 
No, <em>but I have come to understand it</em>. It is true that the bankers regard us as the walking dead. But there are always two sides to every story. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The balance you must seek is an understanding of what is at stake.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>If these guys succeed in saving all of our technology—which technology I can promise you based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/#The_2243_minute_MP3_recording_from_the_Walt_Disney_Pictures_Tomorrowland_movie">MP3 recordings</a> released as part of the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie exceeds your wildest expectations—in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system</a>
 in the Pikes Peak batholith, we will find a more suitable planet to 
inhabit for the long-term survival of human beings, Earth will become 
something akin to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://www.startrek.com/database_article/risa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Planet Risa</a>
 in Star Trek where people spend their vacations, and countless 
generations of human beings from then on will know nothing but peace and
 prosperity. What cost is too high to achieve this reality when the 
alternative is that we reboot as cavemen and go through this entire 
sadistic “history” of tribes, nations, and empires all over again? 
Mankind will not reboot as cavemen. Not this time. Not if the bankers 
succeed.</p>
<div class="intro">Poetic license</div>
<p>Allow me the freedom to describe to you what I imagine is the 
symbolic meaning of 322 and 43 to the bankers. These are my words, but I
 am nevertheless using a quote block.</p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>“We are on a mission. We saw into the depth of the human character when faced with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>endless betrayals</em></strong></span> in France. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What
 we learned there is that this mission cannot be compromised by the 
vagaries of petty tyrants such as King Philip IV of France and 
unprincipled churchmen such as Pope Clement V</em></strong></span>. Men 
who would jeopardize the future of all mankind for vein glory are a 
threat to the species, and we will not suffer such fools. Henceforth we 
will use the knowledge we gained in establishing the first global 
banking system to gain control of the entire Western World. And we will 
be as ruthless with our enemies as were these two men to our leaders, 
who they coated with grease and then roasted alive, like pigs on a spit.
 Get in our way <em>and you die</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why?</em> I would ask. <em>Why treat all mankind with the same contempt you hold for these two men who betrayed your leaders so long ago?</em></p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>“Because we do not have time for the foolishness of this world. Our 
purpose in life is to prevent mankind from rebooting as cavemen. It is 
self-evident that this has never before been achieved or else mankind 
would not suffer from amnesia. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are focused on the survival of the species.</em></strong></span>
 We have been furiously working towards this goal since well before May 
1, 1776. And now we control everything. So I say again, get in our way 
and you will die,—or worse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="intro">Letting the people know</div>
<p>Why don’t the bankers tell the people what is happening? This issue was tackled very astutely by the Ћinkers in the movie <em>2012</em>.
 I spent an entire evening very judiciously isolating all of the clips 
involved in this imaginary exchange between the bankers and the thinkers
 on the issue of telling the people the apocalypse is real and “at our 
doorstep” to quote the Nazarene. Think of these scenes as a 
philosophical debate between the two main factions of the progeny of 
Jove. Of course, bankers don’t make such movies, so this is a Ћinker 
presentation,—but one that does reasonably well at presenting both sides
 of the debate. I hate doing video work. It is very tedious and slow. 
But when I saw all of these scenes so carefully cut and sewn back 
together again as one, I deemed it a worthy effort.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">The bankers may not be as omnipotent as they

meaning, it is interesting to note that at <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>precisely</em></strong></span> 1:08:00 minutes into the <em>2012</em>
 movie the words “The Yellowstone caldera has erupted” are spoken. 108 
is one of the most important of all the sacred numbers. The Ћinkers 
don’t do these kinds of things to entertain you. They are telling you 
something they know. I am sure that the bankers have “escape” tunnel 
boring machines (TBM) prepositioned to bore back to the surface for this
 eventuality, but I wonder to what extent they have really planned on 
this happening. A mere 500 miles separate the Yellowstone supervolcano 
and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, which is the front door to Virgil’s “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">vault profound</a>” hiding in plain sight. But the prevailing winds favor them and so may the fates.</p>

<div class="intro">Stanley Kubrick</div>
<p>Stanley Kubrick eventually crossed the line and sacrificed his life trying to tell us the truth about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/moon/">Apollo program</a>.
 But that was not all he was trying to tell us. What people do not know 
is that he started trying to tell us as early as the production of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> with his waving flag in a closed room, mirrored images on visors, and most particularly, with the release date of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>April 3</strong></em></span>,
 1968. Seen in the correct light, this use of 43 is as significant as 
any other use discussed on this website. And what is the correct light? <em>Listen to me, please.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Stanley Kubrick knows the meaning of 43.</em></strong></span> He is using the release date of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>
 to tell us who is behind the movie. And by extension, he is telling us 
who is behind the Apollo program. This is how people talk using the 
symbolic meaning of numbers.</p>
<div class="intro">The Brotherhood of Death</div>
<p>Their first two victims were King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/templars-curse-king-france/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">National Archives</a>,
 “The Pope’s body was placed in a church overnight and the church caught
 fire and the body turned to ashes.” These are the two men who were 
primarily responsible for what happened to the Knights Templar in 
France. But have there been others? Oh my god. <strong><em>Yes!!</em></strong> Page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/jfk/">№ 4. JFK was murdered as a warning to future presidents of the United States of America</a>
 discusses one of their more famous victims. But there have been others:
 inventors of “free” energy; an untold number of businessmen; countless 
journalists; politicians; and the Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed 
White, and Roger Chaffee. They were burned alive, too.</p>
<div class="intro">The game is over</div>
<p>I pay homage to the Ћinkers,—as rightly I should,—by routinely saying
 their impact on the daily lives of people who live in the United States
 of America is <em>inestimable</em>, even though no one is aware of it. 
But the truth is they pale in significance to the impact of the bankers 
on the lives of people <em>all over the world</em>. At this point in history, they probably regard the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em> with their Georgia Guidestones and endless movies as little more than a curiosity. <em>The game is over,</em> as I am fond of saying. <strong><em>The bankers won.</em></strong>
 They are in control of the Pikes Peak batholith and the 
multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system—a highly symbolic 40 miles 
west of Denver, Colorado in the Front Range. But they are in control of 
much more than the end-time survival apparatus. They control not only 
the military and government of the United States of America but through 
the power of major corporations and the corruptibility of businessmen 
and government officials, fiat currency manipulation by the <em>Wi<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ω</span>ards of Fiat Currency</em> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/central/">Federal Reserve System</a>,
 a small army of propagandists and “hackers” (this is a technically 
incorrect use of the term) who are fighting to maintain control of the 
Frankenstein monster they created called <em>the Internet</em> (in a war
 I fear they are going to lose), and even the Republican form of 
government the created which inevitably—and I would argue by 
design—fosters centralized control and assures only a handful of 
“elected” officials must be compromised to control an entire country, <strong><em>they control the entire Western world</em></strong>.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Before continuing, I want to take a 
closer look at Vox in excelso. Far too little attention is given to this
 papal bull. Why? Because it happened a long time ago. Yet this papal 
bull defines both 322 and 43, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>two numbers that pervade our current reality over 700 years later</em></strong></span>. As I write this, I realize I may have failed the reader somewhat in my definition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/website/#The_five_fundamental_principles_of_An_Apocalyptic_Synthesis"><em>The five fundamental principles of An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em></a>. There should have been a sixth. <em>The progeny of Jove do not perceive time as other human beings do.</em>
 Their knowledge of the coming destruction of the planet dates back to a
 previous world age. Organizationally, I feel more than confident in 
saying they began their quest for world dominance not long after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/time/">March 23, 687 BC</a>, which is believed to be our planet’s last close encounter with <mark>Mars</mark>
 before the latter settled into its current orbit. We know Mars is what 
gave birth to the Roman Empire, the origins of the bankers, but the 
timing also suggests the beginnings of the Ћinkers in that by 532 BC 
Pythagoras is already establishing his school in Magna Graecia. So when I
 tell you planning for the destruction of the World Trade Center began 
at the very latest in 1943 or that planning for the Georgia Guidestones 
began no later than in the aftermath of the Civil War, what does it say 
when the average reader recoils at such a suggestion? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In

 has defined your life more than you can possibly know. Hence, you 
really should take the time to learn a little more about this papal bull

<div class="intro">The need to control governments</div>
<p>My reason for wanting to do so is to emphasize that the lesson of <em>Vox in excelso</em>

<div class="intro">Sovereign power</div>
<p>As you will discover shortly, the author of the above work does not understand the papal bull <em>Vox in excelso</em>.
 He thinks it “dissolved the order of the Temple.” This is a common 
misconception and one that is repeated in the Wikipedia article. The 
following author is extraordinary in his ability to <em>correctly</em> interpret the events unfolding in France in the early 13th century. If you read the whole <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://commanderysaintmichael.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/templars-survival/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Templar’s Survival</a></em>
 article, which I highly recommend, you will see that the author is 
somewhat perplexed by the fact that the Knights Templar are seemingly 
oblivious to Pope Clement V’s attempts to reconcile the church with the 
Knights Templar. <em>This too is part of the story.</em> There will be no forgiveness and no forgetting of these <em>unholy betrayals</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Never.</em></strong></span> And there never were. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Two centuries later the bankers took control of the papacy in Rome.</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1312 AD, Pope Clement V issued the Papal Bull <em>Vox in Excelso</em>
 (“Voice From on High”), for final resolution of the status of the 
Knights Templar. This famous Papal Bull is typically claimed and widely 
believed to have “dissolved” the Order, and even proponents of 
Templarism describe it more softly, but still mistakenly, as having 
“suspended” the Order. The historical record, however, proves that in 
fact it merely “suppressed” the Templars, which is a very limited and 
purely political move.</p>
<p>Even Vatican scholars rarely cite the original text of the Papal 
Bull, instead referring to Vatican records which describe it being read 
aloud to the Council of Vienne. Those references routinely note that it 
was read under the overbearing presence of the French King Philip IV and
 his three sons. The official records state the following:</p>
<p>“<em>The Pope said that though he had <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">no sufficient reasons for a formal condemnation of the Order</span></strong>,
 nevertheless, because of… the hatred borne them by the King of France, 
the scandalous nature of their trial, and the probable dilapidation of 
the Order’s property in every Christian land, he<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">suppressed it by virtue of his sovereign power, and not by any definitive sentence</span></strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Declaring that there were “no sufficient reasons”, and that it was 
“not by definitive sentence”, clearly emphasized that it had no real 
legal effect. All official statements consistently highlight (and 
thereby protest) the pressure and interference from the French King, 
indicating that the resulting Papal Bull would be necessarily null and 
void by the legal doctrine of “duress”.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>By the operative key words 
“suppressed it by virtue of his sovereign power”, Pope Clement V 
revealed the true legal context ofVox in Excelso:</em></strong></span></p>

<p>Further proof of what Peter Bernhard is saying can be found in Wikipedia’s article on the <em>Council of Vienne</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="wp-h1"><big>Council of Vienne</big></p>
<hr class="wp-hr"><p>The Council of Vienne was the fifteenth ecumenical 
council of the Catholic Church that met between 1311 and 1312 in Vienne,
 France. Its principal act was to withdraw papal support for the Knights
 Templar on the instigation of Philip IV of France, after the French 
monarch attacked Rome and killed Pope Boniface VIII (Attack at Agnani).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p class="wp-h1">The decisions taken</p>
<hr class="wp-hr"><p>The acts of the Council have disappeared, with the exceptions of a fragment in a manuscript in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">National Library</a>
 in Paris, and of the financial documents of the Templars that were 
requisitioned. The work of the Council was not done in plenary session, 
but a commission was appointed to examine these official records 
concerning the order, with a smaller committee of archbishops and 
bishops presided over by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Aquileia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Archbishop of Aquileia</a>,
 which was to examine exhaustively the official records and the 
abstracts. The pope and the cardinals negotiated with the members of 
this commission respecting the matter. A commission of cardinals was 
also appointed in order to investigate grievances and proposals advanced
 on the subject of church reform.</p>
<p>A majority of the cardinals and nearly all the members of the 
commission were of the opinion that the Order of Knights Templar should 
be granted the right to defend itself, and that no proof collected up to
 then was sufficient to condemn the order of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">heresy</a> of which it was accused by Philip’s ministry, without straining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">canon law</a>. The discussion of Knights Templar was then put in abeyance. The topic changed to the need for an expedition to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Holy Land</a> and about the reform of ecclesiastical morals. The delegates of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Aragon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">King of Aragon</a> wanted the city of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Granada</a> to be attacked, to attack the Muslims on the flank; others wanted a crusade to the east only.</p>
<p>In February 1312 envoys from the Philip IV negotiated with the Pope 
without consulting the Council, and Philip held an assembly in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lyon</a>
 to put further pressure on the Pope and the Council. Philip IV went to 
Vienne on 20 March. Clement was forced to adopt the expedient of 
suppressing the Order of Knights Templar, not by legal method (<i>de jure</i>), but on the grounds of the general welfare of the Church and by Apostolic ordinance (<i>per modum provisionis seu ordinationis apostolicae</i>). The Pope gave to the commission of cardinals for approval the bull to suppress the Templars in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_in_excelso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vox in excelso</a>
 (A voice from on high), dated 22 March 1312. This bull was approved by 
the Council on 3 April 1312 and the Pope announced a future crusade.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">Given the brazen nature of the 9/11 
domestic terrorist attacks, it should not come as a surprise to anyone 
that whoever was responsible for perpetuating the attacks would have 
announced their intention to destroy these buildings ahead of time. The 
progeny of Jove numerically sign their work. They’ve been doing so for 
millennia. The compulsion to respect this deeply ingrained tradition 
that connects them to one another across a vast ocean of time 
(especially on something as historically significant as the destruction 
of the World Trade Center) is so so strong that I have come to 
characterize it as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>their single greatest weakness</em></strong></span>.
 Knowing this is key to understanding them and makes it possible to 
track their movements throughout all of recorded history. Counting the 
rooftops, the seven buildings of the World Trade Center were comprised 
of 322 floors. This is the “real horror” to which I am referring in the 
title of this page. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I don’t think they ever expected anyone to notice this. </em></strong></span>But it doesn’t stop there. <em>This numerical signature encodes the year of the apocalypse.</em></p>

<div class="intro">The history of the progeny of Jove</div>
<p>Once you accept that the number of storeys, not unlike the 13 steps 
of a gallows, includes the rooftops, the total number of storeys for the
 Twin Towers would have great significance to the progeny of Jove. In 
fact, given what I know of the importance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/signatures/"><em>numerical signatures</em></a> to the progeny of Jove, this number would be of profound importance. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And it is.</em></strong></span> They are called the <em>North</em> and <em>South</em>
 towers because they symbolize the struggle for control of this country 
between the Old World bankers and the Freemasons of the South (descended
 from Sir Francis Bacon) which culminated in the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/civil-war/"><em>Civil War</em></a>. But that <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">war between the bankers and Ћinkers is centuries old</a></em>. More broadly, the Twin Tower represent the two main factions of a people I call the <em>progeny of Jove</em> (defined as <em>anyone who has specific knowledge of the end time</em>); namely, the <em>bankers</em> and the <em>Ћinkers</em>, the <em>Boaz</em> and <em>Jachin</em> pillars of Freemasonry, the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Moon</em>,
 two very different mentalities at work in the end-time. It’s a long 
story, one that will require you to “come out from among them, and be ye
 separate” to understand, that and a lot of reading and thinking, and it
 is told only on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>. You will not find it anywhere else in the world. I can assure you of that.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this highly symbolic 222 <em>in one of the most important numerical signatures of all time</em> is to unmistakably group together the three numbers that total 43.</p>
<div class="intro">3-4-5 Pythagoras triangle</div>
<p>Since the early medieval period, the year 222 AUC (a<em>b urbe condita</em>) in the Roman calendar has been regarded as the year the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pythagorean community</a>

of years since 753 BC, the traditional founding of Rome. What this 
number signifies is the passing of specific knowledge of the end time 
from the ancient Greeks to the Romans (i.e. <em>from the Ћinkers to the bankers</em>). Thus the very design of the World Trade Center acknowledges that the source of this information was the ancient Greeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year 532 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 222 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ab urbe condita</a>.<br>…</p>

<p>Pythagoras arrives in the Greek colony of Croton (modern-day Crotone) in Magna Graecia and founds the philosophical school of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pythagoreanism</a> (approximate date).</p>

<p>The indirect reference to Pythagoras suggests grouping buildings 
three, four, and five together as in a 3-4-5 right triangle (the 
smallest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pythagorean triple</a>).
 However, here I must say that I did so quite naturally and long before 
becoming aware of the significance of the year 222 AUC in the Roman 
calendar.</p>
<div class="intro">The stamp of death</div>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>And here is the 43.</em></strong></span>
 Can you not see that this is deliberate? I cannot be imagining all of 
this. It’s real. It’s in your face. Long before the first blueprints 
were ever produced, David Rockefeller and the other bankers predestined 
this building to be destroyed on September 11, 2001. The amount of 
planning that went into this easily exceeds that of the Georgia 
Guidestones. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Hence, I have come to regard the destruction of the World Trade Center as what I call an end-time marker.</em></strong></span>
 Not even the bankers would do something like this unless the end was 
starring us in the face. They are just making everyone else in the know 
aware of the advanced weaponry at their disposal should anyone be 
contemplating throwing a monkey wrench into their plans. That everyone 
else would most certainly include the Russians, Chinese, and the 
Jesuits.</p>

<p>The 23 has been separated out to symbolically represent the coming 
Earth crustal displacement (or axial tilt). Then the remaining twenty 
was split between buildings four and five to satisfy the need for the 
3-4-5 Pythagoras triangle. But something else is at work here. You have 
the year of the apocalypse, 20 + 23, or 2023, as discussed throughout 
this website. That makes the original World Trade Center 3 (WTC 3) very 
special. Indeed, it is. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>WTC 3 connected the North and South Towers.</em></strong></span></p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, construction of the original WTC 3 began in March of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>1979</em></strong></span>. This is the same year the movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Hole_(1979_film)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Black Hole</em></a> was released. Now you’re probably thinking, <em>“What does a cheesy sci-fi movie have to do with 9/11?”</em> The answer to that question is found on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/fireworks-finale/">№ 28. The fireworks finale of end-time warnings</a>.
 Like I said, you have a huge learning curve ahead of you, a long road 
to travel, if you will. At the other end of it is sure knowledge of the 
end time, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>knowledge that may save your life</em></strong></span>, but only a handful of you will ever make it there.</p>
<p>What remains after the WHEN and WHAT is 57. What they did with that was ingenious.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 28px;">The number nine is always a reference to 
command and control. In this context, it symbolically represents the 
bankers. The number 13 as always is a reference to the Ophiuchus

building seven are a reference to Ptolemy’s 48 classical constellations 
which include Ophiuchus.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">As stated in Wikipedia, “The 47-year cycle of
 Mars: after 47 years – 22 synodic periods of 780 days each – Mars 
returns to the same position among the stars and is in the same 
relationship to the Earth and Sun. The ancient Mesopotamians discovered 
this cycle.” This and the fact that WTC 7 was clad in <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">red granite</span></em></strong> is making an unmistakable statement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Symbolically speaking, this was one of the strongest statements made by the bankers in the design of the World Trade Center.</em></strong></span>
 It clearly signifies that they perceive their origins to be as the 
elite ruling classes in the Roman Empire. Learning how the Roman elite 
morphed into bankers, as attested to in Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>, is another huge lesson you must learn to get where you are going.&nbsp;</p>

 If you think it unimaginably cruel to send so many people to their 
deaths to make such a statement, you lack the perspective of the progeny

<p>You must ponder this question because it is of profound importance 
for your understanding of what is happening in the world right now. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Why was this young man announcing the World Trade Center in 1943?</em></strong></span>
 The answer to this question is simply that this is an example of 
multigenerational planning. David Rockefeller can be removed from the 
equation. This is obviously the work of his father John D. Rockefeller, 
who is merely taking attention off of himself. The real question is,</p>

<div class="intro">“A journey that begins where everything ends…”</div>
<p>But even that pales in significance when you realize that the Ћinkers responded by releasing <em>The Black Hole</em> movie in 1979, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>43 years before the winter solstice in 2022</em></strong></span>. The author David Montaigne to whom I dedicated page <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a></em>
 was the first to notice this. In the end, this second reference to the 
year 2022 may be the single most important thing we can learn from the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie because,—in the context of the “course correction” in <em>The Black Hole</em>,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>it suggests very strongly that the Earth crustal displacement is expected in 2022</em></strong></span>.
 Everything and everyone who matters is screaming that we are at the 
threshold of something that is going to erase the world in which you 
live in a single day. I can give you the facts, but I cannot make you 
understand the significance of all of this. Internalizing the reality 
that we are the last generation is individual. No one can make you see 
this. In some very real sense, it is between you and God or whatever 
name you want to give to consciousness.</p>
<div class="impact-72"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Timing is everything.</span> Men would never even imagine such things as the destruction of the World Trade Center, the Georgia Guidestones, or <em>Tomorrowland</em> were it not that they knew for sure the world in which we live is about to be utterly destroyed. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This is the end time. </span></div>

<p>Though not yet written, on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 28. A date with destiny: The year of the apocalypse</a>, the very first subsection under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#2022">2022</a> is all about the five-year “course correction” at the start of <em>The Black Hole</em> movie which is indirectly referenced in a scene from <em>Tomorrowland</em> inside a collectibles store named <em>Blast from the Past</em>. The five-year “course correction” is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">September 23, 2017</a>,
 to the year 2022. This is the last effort of the Ћinkers to warn the 
people about the coming Earth crustal displacement. What does it mean 
that <em>The Black Hole</em> was released exactly 43 years before the 
winter solstice on December 21, 2022? And does this mean the world is 
going to end on that date? No! <em>Let us not make that mistake again.</em> The world is not ready for another December 21, 2012. I believe <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the
 date December 21 is just piggybacking December 21, 2012, as a way of 
symbolically affirming that this is the year of the apocalypse</em>.</strong></span> The following video is the first highly symbolic 58 seconds of the <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 movie, which is precisely how long it takes for the main character to 
come into focus. This 58 seconds is of course a nod to Queen Elizabeth I
 as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/">№ 53. SN 1604, Sir Francis Bacon, and the origins of the Rosicrucians</a>. You can stop and start this video at will to demonstrate that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>there is no Tomorrowland until after the first 43 seconds</em></span></strong>. That is to say, <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 exists only in the next world, after the coming apocalypse. Timing is 
everything in this movie, perhaps none more than these first 43 seconds.</p>

<p>An astute observer will also notice that <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">WALT DISNEY PICTURES <small>PRESENTS</small></span>
 appears at the 32-33 second transition. This is the Freemasons of the 
South reminding you who made the movie (as if anyone in the know had to 
be told). None of this stuff is by chance, and if you are inclined to 
think otherwise, it is simply because you have not learned how to 
interpret movie symbolism in which runtimes are critical.</p>
<div class="intro">The greater context</div>
<p>You need to read and study page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/sn1604/">№ 53. SN 1604, Sir Francis Bacon, and the origins of the Rosicrucians</a>
 (and by extension the Freemasons) in order to put what I just said into
 context. You should learn more about what happened in Elizabethan 
England than I know because I do not have the luxury of reading this 
website. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">Georgia Guidestones</a> and <em>Tomorrowland</em>
 are the culmination of 400 years of work to warn the people about the 
coming apocalypse. What so many of you do not know and what I fear you 
will not take the time to learn is that this effort was begun by the man
 you know of as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>His real name was Sir Francis Bacon.</em></strong></span>
 These are good men. I didn’t know what to think about them when I 
started writing and confused them with the European Illuminati (i.e. the
 bankers). <em>I labored under the misconception that all of the secret societies were essentially the same.</em> Nothing could be further from the truth. I have learned to respect the bankers because <em>like it or not</em>
 they are our best hope now. But my respect for the original 
Roscicrusians and the Freemasons of the South deepens the more I learn 
to the point that I am now fond of saying <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Sir Francis Bacon had a measure of the Christ in him</em></strong></span>. There is no more special period in all of history than what happened in Elizabethan England. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is sacred ground.</em></strong></span>
 You may not know this, and you may never take the time to learn that 
what I am saying is the truth; however, you may be acquainted with the 
butchery of the so-called Civil War.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly 2% of the population, <strong>an estimated 620,000 men</strong>,
 lost their lives in the line of duty. Taken as a percentage of today’s 
population, the toll would have risen as high as 6 million souls.</p>
<p class="wp-h1" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">The Numbers Illustrated</p>
<p>The human cost of the Civil War was beyond anybody’s expectations. 
The young nation experienced bloodshed of a magnitude that has not been 
equaled since by any other American conflict.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">Ever since the World Trade Center was 
announced by a young David Rockefeller back in 1943, those buildings 
were destined to be destroyed on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>September 11, 2001</em></strong></span>.
 Why is this date so special? What does it mean to the bankers? It has 
taken me years to arrive at this answer. This date has two parts: the 
day of the year <em>September 11</em> and the year <em>2001</em>. I will
 address the year in the next section. In this section, I only discuss 
September 11 or 911. The year is discussed in the next section.</p>
<blockquote class="large-print highlight">
<p>Before continuing, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>you must understand that</strong> The Revelation was written for the Roman elite</em></span>, the predecessors of the bankers. I cannot overemphasize this. You must read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>.
 Both of these books were commissioned by and for the progeny of Jove. 
One was written by Jews. The other was written by predecessors of the 
people I call the <em>Ћinkers (i.e. Christians)</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>and very well may be what gave birth to them</strong></em></span>. <em>The Revelation</em> caries in it serious misdirection intended for the Christians of this era, <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but it also includes some our earliest warnings from fellow Christians that something is afoot.</span> </strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="intro">September 11</div>
<p class="first-paragraph">But why September 11? Why this particular 
date? If you knew what I did about the progeny of Jove, you would know 
this date must be somehow profoundly important. Or so I thought. <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">I was so focused on the date, I overlooked the number.</span></em></strong> All that changed when I watched this video about the Hoover Dam (which was originally called the <em>Boulder</em> <em>Dam)</em>.</p>

 This is six years before David Rockefeller announces the World Trade 
Center to an unsuspecting world in 1943. For me at least, this pushes 
back Ћinker knowledge of September 11, 2001, to well before July 7, 
1930, when construction of the dam began as they clearly had a role in 
its design. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This film is unquestionably intended to convey something of immense importance.</em></strong></span>
 The 37 in 1937, by the way, is the complementary angle of 53 in a 3-4-5
 Pythagoras triangle, and the number 53 is always a reference to Sir 
Francis Bacon who started the original Rosicrucian and Freemason secret 
societies so that ours,—the last generation,—would be made aware of what
 is happening.</p>
<p>I was captivated by all of the highly symbolic numbers in this short film such as the date June 6, 19<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>33</strong></span>. Of course, June 6 is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">66</span></strong>, the same as D-Day in WWII. This was the date on which the very first concrete was poured.</p>
<blockquote class="highlight">
<p>It was on June 6, 1933, that the first bucket of concrete was placed 
in the very lowest of the dam forms, 135 feet below the level where a 
few months previously had flowed the unchallenged Colorado river.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The dam is also <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>66</strong></span>0 feet thick at the base. Towards the end of the film, we hear, “The roadway traversing its <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>13</strong></span>00
 foot crest forms a magnificent link in a transcontinental highway.” But
 what really caused me to sit up and pay attention was a few sentences 
later when we hear “with a shoreline of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span>0
 miles.” You will read about the significance of the number 55 below. It
 is a numerical signature of the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>At this point, I was transfixed.</em></strong></span>
 Comparatively speaking, this is “in your face” use of highly symbolic 
numbers. That level of obviousness is in and of itself unusual for the 
Ћinkers, who I am now certain are behind the making of this film.</p>

<p>But the dam height of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">730</span></strong>
 feet is what initially caught my attention while first watching the 
film. You might say, “Well that’s just how high the canyon was,” but 
they dug down 135 feet below the river bed and removed “two million tons
 of rock, earth, and sand.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Day by day, week after week, the top workings of the structure 
approached its full height of 730 feet, far above the crest of any other
 dam yet built by man or likely to be built for years to come</p>

<div class="impact-72">730 feet is the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>exact</strong></span> depth of the White Ash Mine disaster on September 9, 1889, exactly 132 years ago as of this writing.</div>

<p>If you read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/batholith/#The_White_Ash_Mine_disaster"><em>The White Ash Mine disaster</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">№ 58. The multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith</a>,
 you will realize that for the longest time I thought the September 11, 
2001 date had something to do with this mining disaster, a major setback
 in the construction of what is now a multi-trillion-dollar tunnel 
system in Colorado. I tried for many months to make that work, but 
eventually abandoned the idea and had all but given up on ever 
discovering why the progeny of Jove chose the date September 11, 2001, 
to destroy the World Trade Center. I can assure you though, the 
Freemasons to this very day mourn the death of those men and I am as 
certain as I am the air I breathe that the height of this dam is in 
memory of them. The White Ash Mine disaster was a major setback for 
their plans to survive the coming Earth crustal displacement at a time 
when they were just getting started in Colorado.</p>
<p>It became apparent to me that besides being the largest of its kind in the world when it was built, <em>this dam was highly symbolic</em>. It is providing electricity to Los Angeles where films such as <em>Back to the Future</em> will be filmed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">age-old conflict</a>
 between the bankers and the Ћinkers. That makes the electricity 
produced at this dam something of a weapon. And it was at the end of the
 film when it started discussing electrical production that things took 
an unexpected turn involving more highly symbolic numbers, <em>but those associated with the bankers</em>.
 “Perched on shelves hewn into the canyon walls, [the four intake 
towers] tower 403 feet to an elevation above the crest of the dam and 
the rim of the canyon.” You will see this number again. It s widely 
reported that 403 is the exact number of first responders who died on 
September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>In light of everything else, this was a painfully obvious reference to banker number <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>43</strong></span>
 discussed on this homepage. Now you may be inclined to think turning 
403 into 43 is a stretch. I might even agree if it were not for two 
things. 403 feet is a very specific number, and every bone in my body 
tells me it is deliberate. But now listen to what happens next, because 
this is what caused me to jump out of bed.</p>
<div class="intro">Unexpected reference to 9/11</div>
<p class="first-paragraph">At 32:09 minutes, we hear, “The first generator was placed in operation on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>September 11</em></strong></span>, 1936.” <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This could only mean one thing.</em></strong></span></p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">September 11 is not a date.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">It’s a number.</span></div>
<p>But what does the number 911 mean? It did not take long to figure out
 the answer to this question, but if you are new to my work, you really 
do need to read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/plants/">№ 66. The Book of Daniel and The Revelation</a>. The bankers wrote <em>The Revelation</em>. Understanding this is central to much of my work.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">September 11 is a reference to<br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Revelation 9:11</span></div>
<blockquote class="large-print bible-verse">
<p><strong>Revelation 9:11</strong><br>And they had a king over them, 
which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew 
tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="intro">Hapax legomena</div>
<p>As noted in the text of this verse, <em>Apollyon</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Abaddon. It is widely reported as the <em>present participle</em> of the Greek verb <em>apolluo</em>, “to destroy.”</p>

<p>This same “A destroyer” marginal note is present in the Latin Vulgate as “in Latin <i>Exterminans,</i>” <i>exterminans</i>
 being the Latin word for “destroyer.” Still, I find it interesting that
 the Ћinkers chose to preserve this note in their translation of <em>The Revelation</em>.</p>
<div class="intro">Death and destruction</div>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible, Abaddon occurs six times but is translated as <em>destruction</em>.
 So once again, the English word “Abaddon” occurs only once in the 
Bible. This is very significant in explaining why September 11 was 
chosen as the date on which the bankers would unleash their death and 
destruction on the world. The uniqueness of this verse,—and it message 
of death and destruction,—has been carefully preserved for almost two 
millennia now.</p>
<p>Here one must recall that although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> states, <em>“During
 the September 11 attacks in 2001, 2,977 people were killed, 19 
hijackers committed murder–suicide, and more than 6,000 others were 
injured. The immediate deaths included 265 on the four planes, 2,606 in 
the World Trade Center and in the surrounding area, and 125 at the 
Pentagon</em>,” for the past 20 years countless millions of men, women, 
and children were killed and maimed in the Middle East and the 
infrastructure of entire countries were destroyed, including Iraq which 
is the very same Babylon referred to in Revelation 18. Was another 
self-fulfilling prophecy written and executed by the bankers? The terms <em>false flag attack</em> or <em>domestic terrorism</em>
 do not do justice to what has happened over the past 20 years. Some of 
the finest men in this country were sent to their deaths. Others are 
maimed for life. And what we have left behind can only be described as <em>death and destruction</em>. This is the very meaning of Abaddon in Hebrew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>II. Old Testament Background.<br>1. Fundamental Meaning:<br>The term 
Abaddon (“destruction”) appears solely in the Wisdom literature of the 
Old Testament and in the following narrow range of instances: Job 26:6; 
28:22; 31:12; Ps 88:11; Pr 15:11. In all these passages save one (Job 
31:12) <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the word is combined either with Sheol, “death,” or “the grave,” in such a way as to indicate a purely eschatological term</em></strong></span>…</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is madness, and it is a madness brought about by the sure knowledge that the entire world is about to be destroyed. </em></strong></span>Why did we go to the Middle East? I suspect the answer is much simpler than most people can accept. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/war/">War is a pastime for the bankers.</a>
 It enriches their coffers, depopulates the world, and gives them 
something to do while they wait for the inevitable destruction of the 
entire world. I think they went to Iraq just to pillage it museums and 
collect artifacts to preserve for their children in the new world to 
come.</p>
<p>This “king” in Revelation 9:11 <strong><em>is</em></strong> the bankers. <em>We are the walking dead to them.</em> The “king” is not an individual. Satan is Saturn. As is the case with almost all apparently <em>evil</em> symbolism, the concept of a devil or Satan is rooted in out planet’s catastrophic past. <em>There is no “pure evil” about to be unleashed on the world because there are not two powers in eternity.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Logically speaking, there cannot be.</em></strong></span> Sooner or later one would succumb to the other. That is why I characterize the belief in a devil as essentially <em>not monotheistic</em>. God, the fabric of the universe, is omnipotent. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>To believe otherwise is to have more than one god</em></strong></span>, and right now this describes the overwhelming majority of so-called “Christians” in the world. <em>The bankers know this, which is why they want to put an end to this religious insanity.</em> The world will be better off without religion, without the buildings that make involuntary hypocrites of us all. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I am in sympathy with the bankers on this point.</em></strong></span> Live your religion. Forget the buildings. “All the world’s a stage.”</p>

<div class="intro">What fools are we?</div>
<p>The 911 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Emergency_telephone_number_911">emergency telephone number</a> in number in <em>The United States of America</em> is a classic case of <em>predictive programming</em>. When I step back and think of the February 1967 “The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society” report discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/implosion/#The_Police_State_militarization_of_the_police"><em>The Police State (militarization of the police)</em></a>—
which is what gave birth to the 911 national emergency telephone 
number,—I am in awe of the level of mind control the bankers exercise 
over the general population. Mind-boggling, multigenerational planning 
is all it took for us to fall into line and start referring to the 
gruesome murder of thousands of people in the United States and 
countless millions in Iraq and Iran as if it were some kind of an old 
fashion advertising jingle.</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">Before there was Revelation 9:11, there were 
prime numbers. And symbolism at this level is always going to be about 
numbers because numbers are the religion of the progeny of Jove. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>What
 I am saying is that the destruction of the World Trade Center was not 
on September 11, 2001, because of Revelation 9:11, but rather Revelation
 9:11 and the events of September 11, 2001, are based on prime numbers.</strong></em></span>
 It would be difficult for me to fully explain the importance of primes 
numbers to the progeny of Jove. But I will say this. When during my 
studies a number first catches my attention, the first thing I do is 
check to see if it is prime. 911 is prime. The second thing I do is to 
check what prime number it is in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_numbers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">list of prime numbers</a>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is the 156<sup>th</sup> prime number. </em></strong></span>This
 alone may be why September 11 was chosen in the first place. Please 
note that John Donne was a contemporary of Sir Francis Bacon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 2em;">For Whom the Bell Tolls</span><br>by<br>John Donne</p>
<div style="margin-left: 432px; font-size: 1.5em;">
<p>No man is an island,<br>Entire of itself.<br>Each is a piece of the continent,<br>A part of the main.<br>If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>Europe is the less.<br>As well as if a promontory were.<br>As well as if a manor of thine own<br>Or of thine friend’s were.<br>Each man’s death diminishes me,<br>For I am involved in mankind.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Therefore, send not to know</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>For whom the bell tolls,</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It tolls for thee.</em></strong></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>The old mantle clock in my maternal grandparents’ home would chime the hour of the day every hour on the hour. Do the math.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 27px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>

<p></p>
<p class="typewriter" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12) x 2 = 156</p>
<p>So you see, by using the 156<sup>th</sup> prime number, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>t</em></strong><strong><em>he progeny of Jove are invoking the passage of time</em></strong></span>. That’s all these people do; they prepare for the coming Earth crustal displacement. What we mere mortals consider to be <em>life</em>, is nothing more for them than <em>the passage of time</em> awaiting what they know to be the inevitable destruction of this world. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>There is no way in hell this is a mere coincidence.</strong> </em></span>So I say again, the decision to use 911 probably began with the fact that it is the 156<sup>th</sup> prime.</p>
<div class="intro">2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13</div>
<p>Those are the first six prime numbers. You see, <em>“I am No. 5, the Third Prime in Life.” </em>We don’t say <em>“nine hundred and eleven” </em> when talking about September 11, 2001, we say <em>“nine eleven.”</em> The number 9 is the most sacred number of all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/gods/">sacred numbers</a>
 because all of the other sacred numbers are a multiple of nine. For the
 uninitiated, what I just said will be of no consequence, but such are 
destined to die in the coming Earth crustal displacement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is why nine is always used to signify command and control.</em></strong></span> And now I am going to explain to you even more precisely why the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">11 is the last prime number<br><span class="impact-3x-red">before 13</span></div>
<p>And 13 is the number of the end time. It always has been. I discuss this at length on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/galactic-center/">№ 29. Number 13, Ophiuchus, the Galactic Center, active Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic Superwaves</a>. That is why there were 13 colonies. That is why 13 is plastered all over the one-dollar bill. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is one thing</em></strong></span>, and long before <em>The Revelation</em>
 was ever written, 911 was destined to be the verse in which the bankers
 would begin their march towards what happened twenty years ago on 
September 11, 2001. I don’t really give a damn what you think, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>but I will assure you this is what 911 is all about</em></strong></span>,
—prime numbers and the coming Earth crustal displacement. Once you enter
 into this world of sacred numbers, it really is “a small world after 
all.” There’s nothing complicated. Nothing difficult to understand.</p>
<div class="intro">Conclusions</div>
<p>The big picture here is that the bankers are alluding to <em>The Revelation</em> and the passage of time and therefore to the apocalypse or end of this world. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What happened on September 11, 2001, when properly understood is one of the biggest signs that we are “at the door.”</em></strong></span>
 And that is all you really need to know about 911. It was a doomsday 
message from the bankers. It was them shouting out “Finally, the time 
has come and we no longer need to concern ourselves about what the 
walking dead think. The world is ours now to do with as we please. For 
in a short time, in the blink of an eye, all of this shall be gone, and 
we will tell our children bedtime stories about how the land on which 
they live was once called <em>The United States of America</em>.” And 
they will explain to their children how primitive a people we were, how 
we believed in ghosts and goblins (religion), and how gullible, stupid, 
and easily manipulated we were. And that will be the end of us. 
“Tomorrow is just a dream away.”</p>

<p class="first-paragraph">Let me give you a hint. If you fancy yourself
 a student of the end-time and are not aware of the role Sir Francis 
Bacon plays in all of this as discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>,
 I would liken you to a clown who overslept, was given the wrong address
 by someone who really doesn’t like him, and shows up at a funeral in a 
Yellow cab, only to have it drive away before he realizes something is 
wrong. Standing there in the middle of the street and drawing unwanted 
attention from the distracted mourners, he begins to question everything
 about his life and where he went wrong. But don’t worry, I know how you
 feel. I’ve been at this for years, and I never did the math on the 
1964-1965 World’s Fair until the date on which this section was added. 
According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>,
 “The fair ran for two six-month seasons, April 22 – October 18, 1964, 
and April 21 – October 17, 1965.” Because we are talking about the <em>end of the world</em>, we use the <em>end</em> date. <em>1964 is misdirection.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">Here are two simple addition statements that have had an enormous impact on your life whether you know it or not.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1943 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2001</div>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1965 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2023</div>
<div class="impact-216-red" style="text-align: center;">58</div>
<p>So did you get the hint? If <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is one thing</em></strong></span>
 has any meaning other than the coming Earth crustal displacement, it’s 
Sir Francis Bacon’s mother, Queen Elizabeth I, who ascended to the 
throne in 1558. And if you’re late to this party, let me tell you, 
William Shakespeare (the playwright, not the actor) was Sir Francis 
Bacon. Thanks to the work of an obscure Norwegian organist by the name 
of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/bacon/#Petter_Amundsen_and_the_meaning_of_numbers_53_and_106">Petter Amundsen</a>,
 the identity of William Shakespeare is no longer an open question. But 
the Norwegians should temper their pride because Petter Amundsen traded 
it all for the pursuit of riches. It is a sad tale that caused me to 
create the unfinished page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/oak-island/">№ 50. Shakespeare’s last play: Oak Island (a tragedy)</a>.
 But I hold Petter Amundsen in high regard if for no other reason than 
Wikipedia, a fully owned subsidiary of the bankers, does not have an 
article about him to this very day. That puts him in the company of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Dr_Judy_Wood">Dr. Judy Wood</a> as people the bankers consider so threatening in the end time that <em>they are blatantly suppressing knowledge of them</em>.</p>
<div class="intro">A brief rant</div>
<p>Before I continue, allow me a brief rant on this most special of 
days. If you call yourself a Christian Scientist and yet are unaware of 
the fact that this is <em>precisely</em> why Mary Baker Eddy began her chapter entitled <em>The Apocalypse</em> on page 558 of <em>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures</em>, you need to stop “malpracticing” me and read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/sixth-seal/">№ 33. Mary Baker Eddy and the end-time</a>. Mrs. Eddy’s warning about the year 2022 was perhaps <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the most eloquent and sophisticated warning of them all</em></strong></span>. I have more respect for what the bankers are doing in Colorado than I do for the current generation of Christian Scientists. <em>The movement is dead</em>
 and I have stood alone “a voice crying in the wilderness” to more 
“Journal-listed” (read official sanctioned) practitioners and teachers 
than I can recall at present. And they have to a man or woman <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>steadfastly refused to read that page</em></strong></span>.
 I thought when I experienced the meaning of “Let not then your good be 
evil spoken of” (Romans 14:16) after 13 years of caring for my elderly 
Christian Science teacher, I knew all there was to know about this 
wretched movement. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I was wrong. </em></strong></span>Religion sucks.</p>

<p>Denver, Colorado was founded (or “platted”) on November 22, 1858. 
Nothing this critical in the history of Denver, Colorado was left to 
chance. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Denver International Airport
 was held on November 22, 1989. This date clearly means something. But 
what? As we have seen, 322 and 43 are banker numbers that date back to 
March 22 and April 3, 1312. November 22 is an obvious reference to the <em>Pastoralis praeeminentiae</em>
 (Latin for “Pastoral Preeminence”) papal bull issued on November 22, 
1307. This was the first papal bull issued by Pope Clement V following 
the arrests of the Knights Templar in France at dawn on October 13, 
1307. The papal bull ordered the arrest of the Knights Templar and the 
confiscation of their property throughout Christendom.</p>
<p>But on November 22, 1858, Denver Colorado is clearly still under the 
control of the Ћinkers, which is to say, the Freemasons of the South. 
The Civil War does not even start for another three and a half years. So
 why do they found the city on a day of the year that is closely 
associated with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/">long-time foe</a>?
 This question intrigues me. What were they thinking? What was their 
reason for doing this? It sort of reminds me of the actual end date of 
the Maya Long Count on December 16, 2013, five days before the winter 
solstice in that 1307 is five years before 1312 (from which the bankers 
322 and 43 are derived). In other words, for those of you who follow my 
work closely, this is kind of a <em>The Black Hole</em> “course correction” moment in which the Ћinkers are trying to tell us September 23, 2017,—the day of the <em>great wonder</em> discussed on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The “great wonder” in Revelation 12 was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (includes 923 predictive programming)</a>,
—is five years earlier than the actual year of the apocalypse. Another 
thing that grabs my attention is that Sir Francis Bacon was born on 
January 22, 1561. So while 1122 points to the bankers, it incorporates 
the 122 birthday of the man who founded the original Rosicrucians and by
 extension, the Freemasons. But from where I stand as of this writing, 
it’s hard to tell what they were thinking.</p>
<div class="intro">A shared identity</div>
<p>What we do know for sure is that 58 is a reference to Queen Elizabeth
 I. This cannot be overemphasized. The next section discusses what I am 
calling the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings that ends in 2015. 
As you will read in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/#2015">2015</a>
 section below, even the choice of the year 2015 is in memory of Sir 
Francis Bacon’s mother. But after the Civil War in which the Freemasons 
of the South lost control of the country to the Old World bankers (who 
at the time were posing as the European Illuminati), <em>the bankers own Denver, Colorado</em>. Control of the Pikes Peak batholith (discussed in detail on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/batholith/">№ 58. The multi-trillion-dollar granite tunnel system in the Pikes Peak batholith</a>) is the “prize” for which everyone was fighting. This explains 1943 + <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>58</strong></span> = 2001, the choice of the year in which to destroy the World Trade Center. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The bankers are not paying homage to Queen Elizabeth I</em></strong>.</span> They are identifying themselves <em>then</em> and <em>now</em>. The <em>then</em> is their start in life as the Knights Templar and the <em>now</em> is their present home in Denver, Colorado. So the shared identity is 1858, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the year Denver, Colorado was founded</em></strong></span>.</p>

<p>This homepage offers what I consider to be remarkable proof that my 
start and end dates of December 21, 1979 to September 30, 2015 (13, 607 
days) f<em>or the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings</em> are exact, the implications of which are nothing short of profound. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>But 1964 predates the beginning of this period.</em> </strong></span>Why? This is because the 1964 World’s Fare discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/#Why_is_Tomorrowland_all_about_the_1964_New_York_Worlds_Fair"><em>Why is Tomorrowland all about the 1964 New York World’s Fair?</em></a> section on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://amallulla.com/tomorrowland/">№ 22. Tomorrowland cometh</a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>serves as the foundation for the “fireworks finale.”</em></strong></span> It uses the number 58 to point right to 2023.</p>
<div class="impact-108" style="text-align: center;">1965 + <span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span> = 2023</div>
<p>And what was the main symbol of the 1964 World’s Fair, which was used to announce the coming Earth crustal displacement? <em>Why the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisphere#Symbolism_and_media" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Unisphere</a> of course.</em>
 That being the case, you would expect the Ћinkers to be using some 
highly symbolic numbers in the design of the “world’s largest globe.”</p>

<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">13 stories tall</div>
<p>Here too you must recall that 43 is the 14<sup>th</sup> prime number,
 so 140 feet or 43 meters being 13 stories tall is packed with meaning. 
And now you know why this thing is so tall and tilted to 23.5°. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>It’s screaming end of the world</strong></em></span> (in 58 years).</p>
<div class="intro">.223 Remington</div>
<p>I normally characterize the bankers as being oblivious to what the 
Ћinkers are doing, not because they are stupid, but rather because they 
are just too busy preparing for the coming Earth crustal displacement. 
But this 2022 – 1964 = 58 equation is rather in your face, and the 
bankers had a few years to figure it out. How did they respond? 1964 was
 the year they started producing the .223 Remington cartridge used in 
the M16 rifle carried by U.S. soldiers ever since.</p>
<div class="impact-72-red" style="text-align: center;">.223 Remington: ammo of the end time.</div>
<p>Failing to fully understand and appreciate the significance of numbers to the progeny of Jove, <em>particularly the number 322 to the bankers</em>,
 you will overlook subtle clues that we are living in the end time. Ever
 since the year of the 1964 World’s Fair which was so critical to the 
making of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220315183417/http://tomorrowland/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tomorrowland</em></a>
 movie (the last end-time warning for the masses), from Vietnam to 
Desert Storm and Afghanistan, countless millions of people have been 
killed or maimed by a bullet so carelessly named that it rivals the 
Apollo program as a sure sign that we are the last generation before the
 end unless, of course, you think developing a rifle cartridge that just
 so happened to have a caliber (caliber is actually the groove diameter 
of the bore) that is 322 backward was mere coincidence. The naming of 
this ammunition is what I can only describe as <em>reckless abandon</em>, no different than the Apollo program itself. The bankers know we are close to the end, and they are acting accordingly. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>They
 have killed countless millions of Vietnamese, Iraqi, and Afghanistan 
men, women, and children with a bullet that carried their signature as 
surely did the World Trade Center before it was destroyed.</em></span></strong>
 And if they were this careless in the decades leading up to the end, 
what might we expect in the coming months? These are perilous times.</p>
