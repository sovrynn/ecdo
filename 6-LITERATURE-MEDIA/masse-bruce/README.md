Comet impact around 2807 BCE.

Page 5: Using the Velikovskian-like near-Earth approach of an object larger than the Moon, Patten modeled the effects of this hypothesized object as creating the Biblical Great Flood at around 2800 BC. Pellegrino, likewise, focuses attention on the 2800 BC date for the Biblical Flood, although he views it as a regional rather than a global catastrophe.

Page 11: In many sets of cultural traditions, the Flood is identified as the last in a sequence of global catastrophes. Although other more recent catastrophes are noted in some sets of cultural traditions, these are usually defined as being of less magnitude than the Flood. Likewise, although some sets of cultural traditions discuss worldwide cataclysms prior to the Flood, the Flood is generally viewed as the last such cataclysm and therefore initiated the present age or era in which we now live.

Page 12: It is of some interest to note that Chinese myths indicate that the Flood event occurred at the end of the life of Nu Wa, consort of first Chinese emperor Fsu Hsi (2953 - 2838 BC according to standard chronologies), and who herself allegedly lived until about the year 2810 BC.

Page 12: I fully discuss elsewhere the Flood mythology, the nature of my analyses of these data, cosmic impact modeling, and the nature of supporting palaeo-climatic data, such as that palynology, geomorphology, and from absolute chronological referents such as the Bristlecone pine tree-rings. I do not wish to repeat this information
