## Were the Ice Ages Caused by True Polar Wandering?

It was during my undergraduate or graduate work toward my degree in geology and geophysics that I first noticed that the majority of Northern Russia, Siberia and Northern Alaska were never fully glaciated during recent Ice Ages. In fact the areas where the last continental ice sheets persisted formed a nearly perfect ‘Arctic circle’ around a pole centered over Greenland.

The more I puzzled over this, the odder it seemed to me that the earth could be cold enough during the ice age for arctic ice to extend to 50 degrees south of the present Arctic Circle and into parts of Illinois and Germany (literally half way to the equator), and yet parts of Alaska and Siberia which are within the present arctic circle were never covered by continental ice sheets or glaciers!

How could this be? For years I’ve searched for a believable answer, always finding the same unconvincing response thrown out. “Siberia & Alaska were an arctic desert, and because of their distance from the sea — storm cells could not carry moisture far enough inland to those areas.” A pretty terrible response in my opinion considering the exact same “arctic desert” conditions would have existed over the 8,000 feet of ice in Central Canada during the Pleistocene, and even currently exist in the center of Antarctica and yet there’s still upwards of 10,000 feet of ice there today! (more on that later) If there’s one thing Antarctica teaches us, its that ice sheets still form in ‘Arctic deserts’ or regions where very little snow falls. It seems in the long run, continental ice sheets have a lot less to do with annual snowfall totals, and a lot more to do with temperatures being low enough to limit melting. More sophisticated answers involving anticyclones, Hadley cells in the jet stream driven by particular ocean currents and intercontinental rain shadows have been offered but are all equally implausible when examined closely. Is there perhaps a more convincing explanation for the geometry of the Pleistocene ice caps?

# GPT Summary of the Document

This document discusses a controversial geological theory linking the Earth’s ice ages to a phenomenon called "True Polar Wander" (TPW). The author, Lance Weaver, challenges conventional explanations for ice ages, proposing that the Earth’s geographic north pole has periodically shifted due to TPW. This shift, rather than Milankovitch cycles or other commonly cited factors like ocean currents and atmospheric conditions, might better explain the peculiar patterns of glaciation observed during the Pleistocene Epoch.

## Key Points of the Article:

### 1. **Unusual Glacial Patterns**
- Observes that areas like Siberia and Alaska, currently within the Arctic Circle, lacked extensive glaciation during the last ice age.
- Regions much farther south were covered in ice, which is inconsistent with prevailing theories attributing glaciation to moisture availability or atmospheric circulation.

### 2. **True Polar Wander as a Hypothesis**
- TPW refers to the gradual reorientation of the Earth's solid outer shell relative to its rotational axis, caused by imbalances in the planet's mass distribution.
- Suggests that TPW may have relocated the geographic north pole closer to Greenland during the Pleistocene, explaining the asymmetric distribution of ice sheets.

### 3. **Limitations of Conventional Explanations**
- Existing theories attribute glaciation to Milankovitch cycles (variations in Earth’s orbit and axial tilt), ocean currents, and atmospheric dynamics.
- Critiques these models for their inability to fully account for the extent and geometry of Pleistocene ice sheets.

### 4. **Scientific Context and Challenges**
- TPW is a well-documented phenomenon in geological history, but its occurrence on timescales short enough to impact Pleistocene ice ages remains highly controversial.
- Calls for a reconsideration of uniformitarian (gradual change) versus catastrophist (rapid change) interpretations of Earth's geologic processes.

### 5. **Broader Implications**
- If TPW is indeed a driving factor in ice ages, it could reshape our understanding of Earth’s climate history and its sensitivity to external and internal forces.
- This theory also intersects with debates about climate change, as past shifts in the Earth's poles might offer insights into modern climatic patterns.

## Overall Themes
The article combines geological observations, historical debates, and modern scientific tools, such as paleomagnetic reconstructions, to build a case for TPW as a plausible mechanism. It addresses public misconceptions about glacial distributions and highlights gaps in current scientific understanding. However, the discussion remains under construction, with several areas requiring further elaboration and evidence to support the proposed model.
