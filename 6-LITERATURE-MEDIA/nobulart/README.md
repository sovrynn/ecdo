A close follower of the ECDO theory with a lot of relevant material on his [website](https://nobulart.com/). Has also created several excellent ECDO rotation visualizations which are embedded throughout the repo.

## Rotation Speed 2D Viz

ECDO // Relative Velocity Map presented as azimuthal equidistant projections, light and dark versions [1] centred on the ECDO Euler (pivots) at 0°N, 59°W and 0°N, 121°E. Average relative velocities are expressed in kilometres per hour for a 104° rotation, according to distance from the nearest pivot, and the duration of the rotation (anywhere from 6-24 hours in this calculation). 

A rotation would involve acceleration and deceleration - a parabolic curve - suggesting that the shear-forces between land, water and crust would be dispersed over the period of the rotation. It would take some time to reach, exceed, and the drop back down below these averages. These numbers provide a rough guide only. Variations in geography would dramatically influence local conditions in many places. The ECDO hypothesis is described at [2].

I use boxySVG for most of the layout and compositing. It’s nimble and efficient for most tasks.

## Time portents

"Trivial omens give warning of trivial events, but the momentous historical events that attend the birth of a greater cycle in time are preceded by phenomena of a portentous nature, through which the least observant can scarcely fail to become aware of impending change."

## Thirty-Five Centuries Ago

In 1923–29, thirty-three miles north of Vero, in Melbourne, Florida, another such association of human remains and extinct animals was found, “a remarkably rich assemblage of animal bones, many of which represent species which became extinct at or after the close of the Pleistocene [Ice Age] epoch.” The discoverer, J. W. Gidley, of the United States National Museum, established unequivocally that in Melbourne – as in Vero – the human bones were of the same stratum and in the same state of fossilization as the bones of the extinct animals. And again human artifacts were found with the bones… But these conclusions require that the Ice Age ended only twenty-five to thirty-nine centuries ago.

## Heliobiology reccomendations

This is a small sample from over a hundred years of heliobiology research, Alexander Chizhevsky being considered the "father" of this science. 

Guy Beaujouan was also a pioneer in this field. I'm in the process of translating a portion of his L'Histoire et ses Méthodes (https://nobulart.com/media/9782072430787.pdf) which is a volume from the Encyclopédie de la Pléide. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die_de_la_Pl%C3%A9iade) Heliobiology has been heavily suppressed in both the west, and in Russia. Chizhevsky was even imprisoned for some years because his work threatened the 'omnipotent' optic of the communist regime at the time. He is today considered to be a Russian hero.

## The study of cycles

The Study of Cycles (https://nobulart.com/the-study-of-cycles/)
"The main manifestation of solar activity is the appearance of sunspots: powerful magnetic poles, they act as true particle accelerators. Electrons and positive ions projected to the surface of the earth are thus the cause of various electromagnetic disturbances which are capable of periodically influencing meteorology, crops, epidemics, crowd psychology, and consequently the course of history." - Guy Beaujouan (1961)

## South African Oppenheimers

“Robert Oppenheimer was a part of the Oppenheimer financiers that enabled the Rothschilds.” False. They’re not related at all. They only share a name. I know this because I have traced the lineage of the South African Oppenheimer family (https://nobulart.com/diamonds) all the way back to Solomon. They are of the Davidic line. During that process I also looked at RJO’s lineage specifically because I thought he was related. He does not share this lineage in any way or form. Oppenheimer is a popular surname. They’re not all blood relatives.

Not my authorship on this one, but I feel that Joe Vialls made some valid points in this.

## East and West

In the tomb of Senmut, the architect of Queen Hatshepsut, a panel on the ceiling shows the celestial sphere with the signs of the zodiac and other constellations in “a reversed orientation” of the southern sky.

The end of the Middle Kingdom antedated the time of Queen Hatshepsut by several centuries. The astronomical ceiling presenting a reversed orientation must have been a venerated chart, made obsolete a number of centuries earlier.

“A characteristic feature of the Senmut ceiling is the astronomically objectionable orientation of the southern panel.” The center of this panel is occupied by the Orion-Sirius group, in which Orion appears west of Sirius instead of east. “The orientation of the southern panel is such that the person in the tomb looking at it has to lift his head and face north, not south.” “With the reversed orientation of the south panel, Orion, the most conspicuous constellation of the southern sky, appeared to be moving eastward, i.e., in the wrong direction.”

The real meaning of “the irrational orientation of the southern panel” and the “reversed position of Orion” appears to be this: the southern panel shows the sky of Egypt as it was before the celestial sphere interchanged north and south, east and west. The northern panel shows the sky of Egypt as it was on some night of the year in the time of Senmut.
