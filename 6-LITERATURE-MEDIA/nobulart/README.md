# Nobulart

A close follower of the ECDO theory with a lot of relevant material on his [website](https://nobulart.com/). Has also created several excellent ECDO rotation visualizations which are embedded throughout the repo.

## Rotation Speed 2D Viz

ECDO // Relative Velocity Map presented as azimuthal equidistant projections, light and dark versions [1] centred on the ECDO Euler (pivots) at 0°N, 59°W and 0°N, 121°E. Average relative velocities are expressed in kilometres per hour for a 104° rotation, according to distance from the nearest pivot, and the duration of the rotation (anywhere from 6-24 hours in this calculation). 

A rotation would involve acceleration and deceleration - a parabolic curve - suggesting that the shear-forces between land, water and crust would be dispersed over the period of the rotation. It would take some time to reach, exceed, and the drop back down below these averages. These numbers provide a rough guide only. Variations in geography would dramatically influence local conditions in many places. The ECDO hypothesis is described at [2].

I use boxySVG for most of the layout and compositing. It’s nimble and efficient for most tasks.
