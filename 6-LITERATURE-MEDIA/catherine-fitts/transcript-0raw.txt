The US economy and financial system is the leader globally and laundering dirty money.I said to this
wonderful group, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the Lantern.And if you push that
button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking tomorrow.Who here will push the button?
0:16And out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess how many would push
the button?I don't know 1 you suggested.The control grid is in part designed to manage the
population.So if you want to move people to a much lower, more economic footprint, having
complete control is obviously very.
0:33Convenient.So the bottom line is the majority is about to get a lot poorer.So the question is,
where's all this money going?And one of the things I've looked at is the underground base and city
infrastructure and transportation system that's been built.What would be the purpose?I think if you're
worried about a near extinction event.
1:12So thank you for doing this.You get, and I know you worked on this for years, but you get the
sense if you're just a sort of aware person, that there is a concerted attempt by governments around
the world to digitize commerce and to digitize currency and to basically control people through
money, Correct?
1:34That's correct.OK, So that was my first question.Is this happening?Am I imagining it?It's
absolutely happening, and what's important to understand, it's been happening for a long time.In
other words, this is like a, an invisible corral that's, that they've been building around you for a long,
long time 'cause the, you know, how do a few sneak up on the many?
1:54Well, you have to do it very quietly, invisibly before you throw the trap.So, so essentially what
they're building, because it's converting a currency system into a control system.So it's really the end
of currency.And, and what they're doing is they've been building the different digital pieces and when
it integrates and comes together, then you literally have a digital concentration camp.
2:19It's complete and utter control.Otherwise known as the world.It's here's the thing to
understand.We, you and I, grew up in a world where there was mass media, where you were
pitching stories, you know, so you had 57 varieties ice cream and you're pitching them to 57 different
niches, but you're still pitching to mass audiences.
2:39What we're talking about is a system where you can surveil, control and influence one person at
a time.And with AI and software, each person can have their custom surveillance, influence, nudging
and control system and punishment.
2:57Yes, enforcement.Because ultimately, if you control money, you can starve people to death.You
can kill them.Right.So go back and think of the pandemic.So if I say you can't go more than a mile
from your home, and I say you can't, you have to be mandated A pharmaceutical, then if you don't
take the pharmaceutical, I can turn off your money.
3:20If you go more than a mile away from your home, your money and your credit cards won't
work.So if you know, whatever rules I lay down, there's a wonderful, wonderful example.The head of
the Bank of International Settlements is the Central Bank of central banks and it's been running the
process to implement basically an all digital monetary system.
3:44And they have innovation hubs all over the world.They've been running this process for a long
time.And in 2020, when the pandemic started, or it was October 2020, so the pandemic was
underway, the general manager of the Bank of International Settlements was on an IMF panel.
4:01And in one minute, it's the first time in my life I ever saw a central banker tell the truth.I fell off my
chair.And he said, you know, the beauty of this is we can set the rules on how your money works,
and we have the technology to enforce them.
4:19And what he was saying is literally from one place in, you know, anywhere in the world where the
technology exists, you can track each person individually.You can set a, a complex list of rules, you
know, like legislation, regulation and administrative policy.
4:38And you can enforce them all with the technology, with AI and software.So have you ever seen,
there's a wonderful movie called the The Lives of Others about the German Stasi and
surveillance?It's about a group of artists and sort of creative, talented people who are under
surveillance by the German Stasi, and you see what it's like to be under surveillance for 24/7.
5:02Think of each one of us.We're all under surveillance, not just by governments, but by
corporations who are trying to do something.And it may not be anything nefarious.So 80 different
companies are trying to sell you something or 80 different companies are trying to get your data for
some reason.
5:20And, and so they have AI and software bots that track you and follow you and learn from you
and try and influence what you do because they're trying to extract some kind of value from you.And
literally think of, you know, being attacked by a swarm of bees.
5:36We're surrounded now by a swarm of AI software bots all trying to learn from us, extract
something from us or get us to do something.Now when you go to an all digital system, then there's
no escape.
5:52And then they can start literally to enforce rules.They do now so.So what are the manifestations
of this that maybe we're not paying attention to or don't perceive for what they are?So look at what
they did to the Canadian truckers.We don't like what you're doing.
6:07We cut off your money and we cut off your friends money.And if people help you, we cut off their
money too.So I've had, I've known so many different people around the country who've been
debanked.We just got legislation passed in Tennessee that a bank over a certain size couldn't
debank someone for political or religious reasons.
6:25You know, and, and you're, you're one of the things that's happened.There's no such
federal.Law.Not that I know of, but I haven't.I've been working with the states because ultimately the
the one power currently under the Constitution in the United States that can stop this The powers not
delegated to the federal government by the states are reserved to the states.
6:48In other words, the states are technically more powerful than the federal government, and under
the Constitution, they have the power to override the federal government on many different issues,
including healthcare.And so one of the tensions we see in America is more and more there is a
debate between the feds and and the states about who has what power.
7:11So we've seen a lot of the conservative AGS and treasurers pushing back in a, in a wonderful
way, in a marvelous way.The challenge they have is this, and this was said to me by a senator in
northern Ohio.
7:26Northern Ohio has one of the best groups of sort of freedom fighting legislators in the
country.And as you probably know, 'cause you know, Montana, it's very beautiful and you're talking
about Montana, Idaho, Idaho.So, so, but it's right, you know, it's right next to Montana.
7:42So one of the Idaho senators said to me, he said, my problem, every time I fight to implement the
Constitution, he said what I learn is the every year we send a dollar to Washington and every year
Washington sends back $1.19.
7:58And when I say I want to implement the Constitution, my constituents say to me, I'd rather have
the $0.19.So what we've been watching literally since World War 2 is the federal government and a
very, you know, largess, both monetary and fiscal policy, buying people out of the Constitution and
buying the whole federal.
8:20I mean, the federal government is right now.So operating so far outside the law, it's, you know,
you know how unbelievable it is.So that's the challenge before us.If we want to be free, you know,
we're going to have to decide.We're not going to let ourselves be.
8:37You know, it's, it's like being sort of walked into the slaughterhouse.We're not going to walk into
the slaughterhouse and.But you don't even I I guess what bothers me about it, There's something
wonderfully straightforward, horrifying, but wonderfully straightforward about just a conventional
invasion where people show up with guns and tell you what to do because at least you know who
the enemy is.
8:55But there's something very scary in an insidious way about being lulled into slavery.Right.And
the thing to understand about the lulling is the lulling.The marketing plan works one person at a
time.In other words, you know, you, I buy with money, your friend, I buy by knocking them off or the
other, you know, your other friend, I, I get a control file on.
9:20So there are thousands of different ways of nudging, buying carrots and sticks to get everybody
into the control and into the trap.And, and what is so insidious about this is much of the marketing
plan is invisible and it's, and it really is crafted 1 by 1.
9:40The odds seem overwhelming against the average person in a system that you just
described.So how far are we from not being able to exercise constitutional freedoms?So I don't know
how many years.They're clearly pushing to have this done by 20-30.
9:59And you know, what I do have to say is if you look at what it takes to stop it, I believe they're
going to fail.Now, what I don't underestimate is how much damage they could do.And the you know,
the failure may not come in time to save America, so.
10:16If we could just stop and define terms, who's they?The central bankers, yes, right.So we have a
Democratic Republic, or we have a Republic and use this democratic process.What happened in
1913 is the bankers took control of monetary policy.
10:34What they're trying to do now is take control of fiscal policy.Once they get control of fiscal policy,
it's going to be much harder to reverse it.Can you?I'm going to ask a series of really dumb
questions.I hope you'll indulge me.What's the difference?Taxation without representation.
10:50But between fiscal and monetary policies.OK.Monetary policy is I control the process by which
currency is issued, including through so.So I generally govern and control credit issuance and and
and from that the currency, the creation and management of the currency.
11:10Fiscal policy is when I control the taxes and the borrowing of the US government.Now, because
the central bank basically operates the borrowing, you know, it's the the borrowing shared.But this
comes down as the, you know, this is the Boston Tea Party moment.
11:27Can they tax without representation?So I'll give you a little story.During the Biden
administration, Biden nominated somebody for control of currency who was ultimately not
approved.The Republicans in the Senate killed the nomination before she was nominated, 3 weeks
before she wrote an article in the Vanderbilt Law Review that said the great thing about central bank
digital currency, in other words, an all digital currency system, is you have the perfect tool to deal
with inflation.
11:58If inflation gets out of hand, you just freeze everybody's bank accounts.Nice.Right, right,
right.You know, so it's it's so.Inflation is a creation of monetary It's at the effect of monetary policy.
12:14It's like something that somebody did to you.Well, there are two things that cause inflation.So
one is monetary policy, managing monetary policy in a way that creates and monetary inflation.But
you also have, and we're going through it now what I call deglobalization, where you have real
increases in the cost of goods.
12:37So my cost of goods are going up.And it's not because they're issuing, you know, too much
currency relative to growth.It's because we are reversing globalization.Globalization created a whole
lot of lower costs for a variety of reasons.
12:52So if you had a severing of supply chains, for example, that would cause inflation because it
just cost more to get the materials in the goods.Right.And, and it's not just higher prices, it's, you
know, some products, a lot of products stop being economic and just go away.So, you know, when
you hiccup supply chains, especially if you do it by shock doctor or shock and all, which is what
we're watching now, you know, it wrecks havoc.
13:17So think of it like a a flotilla of ships that need to turn.If the aircraft terrier doesn't let everybody
know they're turning, then the the boats aren't ready to turn.And you have boats smashing into each
other.You.Sink a lot of ships.You sink a lot of ships.
13:34So leaving aside whether that was wise or not, that's what we're doing.Right.So you get inflation
out of that.Of course, you're absolutely right.If if oil prices go up, you get inflation.Right.And that
deglobalization started in the financial crisis.So, you know, so it's accelerating now, but it's not that
we just started it.
13:52How did it start during in 2008?Yes, yes.Because why?Because for several reasons, but one is
we were trying to exercise more and more control through the dollar system.And we've always
exercised a lot of power and control and and extracted A subsidy from the dollar system.
14:13But you have more and more people trying to get out of the system and the financial crisis that
first the Asian crisis in 97 was a real wake up to Asia.You know, you, you need to create more
resiliency.But more and more things happened.
14:29And then in 2008, it started to accelerate with the creation of the, you know, as the BRICS
started to organize and work to sort of pull out of the.The idea was you've got a world economy
based on the dollar.The people who issue and administer the dollar are not running things
responsibly.
14:45Therefore, we need a separate safe haven.They're the people running the dollar system want a
unipolar model. the US wants a unipolar model.And we don't want to be part of a unipolar model
because we don't want, if you look at the level of subsidy they're extracting, we don't want that level
of, of subsidy extracted.
15:07And if you look at some of the rules and regulations, we don't want to be a part of it.So we in
India, the the I don't know if you ever saw one of the greatest explanations of globalization ever
given.Sir James Goldsmith came to the United States in 1994 and he did an interview with Charlie
Rose and he described why we should never approve the Uruguay Round of Gatt and institute the
WTO.
15:32And he to this day, he nailed nailed it perfectly if.You could summarize his argument.What
would it be?He said.We are going to hollow out the middle class in the West and we are going to
devastate our culture, ultimate culture, yes, our culture.
15:52We're going to devastate our culture and we're going to devastate the quality of the food
supply.He said that.Yes, so now those are my words of way of saying it.You should watch it.And I I
think to this day, I think it's the best description.
16:08And, and if you read my online book and you listen to Sir James Goldsmith, what they both
describe as the fact we knew we knew what we were.In other words, the leadership knew how that
this would destroy or devastate the West.So why'd they do it?
16:26That's the $64,000 question.I think they.Hate the West, Defenders of the West, I don't.Think, I
think one of the reasons they did it, it's I think they wanted to create the capacity and centralized the
capital they needed to go into space.
16:45And I think they knew that they would need, every 100 or so years the central bankers do a
reset.And I think they knew they were coming into a reset and, and they felt with this technology that
they, you know, if they didn't globalize, someone else would and, and they wanted to control the
process.
17:05They needed the money to go into space, The capital.Well, I don't even know what that
means.So I think they wanted to build the capacity to become a multi planetary
civilization.Really.Yeah.Spring and summer are here.
17:22That's good news.It means you get to go outside and frolic in the sunshine.Unfortunately,
there's a downside.Burglars are psyched for the longer days.It means fewer people are home, and
that gives them more chances to break in and steal your stuff.This is not our imagination.
17:38FBI crime data backs it up.More daylight means more burglaries.That's bad, but there is a
solution.You can leave your house feeling secure with SimpliSafe.This is a really cool idea.Millions of
Americans use this.It's the highest standard in home security.
17:55You get Peace of Mind every time you leave.So a traditional burglar alarm system of the kind
maybe you already have only sets off when someone has already broken into your house.That's not
good.Smashed a window?Come to the basement door, whatever.SimpliSafe prevents intrusions
before they happen and does it with AI powered cameras and live professional agents.
18:15Monitoring it leaves nothing to chance.Plans for SimpliSafe start around a dollar per day so it's
not crazy expensive at all.Visit simplisafethatssimplisafe.com/tucker and get 50% off a new system

18:32You get your first month for freethatssimplisafe.com/tucker.There was no safe like
SimpliSafe.Man, I was caught up in such minutiae in 1994.I never heard anybody say that.I had no
idea that was happening.So I became, I didn't become convinced of that in 1994, I became
convinced.
18:49Were you still working for the federal government in 94?My company was the lead financial
advisor for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and I was trying to clean up the
mortgage corruption and what I ran smack into is that they were clearly and intentionally setting up
the infrastructure to dramatically increase mortgage fraud.
19:12Intentionally mortgage fraud is a public private partnership between the New York Fed member
banks and the, and the federal government.So, so the Treasury and the Fed were clearly
engineering a massive new mortgage bubble.And essentially I was doing a series of things and, and
that mortgage bubble was going to centralized capital and I was working on a whole plan coming out
of the Bush administration.
19:37We were taking all our profits and investing in building a software infrastructure that would help
communities decentralize political and economic power, but in a way that would create new great
wealth.And one of the projects we had was we were working with, I had a subsidiary that had a, a
project working with the top pension fund leaders in the country.
20:02And, and essentially our job was to figure out how the pension funds could invest so that they
could handle this baby boomer demographic going through the pension and retirement system.And,
and, and how we could do it, how they could invest their money 'cause they're operating at such a
size that it would be good for America.
20:24You know, how do you build a stronger America in a way that helps the baby boomers, you
know, live in retirement?And I made a presentation in the spring of 1997 to we were at a big money
management firm outside of Pennsylvania.
20:42And one of the board members was a money manager who worked with a lot of the pension
funds.And so we had all these top corporate and state pension fund leaders.And I made a
presentation, we had done a simulation of re engineering the Philadelphia economy to achieve this.
20:58And the top pension fund leader looked at me and he said, Oh my God, you know, this is very
similar to what we tried long ago and it didn't work.And I said you didn't have the Internet, you didn't
have the tools to get the average person's learning metabolism high enough, you know, on an
economic basis to do that.
21:17We had built a data servicing company in low income communities and we were able to show
how easily we could get the labor force or people on welfare off of welfare and make making lots of
money and being very productive at high speed.And and he looked at me and he said, you don't
understand, It's too late.
21:35I said, what do you mean it's too late?He said, they've given up on the country.They're moving
all the money out starting in the fall.He said, you've got to get to Nick Brady.Nick had been my, I had
been a partner at Dylan Reed and Nick had been the chairman of Dylan Reed before he became
secretary of treasury.And at that point Nick is out, but you know, sort of involved.
21:55Anyway, he said, you, you've got to get to Nick and let him know it's not hopeless.This can all
be turned around and and I thought he meant we, the pension funds have been instructed to
reinvest equity and reallocate our equity into the emerging markets, which made sense because
they had a much higher growth rate.
22:14What I didn't realize then was, and I realized shortly thereafter, in October of 1997, that's the
beginning of the 1998 fiscal year, huge, enormous amounts of money started go started
disappearing from the US government.
22:31And literally by the time of 911, there was 4.1 trillion missing from DoD and HUD.And if you
remember the day before 911, Donald Rumsfeld stood up and, and basically said he, he did a press
conference and he said there's 2.3 trillion in undocumentable adjustments last year at DoD and
we're missing money.
22:54And it's, you know, it's worse than terrorism.And then of course, I was working with a report on
a huge story that would have published that Friday after 911 about the missing money.We've been
working on it for over a year.And she'd done 9 stories.I'd helped her do 9 stories because we were
trying to get the General Accounting Office.
23:13Now that now they call it to the General Accountability Office.But we, we were trying to get both
Congress and the GAOGAO to do something about it and to try and stop it.And anyway, as you
know.Yeah, priorities changed, right?
23:30And for reasons that we still don't understand and.Oh, I understand.Yeah.Well, well, I don't think
the average person, the average person I think sort of thinks, well, maybe there were 19 guys
from.Well, but here's.Saudi or something?I call the Patriot Act the the control and concentration of
cash flow Act because what one of the things that happened after 911.
23:51If you, if you look at the history of the black budget, the sort of secret financing that the
government uses for secret and classified projects, that pot of money had grown and grown and
grown and it, it had become very dysfunctional to try and get that money.Mortgage fraud to I believe
was one of the biggest sources.
24:10And that's why what I was doing sort of went into the heart of the problem.But the Patriot Act
and that whole process was very successful at moving a lot more money on to the budget.
24:26In other words, it made it much easier to get enormous amounts of money for the national
security state as a result of what happened.Now, you know, whenever you do an operation like this,
you stack functions.So it's only one of many goals, but it was very successful.
24:42We went all went right over my head.I thought it was all about Muhammad Atta.I had no idea.I
know you're laughing.I want to tell you my church story.Wait, hold on.There's so many threats
here.Yeah, there's a lot of threats.Yeah, there's a lot of threats.I just want to, I don't want to let it
continue to hang in the air of this question of space.
25:00You sort of threw that out parenthetically, but like what?I've never heard that before.So you
believe going back 30 years that people in the US government and in the finance world wanted
money?For yeah, it wasn't U.S. government, it was the central banking.If you look at the, if you look
at the group of people who meet through the BIS, what's that?
25:19The bank, The BIS, is the Bank of International Settlements and it's the central Bank of central
banks.Where is that located?It's in Basel, Switzerland, and it has 63 of the most powerful central
banks as its members, and the New York Fed and the Fed are both shareholders.
25:36They became shareholders in 1994.In one sentence, what's the what's the purpose of the Bank
of International Settlements?OK, so there are two things you need to know about the Bank of
International Settlements.I'm not sure my brain's big enough for this, but keep.Going it is OK, it has
sovereign immunity.What does that mean?
25:53It's above the law.It's its own country.Right.It's its own country.It has its own police force.And
essentially, other than one of its staff being in a car accident or, you know, minor things, no one has
the legal authority to move against it.OK.
26:09And a sovereign immunity.That's number one.Number two, it can move money and hold it on its
bank, on its balance sheet and manage money secretly.So if I want to, I'm, and I'm grossly
oversimplifying, if I want to steal 21 trillion from the US government and park it on the balance sheet
of the BIS, it can move it anywhere in the world and it can keep it on its balance sheet secretly.
26:37Why would there be an organization?But first of all, where does its power like who empowered
it to have sovereign immunity in the?It was created after World War One and and, and sort of
collected its powers and got going in the 30s.And it was created in theory to manage the reparations
of the German government.
26:56But if you read the real history, it was because the Bank of England and the central bankers
wanted an entity that had sovereign immunity.They wanted to be able to move money secretly.So for
example, if you look at what happened during World War 2 and all the money that was moving back
and forth between the Germans and Americans, you know, Dulles was over in Switzerland helping to
match these all these transfers back and forth.
27:21So there's a wonderful book called the Tower of Basel by a wonderful Hungarian journalist
where he documents and describes the whole history of the Bank of International Settlements.And if
you want to understand power in this world, understanding the how the Bank of International
Settlements and the and the plumbing of the central banking system works is very, very important.
27:44I've always been worried that if I knew more that I would become mentally ill.No, no.So I just
have to say that reality is sort of the door that you open to find real solutions.So there are real
solutions and and the biggest obstacle to implementing them is nobody wants to face it.
28:06So you used to have a pass through.Nobody wants to face the truth of how.Things happen to
face the truth, and I understand that because the hardest thing I ever had to do, Tucker, was look in
the mirror and say I'm the Patsy.I was the assistant secretary of housing.I didn't know and I went
along and I didn't face this.
28:23I should have seen this faster.I should have say I'm the Patsy and it was it.It's sometimes it's
harder than facing death to admit that you've been part of, you know, a big lie and you've been
tricked.As someone who advocated for the Iraq war on television, I I've lived this to some.
28:41Extent no.Yes, I did.Well, you know, you, the part of facing this is you have to forgive
yourself.You really have to.But I used to have a pastor who would say if we can face it, God can fix it
because you have to understand we can't fix it.There are many, many things we can do to change
the course.
29:00And I believe ultimately freedom can prevail and there's many things we can do to help that
happen.But ultimately, this is a spiritual war and you have to call on God, you have to call on the
divine, and that's where the battle is ultimately going to be decided.
29:18And that means literally, I believe this is true.The divine intelligence cannot go to work unless
we're willing to face it.You know, we have to look at it.We have to pray, we have to ask for help, and
we have to deal with it.And the solutions, the real solutions will be cultural.
29:36There'll be millions of people acting in their own life, refusing to be controlled, you know,
individually so.Very, very wise what you just said, I think it's true and and thank you for saying that.I
want to just go one more time to the space question.
29:53So you said that people with power at the central banks decided that we need to sort of
colonize space or move towards space.Did that happen?So here's what happened and we have two
wrap ups and I think I sent them to you.
30:11One is we published in 2015 called Space here we go and it's got a picture of a businessman,
you know, taking off in a spaceship.And then we in 2017 after a couple of the big investment banks
wrote big things about space investment, we wrote one called the Space based economy.
30:30And then we we tracked space on Solaire report.So I would refer you to that, but I think I think,
you know, first of all, you've seen a lot of capital centralized into a few billionaires who then reinvest
that money in space.
30:51So Musk, Bezos, you know, so clearly there's a centralization of capital and a reinvestment.So
the idea of space is what I mean.Just biggest possible picture.Why would you be interested in
space?I'd say this is someone who's not.
31:07Right.So, so let me give you a couple reasons why.First of all, you're looking for the miners are
looking for a variety of different resources.So there are practical reasons if you can get the cost
down that you would want to do asteroid mining.The big one, the big economic one is control is most
easily implemented by satellites.
31:29So you want to put up a whole ring of satellites that combined with telecommunications can
basically help run the control grid and not just the control grid in the West.The control grid, if you're
going to shift huge amounts of money globally, how are you going to track and enforce that your
money is being properly invested?
31:51Well, you need a control grid globally.So I, I think that's part of it.The last thing, and I don't know
the answer to this, is I think there is real concerned about geophysical risks and one way to deal with
that is to make sure we don't bet the ranch on one planet.
32:09So to that, if we could just linger on that.Thank you for that.That'll make sense if we just linger
on one question.So geophysical risks, So we've been lectured for, I don't know, 30 years now about
climate change.Climate change is obviously an ongoing feature of life on this planet.
32:25The glacier is just an OP.So of course it's an OP and I think we, you know, people have figured
that out.But but that doesn't mean that smart, highly informed people aren't worried about
geophysical risks.
32:41They are, and I know some of them.So what do you think those risks are that that honest, smart
people who are interested in self preservation and thriving?Like what are the risks they're worried
about?So I think, I think the first is a solar minimum where you get big drops in the economy and the
agriculture and you can't feed the population, right.
33:02So because there are changes in climate because of the distance of the Earth from the sun,
right?And that changes.Right.So we know throughout history we go through periods of solar
minimum.Solar Minimum is the name.I think it's called solar minimum.I'm not an expert in any of this
so.So they are worried about climate change, but they don't think it's coming from your suburban.
33:22Right.It's not coming from human behavior.Now there there are environmental problems coming
from human behavior and those are right.So, so, so, so that's one.And do you think that risk is real?I
don't know.For the record, I, I, I have one friend who's very well informed, who has convinced me
that that is real, that they're, that they're very concerned about water.
33:46If, if you look at the history, you know, of solar minimums and you look at what it does to, you
know, there was a Russian, I, I can't remember if he's an economist or science that did a lot of
research on the stock market and solar activity, you know, and the, the, if you're the central bankers
and you're in charge of managing the financial system, that that reality would make me very nervous.
34:10So, OK, so I think I, you know, I think there's something there worth understanding.The other
thing is every, it appears to me if you go back through history, every 10,012 thousand years we have,
you know, some kind of huge disaster.
34:26An extinction event.An extinction, a near extinction event.So I don't know if you've ever read the
science fiction book 3 body problem.No, it's fascinating.It's a one of the tops Chinese science fiction
and and it's about.I've read no Chinese science fiction.
34:43OK, I'm feeling very ignorant this morning.No, no, no, no.Because I here's the thing.I'm just
trying to figure out what in the world's going on.Yeah, Amen.We'll start.I'm in the same place.And so
that always, as you know, that always leads you to the most.Does right?It does.
34:59Right.So in one, I think it was, I think the thing that got me to read 3 body problem was Obama
made some cryptic comment about people ought to read this book.It was like, hint, hint, you know,
here are the problems I'm dealing with.And the three body problem is about other bodies that come
into the solar system and you it's there.
35:22It's impossible to predict their trajectory.And then when they do, they create this catastrophic
flooding and earthquakes and all this other stuff anyway.But, but I think that there, whether it's a pole
shift, magnetic pole shift is one of the, you know, theories of what causes these events.
35:42But there is a history of near extinction events.And one of the things that I've looked at,
because I'm trying to figure out, you know, in between 19 fiscal 1998 and fiscal 2015, there were 21
trillion of undocumentable adjustments in the US government.
35:59If you go to our website, missingmoney.slayer.com, we have years and years of documentation,
including the government financials that show this.And so the question is, where is all this money
going?And one of the things I've looked at in the process of looking at where all this money is going
is the underground base and city infrastructure and transportation system that's been built.
36:23And I'm sorry.Yes, so, so we have built an extraordinary number of underground bases and
supposedly transportation systems.Some of these are a record of some of these are documented as
part of the national security infrastructure.
36:40I think there are many more so in.The United States.In the United States on all over the
world.But in from 2021 to 2023, I took one of the smartest subscribers in the Slayer Report network
and he and I spent two years collecting all the data and all the allegations on underground bases.
37:07And then we we systematically went through and tried to estimate our guess.This is totally a
guess of how many underground bases, both underground in the United States, but also
underground under the ocean around the United States.
37:24And our estimate was 170 with the transportation network connecting them.And what would be
the purpose?The purpose if you thought you were going to get a near extinction event, so so they're
to me, they're two purposes.You have so many activities going on that you need to keep secret that
you're basically building the capacity to for example, if you're doing a secret space program, you
need to platform it from, you know, things that can't be seen.
37:53But I think if you're worried about a near extinction event, you know, that's.So I know nothing
about this other than my only window into it.I knew a contractor who worked on one in Washington,
in the city of Washington, DC, and I remember him telling me about a power box, like a transformer
box on Constitution Ave. that he told me because he worked on it personally was actually the exit,
the egress from White House that was kind of by vehicle.
38:26I thought that was when I was like, really?He goes, Oh yeah, no, I, I installed it.I know.And I
thought, well, that's kind of crazy.Then the middle of this big city where I live, I lived in that was on
Constitution Ave.Every day that you could build something like that without me knowing it.Under the
VP's house at the Naval Observatory, same thing.
38:44I think most people know that.Next to my brother's house on Macomb St. in DC.So.Also so like,
but that's, I always thought that was like preparation for nuclear war.Like, I didn't really think about it
that much.Yeah, it's it's preparation for catastrophe.So, but you think that there are facilities like that
in other places outside DC?
39:04Oh yeah.So if you're interested, we have a great interview.I did an interview of Richard Dolan
on underground bases on the Solari report.And it's sort of an introduction to the topic and it's based
on a lot of the research of a guy named Richard Souder, who it's very hard to interview.
39:21So Richard kind of went through all the material and, and you know, clearly it's, I don't know if
you ever saw Washington Post did a, a project, it was in 2010 or 12 called Top Secret America.
39:36And one of the reporters, it was a team of two reporters, one of them put together a database of
all the different top secret installations that had been built in the country, including since the Patriot
Act.And what you saw was just this explosion of money and building so many both underground and
above ground facilities.
39:59Not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies.You probably heard about 8 Sleep by
now.They developed the country's most innovative products for sleep.Almost everybody in our office
uses something they make called the Pod, and they love it.And there's a reason that professional
athletes and lots of other smart people do, too.
40:16You add the pod to your mattress like a mattress cover, and it helps you get a better night's
sleep and filled with vitality at the start of each day.In an intimidating way almost.It's amazing.How
does it do it?Well, it uses advanced technology to track your sleep and automatically adjust the
temperature of your side of the bed to what's perfect for sleep.
40:34And temperature makes all the difference.It's backed by over 600 million hours of data.They've
also used those insights to create their new product, Sleep Elixir, to help you get quiet before you go
to bed, fall asleep faster, and stay knocked out longer.No grogginess, no weird side effects, just
better deep sleep.
40:52So if you're ready to take sleep and recovery to the next level, go to eightsleep.com/tucker to
get 350 bucks off your pod for Ultra.Full refund for 30 days if you don't love it.It works.Just as a
theological matter.
41:07I hate to say this, but I think it's true.If you're building a lot underground, you're on the wrong
side.I just don't.I don't think that's a good sign.So I'll tell you a very funny.Right, like, just like, let's just
the obvious first.
41:23That's not good.So I'll tell you a very funny story.So in after I left the administration, after I left
the Bush administration, I went on the board of Sallie Mae and I'm on the board of Sallie Mae.
41:39And after one of the first meetings, there's a wonderful.Stop.I don't I you've been talking about
underground bases and colonizing space, and you clearly seem totally sane, but I'm sure some
people are like, well, she's obviously crazy.I should have set the stage at the beginning with your
biography.Like you're as mainstream.
41:55You're on the board of Sallie Sallie Mae.You're a partner at Dylan Reed.It's like, right.You're not
just like on the Internet, right?I'm sorry.I just want to say, I just want to say that this is like a former
high level federal official who's on the board of Sallie Mae and a partner, Dylan Reed.
42:13OK, just want to say it out loud.OK, so, so I'm on the board and there was a lovely chairman, a
really lovely guy.And he comes out, he he says, can I talk to you after the meeting?And I said
sure.And he pulls out this big glossy brochure for the Council on Foreign Relations.
42:29And he said the time has come for you to join.And he said we want you to ask Nick.Nick, ready
to sponsor you?And I said to him, you know, Sam, I just don't want to do this.I, I, I just, I, I really don't
want to do this.And he looked shocked.And he said, you don't understand.
42:45If you don't do this, you're out forever.And just at that moment, just at that moment, you know,
it's, it's these moments when things come to you.I saw in my mind, I'm very pictorial.I saw in my
mind a locker in the underground base and they were taking my name off of the locker and I thought,
I thought, you know, if it comes to that, I'll take my chances upstairs, the way to play.
43:12Yeah, me too.And I said, and but it's this, it's a, you know, something.It's at the deepest root.It's
a spiritual and cultural question.Totally agree.Who's cowering underground like in the dark places,
No.There's but to to me, there's nothing wrong with going into a bunker if they're bombing.
43:29OK, you know, I, I don't have a problem with that, but I, I really didn't want to be with all of them
in a concentrated.Space.It was like.No, I'd rather.And you know them at this is you're not guessing at
this like you know a lot of these people.I know a lot of these people, and the one thing I will have to
say, if there's anything I learned from my history, the problem is not they are bad and we are good.
43:54That's not how this works.The evil and the good is threaded at every level of society, every
community, every enterprise.It doesn't work like that.Well, I'm not especially good.I know that.I know
that for a fact.So.I think you're pretty good.
44:09Yeah, but of course you know more about yourself than anyone else does.And I know that what
a flood person I am.So I'll never to declare myself on on, you know, I'll never say God's on my
side.I'll say I want to be on God's side.But it's an open question.Well, it's a journey.
44:25It's never over and and we're not perfect and it's you try every day to do as good as you can,
you know, and it's like baseball, you get some hits some days and some days you strike out.So, but
you believe that there's a whole constellation of underground bases built by the US government in
the United States, like that fact alone, just the physical infrastructure of it, because normally we talk.
44:48About what are they doing they.What's unbelievable and like?It raises lots of practical
questions.How do you ventilate them?What about food and water supply, you know?Where's the
energy?Are we using breakthrough energy or?Where's the energy come?Right, right.Because I'm
sure that we have the ability to, to produce breakthrough energy at very low cost, you know, if you go
back and start.
45:11With that.My Dutch partners I met because they were doing a series of conferences on
breakthrough energy and they brought together breakthrough energy inventors from around the
world.And you know, you can see all the videos up on the Internet and, and really went through the
history from Tesla on of different inventors who have discovered and claimed different innovations
with breakthrough energy.
45:36And I'm convinced that this energy exists.And I'm also convinced if you look at a lot of the really
fast ships, you know, flying around the planet, you know that they, you know, they're not using
classical electricity.
45:51Releasing, right?So, so you know.They're not running in diesel.Right, exactly right.So.Yeah.So
we know that these, I'm sorry, I get so caught up in the details, but we know that there are quite a
number of a large underground bases in the United States.
46:12We can state that as fact.And then the question becomes, of course, like if they're connected to
the power grid, you know, if they're pulling off just to conventional natural gas electricity generation
station, you could like know that and measure it.But you think they have independent energy
sources.
46:28Of course they do.So one of the one of the questions I have that I think is really important is
when you look at breakthrough energy, if you were running the planet.So I have this nickname for
the committee at the top, Mr. Global.
46:44If you were Mr. Global, you would not want to implement breakthrough energy on a widespread
basis for a variety of reasons, one of which is everybody got a hold of it and weaponized it.It could
be very dangerous.Why?My understanding is that literally one small group of people could take this,
you know, with no sovereign powers or, you know, just organized crime and use it in a way that could
weaponize it and make it very dangerous.
47:12I don't, I, I'm not a scientist.I don't really understand.But energy, by definition is dangerous.You
know gasoline is dangerous, right?Right.Electricity is dangerous.Of course nuclear energy is
dangerous.Right.But if you're, if you're, if you're the risk manager and you're in charge of managing
the planet, you know, this has more disruption capability, both weaponization, economic, you know,
suddenly everybody's free to do whatever they want.
47:35And so they're much harder to control.So, so if you're Mr. Global and you have the capacity
dramatically lower the energy cost, the other danger is then population skyrockets and you, you're
concerned about that.So if you're Mr. Global and you're worried about what will happen if you bring
this technology out, it's very convenient to get complete control.
47:59If you don't trust the population to be environmentally responsible or politically responsible, then
complete control.So I have a we have a good mutual friend who's been bothering me for years to
interview you.You've got to interview her.So glad.
48:16Well, just because she's, he said.This is like the best informed, smartest, most reasonable,
mainstream, sane person I know of you.He said this and I was like, yeah, OK, anyway.And we're just
really glad we did this interview because you're blowing my mind up and down.So how convinced
are you that breakthrough energy, alternate forms of energy, non publicly disclosed forms of energy
are in use by the US government?
48:46I think there's a very high chance that that they're in some kind of use in a very controlled,
secret way.Yeah, well, there are tons of indications and you've had a number of people like at the
contractor level, like I'm a federal contractor, electrician or a, you know, concrete guy or whatever.
49:04And I was working on this underground facility.There are a number of people who come forward
to say this and I saw appeared to be some brand new form of energy.I didn't understand right.Insane
people too.Shawn Ryan, who's a friend of mine, wonderful guy, honest man.There's a podcaster
interviewed, did an interview with this guy who was just like a just a random blue collar guy.
49:23I think he was a concrete guy, you know, and he got a call for a million yards of concrete or
whatever and went to this underground facility, DoD facility and saw clearly signs of some energy
source that was, you know, defied the laws of known physics.
49:39So I and there are a bunch of people have said stuff like that.So I don't think.It's crazy.So I have
a, one of, I have two businesses.One is the Solaria report, the other is Solaria screens.I do an
investment screen and I think, you know, a lot has to shift in investment if we're going to have a real
civilization and not misallocate.
49:56I think we're misallocating capital terribly anyway.But he he for 30 years has been an an
investor in a breakthrough energy company.So when you know has been.Yeah, yeah.And, and it's
called Brilliant Light.You can go look at their website, you know, and, and they're really, you know,
they swear they've got it.
50:16And what is it?Don't ask me.Yeah, you got to get him on and.So you think this money has been
taken by people who've really thought through the future and are determined to survive it?
50:33So I think I call it a financial coup.I think what happened was when the budget deal busted in
1995, they gave up on the government.They just said, you know, this form of government will not
work as a governance structure to manage the dollar system.
50:55They're right about that.And, and, you know, they just felt it was impossible.If you're a risk
manager, you got to turn the aircraft carrier before you hit the iceberg.And that could be 20 years
before, do you know what I mean?And they just felt that the system wasn't working and it required to
get consensus.
51:16You just had to dumb people down and buy them off and it just wasn't working.So I think they
decided, OK, we're going to re engineer government on the just do it method.And the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to pull all the money out.We're going to put the government in a debt trap
and then we'll squeeze it and shift to the control model.
51:35And it was a financial coup and it started in fiscal 1998.So it started literally October 1st,
1997.By 2015, they had had 21.We had reports in their financials of 21 trillion of undocumentable
adjustments.
51:51From a cash standpoint, you know, that could be 50, it could be 50 trillion or 10 trillion.There's
no way to tell unless you can get access to the bank records.And then what happened was Doctor
Mark Skidmore of Michigan State University and I published a study, sort of a survey we had done
thanks to him and his students that announced that we were up to the 21 trillion at that point.
52:18Then the next step that happened, remember the Kavanaugh hearings very well, OK.What you
don't remember is during the Kavanaugh hearings, the White House, the Senate, the House
Republican and Democrat, all of them together instituted, issued an administrative policy called
Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board Statement 56.
52:43Yeah, I did miss that.I'll just you.Did miss that.I I was busy watching Kavanaugh yell about his
teenage drinking or whatever.And what that policy said is, as a matter of administrative policy, we do
not have to obey the constitutional provisions related to financial budgeting and disclosure.
53:00We do not have to obey the laws, and we do not have to obey the regulations.What we can do
is appoint a secret group of people by a secret process to move money out of the financial
disclosures of the United States and 150.
53:19So it's the 24 covered agencies plus approximately 150 governmental entities.And when you
throw in the classification laws and the the national security laws, it also applies to the big banks and
contractors working for the US government.
53:37Now let me explain what this means as a matter of investment.When I look at the US large cap
stock market or the US bond market, the Treasury market, I have no financial disclosure that has
any meaning.Everything's secret.I have no idea what it means if I pick up the financials of a New
York Fed member bank that is running the New York, the US Treasury Department's bank accounts,
or if I pick up the Treasury financial statements, they're meaningless.
54:08They don't mean anything.What's missing you can't know.All you can know is a secret group of
people can move whatever it make whatever they want to go missing and you can't know what it
is.It's all secret.So I'm, I'm looking at half the cake, but I don't know what what part of the cake is
missing.
54:29So it it's meaningless.You don't even know if it is half.Right.I, I, I don't it, it's, you know, it, it is
reached a level of absurdity where and, but, but the absurd thing is, as a legal matter, to take the
position that an administrative policy agreed upon by the UNI party can overrule the Constitution,
can overrule the laws and can overrule the regulations simply by, you know, like the, you know, you,
you wave the wand and suddenly magically law doesn't matter.
55:08I mean, now you're talking and, and you also saw this in, in the financial crisis, a decision was
made by Eric Holder in the Department of Justice to not prosecute HSBC.There's a wonderful video
on the best evidence channel by John Titus about this whole thing.
55:24And basically what they said is a systemically important, this is under the BIS, there's a
definition under the BIS, under the Financial Stability Board of a financially systemically important
institution.
55:40These institutions are free to break the law with, No, they're free to break the law.At most, all
they have to do is kick back a piece of the profits to the Department of Justice.So it's like a, a formal
kickback system.And what you're saying is that you're taking the sovereign immunity of the BIS and
through the New York Fed, extending it to the banks that are running these operations?
56:04JP Morgan and the rest.Bank of America, Yeah.Right.So, So what you're, what you've done
with the BIS, the IMF, the World Bank, the UN, you've created all these different organizations.And if
you look at we, we did like 40 in Latin America, you've created an international overlay of
organizations that have various forms of sovereign immunity, of course, the big one being the BIS.
56:31And so if they are free to break the law, I mean, if you if you look at the financial crisis, what
you're saying is these companies can lose trillions of dollars, have it replaced by the taxpayer and
keep on going.So now is the point of the conversation where I have to ask the others question,
which is who are these people?
56:50So can you name some of the people who you believe are making these decisions whose
whose decisions are effectively, as you just said above the law have effective immunity?Sort of who
is Mr. Global and, and my experience is the bureaucracy that that sort of runs things is the central
banking bureaucracy.
57:09So we've described the BIS and the central bankers.So think of the planet as a house.So you
have the house, then you have financing the house, that's the mortgage.Then you have the
insurance.And you know, if you don't have the insurance, then you're then you have the equity in the
house, right?
57:26And and the insurance layer is very, very important to make sure that the equity is protected,
right.OK.So you got the real assets, you've got the banking system, you've got the insurance system
and then you've got the owners.So in my experience, if you go to the BIS and you look at the
systemically important institutions and the members, you know, that's the bureaucracy that runs the
debt and the transaction system.
57:52So the, you know, the transactions because the whole thing depends on being able to swap
and, and transact.The insurance group is very important for the reasons you just described, same as
on your house.And then the question is, who are the real owners?
58:08And that's the mystery.And I've spent my whole life trying to figure out who are the real owners
and basically from what experience I've had, if you know their name, they're not one of the important
owners.Do you know what I mean?It's it's intergenerational pools of capital.
58:26Now, here's what's interesting.One of the most powerful pools of intergenerational capital that
I've ever dealt with is the Harvard endowment.And if you look at the squabble going on over who
controls the Harvard endowment right now, it's a very interesting squabble.
58:42Can you summarize that?Well, you have you have the Trump administration and the
Department of Justice now in a lawsuit with Harvard over who has what powers over Harvard's
policies.But I think the big the big fight is not the, you know, an asymmetrical warfare.
59:03The fight is never what the fight's really about.The real fight is about who controls the so
Harvard Corporation, the university is only a portion of the Harvard Corporation.The Harvard
Corporation runs the university and it runs the endowment.
59:22OK.And the Harvard Corporation, in my experience, is one of the most important investment
syndicates in the world.And because they have a tax exemption, they don't have to pay taxes.They
spin off, I think the last time I looked, I don't know what it is currently, but they spin off about 4% a
year for the university, which is a lot cheaper than paying taxes.
59:42And it's a great investment cause the university provides all sorts of intellectual and human
capital to the investment syndicate, you know, so it's a very brilliant, elegant model.And my theory is
it was the model that was really created to sort of compete with the, the Vatican and the Catholics
who had 2000 years of, you know, diplomatic immunity and no taxes anyway.
1:00:05So, so, But it is.The Harvard Corporation is run by.A perpetuating board, so, so the board
members, if board member leaves, they pick a new board member.So it's a perpetuate self
perpetuating board.And my guess is behind the scenes if there's a fight, one of the fight is who gets
on that board?
1:00:24Because then you control a $50 billion plus endowment and a $50 billion plus endowment,
which now is has a 39% private equity portfolio.And these are, you know, I, I said to on money and
markets, which is our we show, I said the other week, you know, if this is a monopoly board, that
would be Park Place because it's such a flagship in the world of investment.
1:00:47It's such a major leader.What would happen if?The Congress decided to the new tax bill to tax
university endowments.Which they should do.I don't know because because.
1:01:03That will happen at the same time.Something else is going to happen, and these things are
going to happen at the same time.The thing that's going to rock the universities is if you look at how
much money it cost you as a father to put put one child through college, you know, you're talking
about enormous bills.
1:01:28And if you look at how far the universities have gotten away from providing a great education,
it's not a good investment.So when I was an investment advisor, I used to work with my clients kids
and we would literally do something.
1:01:47We have a learning plan on Solari now that came out of this.I would literally make them price
time and money for each course they took by course.And I would basically make them say, look,
what do you want to do in this life and what are the skills and tools you need to do it?
1:02:06And how are we going to go get those tools with the least amount of your time and the least
amount of your parents money?How are we gonna really?And we would come up with these wild
education plans where they would like, you know, go to San Francisco for this audio vidi course and
then they would be next year in Budapest studying at the university.
1:02:27You know, 'cause you wanna, you wanna you, you want kids to learn about the world and, and
you want them to be, you know, not provincial stuck And you want them to be educated.Yeah, you
want them to be educated?Anyway.But we would come up with these very creative things and what
you discover is net in a world of YouTube University and access to extraordinary, you know,
resources all around the world to get a great education.
1:02:54The the universities in the United States have gotten unbelievably bloated and unbelievably
off track.I I think everyone senses.That and they're they're a terrible and if.You're a, if you're a loving
parent, they're a terrible investment.You love your children, you want your children to be successful.
1:03:12If I want my child to be successful in the world we're going into, you know, whether it turns into
a control grid or the control grid, as I believe will fail.You know, you want them to have an
outstanding education.And I and I will tell you bluntly, the reason the unipolar model failed is
because we don't have a culture that can field and manage either.
1:03:34That's exactly right.We don't.We don't.Have we don't have human capital to run the world.We
don't have the human capital, but we're teaching.Our human capital to adopt a culture that that
cannot succeed exactly right right right so if you're gonna run the world you need.Eaton and
Sandhurst to to to provide an administrative class that's tough clear thinking has a, you know, well
defined mission.
1:03:56I don't start sacrificing.You need Christianity well.Well, both of those, you know.Certainly Eden
was a Christian School, right?You.You if.You, if you're going to be part of a project that is longer than
a lifetime, then you have to understand that this is about, you know, at the root, this is about your
immortal soul and your soul is immortal.
1:04:20And that that triggers a very different way of looking at the world and a very different way of
thinking.And then you have to be able to collaborate across time and space in very powerful
ways.That takes trust and faith.You have to be agreement capable and you can't run a a unipolar
model, let alone a successful multi polar model unless you're agreement capable.
1:04:43So this is Lavrov's term and this is what the Russians understood and This is why they
whooped our ass in Ukraine.They are agreement capable and we are not.Now, we're sure you've
heard plenty of those free phone.Promises from America's biggest wireless carriers.If those deals
sound too good to be true, it's probably because they are very often too good to be true.
1:05:01They come with layers of fine print, requiring you to sign up for four lines, plus activation fees,
plus plus plus this that.The other thing?You don't even understand what you're signing up for, and by
the time you're done, you've paid for that free phone 3X.It was a pretty expensive free phone.
1:05:18It's kind of a scam, honestly.Our wireless company is called Pure Talk and it's got a much
better and much more straightforward offer, and it comes with no strings whatsoever attached.With a
qualifying plan of just 35 bucks a month, you get legitimately the brand new Samsung Galaxy A26
for free.
1:05:35It's actually free.There aren't hidden costs.You're not signing up the rest of your life or
promising to name your kid after them or something.From virtually indestructible Gorilla Glass to
next generation camera lenses, the phone has basically everything that you want.All you need to do
is switch to Pure Talk. 35 bucks a month for unlimited talk, text and 15 gigs of data with mobile
hotspot all on America's most dependable 5G network.
1:05:59Go to puretalk.com/talker to claim your free Samsung Galaxy with qualifying plan when you
switch to Pure Talk Wireless by Americans for Americans, man, there's.There's absolutely so much
let.Me just move back once again to something that you said about policy makers, the Congress, the
central banks, the White House giving up on the American model in the mid 90s when the budget
deal failed, I think you said 90 it was 95.
1:06:29I vaguely remember that the you know, this, this democratic system or whatever version of a
democratic system we have, our system is incapable of self perpetuating long term.It's just too
dysfunctional.And that's obviously true.It's too corrupt, it's too corrupt, it's too corrupt.
1:06:46It's.Clearly true.Everyone senses that this isn't working.We're going to get a new system.They
figured that out 30 years ago.The one kind of brick wall that is looming right in the windshield is the
debt, is the debt meltdown.I mean, Ray Dalio talks about it every single day like we have too much
debt.
1:07:03People are going to stop buying our debt because it's clearly a bad deal.And like, what
happens then?And you suggested the control grid is in part designed to manage the population
during that moment maybe or to.Yeah, in part, yeah.So, so if you want to move people to a much
lower economic footprint, let alone do it on a shocking basis, having complete control is obviously
very con.
1:07:27OK.So the bottom line is everybody's about to get a lot.Poorer.Not everybody, but a lot.The
majority is about to get a lot poorer.Depends on how they do.That if you bring out breakthrough
energy, you can soften the blow.There are many things you can do to soften the blow.It doesn't have
to be like Russia in 90 and 91.
1:07:44It doesn't have to be.Can they do it that?Way, yes.So it comes down to who governs and and
do they want to do it?You know, one of my favorite lines is from Tina Turner.She says we can do this
nice or rough and we could do it nice and we can do it rough.
1:08:01There.There are ways of doing the control grid nice and we can do it rough.And what are they
planning?I don't know.To a certain extent.Remember the way in my experience, the way they govern
is they have targets and goals and then you know, you sort of make it up as you go and sometimes it
works and say it's very fluent.
1:08:20So I wonder if the AI if the data.Center boom, which really is the only sort of crackling,
sparkling piece of the real estate market right now.I think it's building data centers, development
market.Just call them control grids.Control grids.Control.I mean, look, I'm they're control.
1:08:35Nodes I'm totally opposed to.It but.Massive bets, economic bets on the success of AI,
right?And the missing piece is energy and how do you power all that?And we're already, as you
pointed out, an analysis.I you have to, you have to bring out the breakthrough energy, that's what.
1:08:50I'm saying so like either.They're going to build it on coal deposits in Wyoming or, which is
going to be kind of hard because they're going to have to say all that climate stuff we've been yelling
at you about for 30 years is total bullshit.Now we're burning coal.Well, there was just an article in
Bloomberg that Texas.
1:09:07Needs 30 new nuclear plants and the Chinese are building enormous numbers of nuclear
plants yeah, and there are risks in nuclear I mean every I'm.A right winger and I've always defended
nuclear, but let's be totally honest like it's not risk free big time well here's the thing how how do
you.How do you govern and manage nuclear plants with leadership that's not agreement capable
completely and and also like.
1:09:28In a country that's not turning out enough people in the hard, not enough engineers, right?So
no, there are huge problems with that.And but that's like that question is being forced on policy
makers like what do you do about energy?What do you do about energy?What do you mean wind
and solar?
1:09:44Like we're going to be laughing about that in five years because it's just silly.Well, one of the
things you can do about energy is.Depopulate, right?Right.And I know for a fact, I'm not guessing at
this, that there are people running countries around the world who've thought about like, what does
AI mean for my population?
1:10:01Means I've got too many people.So this is something I know this for a fact.I'm not guessing
that leaders of countries are talking about between each other.Like I know that.And I'm not saying
they're committing genocide or whatever, but they know they're just looking at heart statistics.
1:10:17They are that's.Exactly right, So.There's another thing.That I don't understand very well.I've
just listened to people.But if you listen to Sean Parker saying I'm going to live to 145 where there's
an interview where the president's son-in-law says, you know, we're going to be the last generation
to die or the 1st generation live forever.
1:10:39So you clearly have a group of people biohacking who think they can engage in massive
longevity.It makes me want to start smoking again.I'm just being.Honest, I don't want to be.I just want
to move.I want to pivot away from that level of soul destroying hubris because that's what that is.
1:10:55I'm God.No, you're not and you're going to find out the hard way that you're not.So it does
make me want to right.But what I'm saying is if you.If you truly believe you can do that and you're not
going to allow the general population to do it for environmental reasons, then you would be for
depopulation.
1:11:11Of course, you know that's totally true, so.This is again in Farfield.Do you think there's
evidence?That people.Will be living to 145.I have no idea.I don't either.I don't really care.In other
words, there's a whole set of scenarios I don't care about.I'm interested in freedom and I believe that
the only way we can be free is through a culture that embraces the divine and builds true wealth,
enduring wealth and and living wealth, not just financial wealth.
1:11:41What is true wealth?True wealth?Well, you know, because I would say you're truly, truly
wealthy.I feel I am right.I don't.Have that much money, but.I feel that way well.It's an integration of
living.Equity with financial equity.And what I learned being a financial advisor is that everyone had
been taught to build financial equity and they couldn't integrate it with living equity.
1:12:06So you'd, you'd work with somebody who's, you know, worth millions of dollars who said they
couldn't afford organic food.I was like, are you crazy?You know, the, the number one thing that
causes a diminution of family wealth is health problems and, and you know, healthcare fraud and
healthcare bankruptcy.
1:12:25It's like, you know, please take $1,000,000 out of your bank account and start investing in
really building, you know, doing everything you and your family need to be really healthy, you know,
to have perfect water, to have great food, et cetera.
1:12:40The other thing I discovered was, you know, everybody was trying to put their money in the
national security state instead of helping their kids buy homes and and integrating with, you know,
building the living equity.So my mother's family were Quakers and you didn't even think about buying
stock until you sent all your kids to the best Quaker schools.
1:13:00You know, that was like, that was first.Do you think it's you're dropping so?Much here I'm just
trying to pause, like tease out certain themes.But you think it's wiser, you know, if you have children
and you care about them to help them buy homes than it is to absolutely who.
1:13:17Who's so?Can I?There are two stories I'm dying to tell you, please.OK during the.Litigation,
you know.You get in the situation what litigation, So I litigated with the.Department of Justice.For
eleven years or actually it it was it was some of that was fisticuffing with the tax guys.
1:13:37But anyway, so so I had the sort of enemy of the state process of I had 18 audits,
investigations, 12 tracks of litigation, A smear campaign and physical harassment.So they didn't like
what you were saying?They didn't like the idea that I would try and stop.
1:13:54The mortgage bubble, they really wanted to have a mortgage bubble and and we were doing
things to bring disclosure to, to play.It's called place based financials.I really believed that if local
communities could see how all the money worked in their neighborhood that we could change
things.
1:14:14So for example, I would constantly when I was at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, I would find neighborhoods where we were spending 250,000 per unit to build public
housing and $50,000 would buy and rehab a defaulted A foreclosed property in the FHA inventory.
1:14:35And so literally, if you could just within a four or 10 block area, you know, take that 250,000
and, and, and spend it in the way that was the most efficient in that place, you could get four or five
homes for the price of 1.And it was really amazing when I took those numbers.
1:14:52We did all sorts of due diligence.This is when I was a contractor to the woman who worked for
the guy who ran the $250,000 program.And I showed it to her and I said, look, we could, you know,
New Orleans, Chicago, LA, we could get four or five homes for the price of 1.
1:15:10And she turned bright red.And she said, but how would we generate fees for our friends,
exactly right.Or how would we?You know, pay off foreign countries who flutter our political system
with donations If you know if we're actually spending it to like build nice houses for Americans.Well,
but like repair Reading PA, we could be spending it in wherever disgusting Middle Eastern place.
1:15:30So so if you look at place based.Financial statements, there's extraordinary opportunity to just
re engineer what's already there.Yeah, of course, without taking money from anybody else and and
making it.So I really thought if you if you create.So we created a software tool called Community
Wizard that would allow everybody on the Internet to just come and download the data and start
looking and how the money worked in their places in way that you could see real opportunities.
1:15:55OK so let me tell you 2 stories.The, the, the litigation starts and literally, you go from being
very wealthy and very trusted and very prospected to being an enemy of the state.No one will talk to
you to your phone, and suddenly all your income stops, all your income stops, your credit stops.
1:16:16You're just frozen.And by yours, you mean yours.Yeah.Yeah, so so.Anyway, so you know, you
you have the assets that you have.Luckily they never turned off my bank account.So I was lucky that
way.But one of the things that happened was they started, I'd had a farm in New Hampshire and I
sold my share to my uncle and a wonderful and very wealthy uncle who was like the patriarch and
and he bought my and I warned him, if you buy this, you know, they may come after you too.
1:16:49And he was a very stand up guy, very fearless.And he said, you know, I'll deal with that.So
sure enough, I sell him the farmland.They call him and they say, you know, your niece is a criminal
and you shouldn't be doing this, blah, blah, blah, blah.And and they said we want the financial
records from the farm.
1:17:08We want all the financial records of the farm.And he said, well, send me a letter so I can give
it to my lawyer and I'm happy to send them to you.So they, you know, and this is the summer farm
where all the family goes anyway.So.So instead of sending him a letter, they show up at his house in
Portsmouth, NH at 9:00 PM at night, 3 FBI guys and AIG guy with a subpoena.
1:17:34And it was designed to scare him.So the family had a big powwow should they drop me
because they don't want to be targeted?And, and he said, well, you know, she always helped us.So
it turned out I counted it up At that point I had lent or given to family and friends $250,000 just I made
a lot of money.
1:18:01I loved making money and people needed help and that's what's money's for.So that is what
to restate.That is what money.Is for so I just always don't.I hadn't even.Thought about it by the way,
your average like 23 year.Old NBA player who's floating all of his cousins and single mom.
1:18:16He understands that better than your average rich person.Your obligation is to your family and
including with money.Sorry, right?Some of us are lucky, some not.Amen.Right, so, so he said she
helped everyone, so I'm going to help her and it took eleven years, but at the very no, it was 2006.
1:18:37So that was about 9 years at at the end of the process when I won the litigation, I got AI, we
got money coming in.I sat down to either repay everybody who loaned me or gifted me money and
almost everybody.
1:18:54So I'm a just gifted and I, I counted it up and what I realized is I had come into the litigation
having loaned 1/4 of a million and then over the next nine years, exactly 1/4 of a million had come
back.
1:19:11And it, it wasn't tit for tat.I mean, it was different people, different thing.You know, some had
got and said, well, I guess she needs it back and repaid it.Or some had just gifted it because they
knew I'd gifted.And literally I put a quarter of a million out and a quarter of a million came back.
1:19:26And Tucker, if it wasn't for that money, I wouldn't be here.I would never have made it
through.And it was because it was the in the people back and they couldn't shut the people back
off.You know, they could.They could do all sorts of things to shut off all, all sorts of resources and
income.
1:19:42But if it's in the people back and the people you love and trust, you know, it comes back.So
when I love that, yeah, it's great.So when I finished.When I when I finished the litigation, I'd had a
four O 1K that I'd had to bust.It had 500,000 in it.
1:19:59I paid 225,000 in fines and taxes to get it out.Well the I don't think they thought they put my
4O1K under audit so I couldn't use it to finance the business.It was dirty tricks anyway.So so I take
the money out.
1:20:14So my accountant when we get the settlement money, she said let's fund up the four O 1 Ki
said no, I'm never going into business with the US government again.No way.I I don't, I don't want
any of those vehicles.I'm, I'm out.And I said, but the other thing is I'm taking that 500,000 and I'm
bonusing it out on the People Bank and I'm going to start a new business and I think that business
will be successful.
1:20:38So I don't need that 500,000.It'd be nice, but I don't need it.But I need to get that money back
on the People Bank because that is the only bank in this world I trust.And so that's like a
beautiful.Story.Well, here's the question.And I used to always say this with my clients, who's going to
be there for you, right?
1:20:59Who's going to be there for you?That that's the people bank and you want to invest in the
people bank.Now, it may not be money, it may be time, it may be help, it may be there's a, a
wonderful book called Family Wealth by a guy named James Hughes.I don't know if you've ever
heard of it or seen it.
1:21:15And basically what he does.My great uncle didn't like the book so much.He said, you're trying
to turn our family into a corporation.I said, no, I'm not, but it basically teaches a family how to
conspire together.It basically have a dinner once a month or once or whatever and talk about what's
in your heart to do.
1:21:33You know, this person wants to do this.This person wants to do this.Some things make
money, some things don't but but but help each other be successful at whatever your passion is and
and work as a family.You know, I always it's Solari.We say don't worry about if there is a conspiracy.
1:21:51If you're not in one, you need to start one.And a great family should be a a conspiracy where
you're trying to help each other succeed.I love that.Yeah.I mean, these are ancient and with respect
very obvious points exactly, but I I don't think I've heard someone say I'm in a long time.
1:22:10Well, but if we're going to build a successful.Culture.That culture has to be good at building
wealth, living wealth and financial wealth, both on an integrated basis.So if you come to Solari, we
have a curriculum called building Wealth and it has 6 pillars and we organize all of our content into
and around building wealth.
1:22:33And because it's, it's part of what you have to build to build a culture that can really be part of
real solutions.So the the first pillar is free and inspired life.And so, you know, our theory is you have
a goal, you have a relationship with the creator and you decide, you know, what's, what's your free
and inspired life?
1:22:53Everybody's unique and in a decentralized world, everybody is unique.You, you know, there's
no, there's no formula, so to speak.The second one is navigation tools.And that's where people get
burnt.
1:23:09So we say in navigation tools, there's an official reality and then there's reality and you need
to know both and reality is for the management of your time and money and the official realities for
the cocktail party.And you need to not get those.Don't use the official reality to manage your time and
money because then you're going to get, I mean, I clean so many people up from financial fraud and
health care fraud because they believe the official reality.
1:23:33So you, you can't do that.The third is risk management, because it in this kind of dangerous
environment, everything's about keeping your risk down.And that's more important than making
money.It's more important to lower risk than make money.So in a, in a, in a well governed world,
we'd all be, you know, focused on outside.
1:23:54But now we're just, we've got.To be focused on.Preventing loss.And then the 4th is living
equity.And that's all living things.That's people, that's family, that's culture, that's education, you
know, all the things that go into that.
1:24:10And then financial equity, all the things you know.And then the last one is, to me, the most
important.It's called Turtle Forth.So did you get the hat, the Turtle Forth hat?I did, yeah.OK.Turtle
Forth is about never quitting.You must never, ever quit.
1:24:27And the whole goal of the people who are trying to centralized is to get you to think it's
hopeless.And John Rapoport used to always say hopelessness is an op and it's planet wide.Well,
because I am.
1:24:44I am actually struck.By well, by everything that you've said, I think this could be like a nine
hour conversation if we let it.But I have one more story.But I am.Struck also by.Your tone, I don't
think I've ever heard someone describe dark deeds with more cheerfulness.
1:25:02Like, how do you, how do you not go crazy?So you have to keep a state of amusement.I
mean, it, it's I, I really, you know, I, one of the most breakthrough moments for me in the last 20
years was when I, I realized that it was OK to be happy no matter what was going on.
1:25:21And sometimes you can't be, it's so horrible what's going on.But it, I'll tell you exactly what
had happened.I had a wonderful church where I studied spiritual warfare for 2 1/2 years at the
beginning of the litigation.And it was that training that saved my life.And but I was at a sermon and
there was a Co pastor who had very long fingernails and she was very angry and she was shaking
her hands with her long fingernails.
1:25:47And you know, sometimes when you're in a big church and they point right at you, and she
said, she said, she said, the devil can have my house and the devil can have my car, but the devil
cannot have my joy.And it was like I exploded in my head and I said, that's it.
1:26:04That is it.That is it.Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.You may have noticed that the companies.Whose
products you buy tend to kind of hate you.They're controlled by massive multinational corporations
and they have all kinds of weird agendas that you're supporting when you buy their products.We
didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, were in this category.
1:26:23We just want a nicotine pouch.And then they lecture you and take the money you give them to
support things that you hate.So we decide we're going to make our own, and we did.And it is, we
can say, not bragging here, just stating fact, The single best nicotine pouch in the world.It's called out
and it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors, Wintergreen, tropical fruit, chilled mint, refreshing
chilled sweet nectar and a bunch of others that we're rolling out.
1:26:48By the way, there are 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors will not be named Zin and
they're in three, six and 9 milligrams.It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made.Go to
alppouch.com.Will not regret it.So it's a conscious decision not allow that.
1:27:08To allow that joy to be stolen from you, right?And it's sometimes it's hard Did.You ever, did you
ever see the never ending story, the movie, the never ending story?Read the book.So, so it's a
wonderful child's story where the child is the protagonist and he's fighting a force in the universe
called the Nothing.
1:27:28And the Nothing is running around the universe sucking meaning out of everything.And it's
hard when you're dealing.And if you look at this digital control, it comes with an energy that's very
demonic and, and sucking meaning out of everything.And they're very good.
1:27:43They're masterful at turning, you know, turning allies against each other.The divine and
conquer thing is really heartbreaking.It's happening right now on the right heartbreak.And.So you're
up against the nothing.And so sometimes we'll come together in a team meeting and somebody will
say I've lost my state of amusement.
1:28:04And then the team's job is to help them to get.I've lost my state of amusement.I've lost.My
state of amusement.And it happens.I can't, you know, but it is I think of this of myself where?You
know, I've had my amusement taken from me a number of times, but I always think to myself, like, if
you're perennially shocked by evil in the world, like you're a child, you're an idiot.
1:28:27Like, what did you think this was like?Don't be naive.There's a lot of evil in the world.There
always has been.Don't be shocked by it.Laugh in its face.You're always going to be shocked by
it.Oh, I.Am you're always going to be shocked by it and.I'll tell you why you're.Going to be shocked
by it.If you understand, If you understand love, you can't fathom why anyone would would reject that
and embrace.
1:28:58Evil because.It's so stupid.It's so wasteful.It's so, as my mother used to say, it's so
unnecessary.You know, it's just like it's, you just can't fathom why anybody would do it.
1:29:15I, I, you know, I, I, I watch the folks who are in the financial system who are deeply corrupt and
just constantly take and take and take, you know, the, the plunder team.And I think, how is that?
1:29:32To me, what they're doing is not fun.I love, it's not fun.It's not fun when, when so I will tell you I
would my gift, everybody has a gift.My gift was an investment bank.I was absolutely fantastic.I was
just really, really good at it.
1:29:47And the heartbreak for me was when I got had to leave the establishment, I lost the ability,
you know, it's like a painter and you lose your ability to paint.You can't get access to colors
anymore.So.But I loved it.And when you do it in the right way, 2 + 2 = 20.
1:30:05And it's so exciting.It's the best feeling in the world.It's like a oh, I've lived it.Yeah.So when
Van.Co it's my theory.When Van Co finished a painting that that's what he wow, it's like, wow, you
know, it's great.And and you watch these guys do the fraud and destroy, you know, all the mortgage
fraud and it destroys neighborhoods and it destroys family and it's just it's just it's like a lose, lose,
lose.
1:30:31And you think that's no fun.No, and and they're not happy.I, I know a number of them and I
had a conversation with Ray Dalio, who I do like.I don't agree with him and everything, but I, I do like
Ray Dalio and he's got more perspective on life.
1:30:47He had lost a child.I think he was forced to kind of think through what matters.And I asked him
off camera recently, like, do you know what?I know a lot of miserable billionaires.I know a couple of
happy billionaires, but how many happy billionaires do you know?He's like, I know a few.Like I'm, I'm
actually pretty happy, but not that many.
1:31:04And that that's a tell, right?That's a tell and I I will tell you the.Debt is a symptom.It's not the
problem.The what's a symptom?The debt.Yeah, the debt, the.Debt is a simple.Yeah, it.When there
was 21 trillion missing as of 2015 when we published that study in 2017, there's 21 trillion of debt.
1:31:27Now first of all, remember the Treasury can just issue currency.They don't need debt to create
the currency.And in fact, I would say historically the greatest currencies or Fiat currencies that are
not debt based.So our problem is the debt basing.But, but let's just grossly oversimplify and talk
about what that means with the 21 trillion.
1:31:49So the Treasury sells pension, sells Treasury bonds to our pension funds, moves 21 trillion
into the bank accounts at the New York Fed member banks for the Treasury.They're the
depository.And then the 21 trillion disappears out of the back door.
1:32:07So it's just a straw that's sucking our pension fund money into, I call it the breakaway
civilization.And meantime, we as taxpayers are now obligated to pay the debt into that we owe our
pension funds and the money is gone.
1:32:25Why do you call it the breakaway civilization?Breakaway civilization was a term
made.Famous by Richard Dolan and it simply described a decision to create a parallel system.You
know, first it started with the black budget, but it grew, you know, call it the national security state, but
but to build a civilization that literally was separate and not subject to the laws of the existing 1.
1:32:51So if I'm running a company and I want to bring up new systems, I'll bring up the new systems
while I'm running the old and I'll run them in parallel and I'll move things over slowly.And then at
some point I bring the current thing down.And to me, that's what the financial coup was.
1:33:06You're moving the money out of one system and and putting it in another.So in theory, 21
trillion is enough at a 5%, you know, interest rate to basically finance a a private government if you
will, right.
1:33:23I'm not saying that's what happened, but in theory do you think it did?So when I was at
HUD.In 1989 it was 80, late 89 or early 90.I was in a meeting with the Secretary and we had brought
all the regional administrators in for a meeting with the Secretary.
1:33:45And he was very upset because the regional administrator from California had implemented
something in response to a court decision.There was a court case in the Court of Appeals and they
decided, OK, you got to go to the right.And so he had implemented that.
1:34:01And the secretary was having literally like a manic episode, screaming a huge temper
tantrum, screaming at him.And finally this guy said, but Mr. Secretary, it's the law.And he just
exploded with fury and he said the law, the law.
1:34:21I don't have to obey the law.I report to a higher moral authority.And just at that moment, it was
like, remember the scene and eyes wide shout when you first walk in on the, you know, the secret
society doing their occult ritual.
1:34:37You know, you had this image of, oh, you know, he literally, he, he doesn't have to obey the
laws of the United States.He's operating under a different governance structure.People feel that way,
right?And that.You know, there, there.Are many.
1:34:54There's a very famous story of Lincoln when he's talking about his, what he wants to do to
implement the Reconstruction policies.And he tells the story about a young child saying, you know, if
I throw the fish back, dad'll get mad at me.
1:35:12But if I, if I, if it slips for my hand accidentally and you grab it, then Dad won't be mad at
me.And the implication of the story is that Lincoln has a dad that he he can't buck.
1:35:30And and, you know, we're back to the question, who's dad?It's the same question as who's
Mr. Global.And you've never gotten closer to the answer.Or you've never settled on an answer.I
here's my guess.So we did.
1:35:45I once did a 2 hour interview on the Solari report on who is Mr. Global, where we go through
all the different theories.So I think literally you have intergenerational pools of capital which meet and
work by consensus.You know, it's a committee system and they do have a set of rules.
1:36:03And what I don't understand, I think their challenge is they're risk managers and they're
they're constantly pulling out a lot of money and they always need to get that dividend.And the
question is, why do they need the dividend?Where's the money going?
1:36:19Because they're constantly running the financial system to extract extra money.There's always
disappearing money.And the question is why and where's it's going?And you think it's going to
infrastructure projects?I think it's going to infrastructure projects.
1:36:34I think it's going to big investments like, you know, building the control grid is a big one.And
one of my questions on the financial coup is are they literally setting up an endowment so they can
run, you know, the world on a global governance that's a dictatorship with an endowment.
1:36:53So it's the, you know, it's it's a bigger endowment than anybody else's.You said a.Couple
minutes ago that the debt the our the US government's debt, which I think even people are not
interested in the stuff are aware that it's it's it's there and that it's a problem is not the problem it's a
symptom.
1:37:13What did what did you mean we if you look at our.Current model, it is not being run on an
economic basis and it's getting much worse and it's getting worse steadily.So let me give you an
example.Our military budget this year is approximately 850 billion, and the President wants to take it
or the Secretary of Defense is saying we've got to take it to a trillion.
1:37:40Our HHS budget is 1.8 trillion.Doctor Skidmore just did an analysis.If we went back to 2010
levels of disability, we would lower that by half a trillion dollars, half a trillion, half a trillion.
1:37:57So.America is, I call it the great poisoning.We've poisoned ourselves and it's blowing the
budget.And it's not just blowing the budget of the federal government.If you look at family budgets,
it's blowing their budgets.You know, poison people are not productive and and their health care costs
can be very expensive.
1:38:15And you see that at the federal level and you see that at the state level, the local level and the
family level.That's got to be dealt with.But you know, if if you look at the budget right now, it's
expenses are skyrocketing and and it's skyrocketing because the fundamental model of what we do
and how we do it, it helps to centralized, but it's not economic.
1:38:38And so you got to change that.Now what we do and how we do it.Do you mean how we?Live
right, So now I get to tell.You my last story.OK, I can't wait.OK, This is called the Red Button story,
and if you put my name in on the Internet, you'll get, you know, a copy of the story because it
happened to me.
1:39:00In 2000, I was asked by a healthcare practitioner to give a presentation called How the Money
Works on Organized Crime, and it later became a very famous article called Narco Dollars for
Beginners.And it was meant to be a light, funny description of the intersection of organized crime
flows with Washington and Wall Street.
1:39:24So my book, I have an online book called Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Profits that
is a case study that teaches people it's designed to be like a business school's case study that
shows you that intersection between illegal cash flows and Wall Street and Washington.
1:39:42Anyway, so I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm describing the congressional testimony on
the Dark Alliance allegations that happened in 1998.And at the time I was helping a reporter do
research and she was covering the hearings and a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told
her.
1:40:04So I'm in the middle of the speech and there are about 100 people and we're the conference
that where I'm speaking.Is a conference that happens once a year by this group and the focus is on
how we evolve our society spiritually so this is a very spiritually committed group of people who want
to evolve our society spiritually.
1:40:24OK, so I'm describing the the fact that a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told this
reporter, I was helping that the US economy launders 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of all
illegal money.So that's narcotics trafficking, that's financial fraud.
1:40:41That's, you know, everything.It's human trafficking.And, and the number is now much, much
bigger.But they were describing the fact that the US economy and financial system is the leader
globally in laundering dirty money.So I said to this wonderful group of spiritually evolved people, what
would happen if we stopped being the global leader in money laundering?
1:41:07And we had a little conversation.They said, well, you know, the money would leave the New
York Stock Exchange and go to Singapore or Zurich or London and, and we'd have, we might have
trouble financing the government deficit because we, you know, now we borrow over half of the
money currently.
1:41:25And, and so we, we, you know, our taxes might go up or our government checks might
stop.So I said, OK, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern.And if you push that
button, you can stop all hard, hard narcotics trafficking in your town, your county, your state
tomorrow, thus offending the people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year Volt dirty money
in the accumulated capital they're on.
1:41:52Who here will push the button?And out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society
spiritually, guess how many would push the button?I don't know one the.Other 99.Would not push
the button, so I wouldn't keep all those kids from dying, Yeah.It would so wait.
1:42:08So, so I said to them, I said, why would you not push the button?So we had a little
conversation.They said we don't want our taxes to go up, we don't want our government checks to
stop and we don't want our four O 1 KS and Iras to go down.So if I had voted, there would have
been two pushing the red button.
1:42:27So what I discovered that day, the problem was that not that they wouldn't push the red
button, but they wouldn't go into the invention room and have a an honest conversation about what
the real problem was.And how I call it, how we turn the red button green, how we make money
pushing the red button.
1:42:45Because then we can push the red button.And you have to push the red button because you
cannot become wealthy liquidating your children.You cannot become wealthy by poisoning your
children and your people.And yet that's what we've been doing in America for decades now.
1:43:03And now here's the political problem.If you're the new president of the United States and you
walk into the Oval Office, your political guy is going to say to you, Mr. President, the American
people just spent billions getting you voted in as president.
1:43:20And now they want payback.They want their government contract.They want their
privatization, they want the COLA increase on Social Security, they want a community block
development grant.And you're going to turn to your secretary of charging.He says, well, you better
be nice to the people who could drove 500 billion to a trillion dollars and the accumulated capital
they're on.
1:43:38And of course the number's much bigger now.Now how are you going to press the red
button?You can't.And if you look at the history of politics in America, the history is everybody wants
their check and they want the story of I am good, I'm a good Christian.
1:43:53I'm not doing any of this corrupt organized crime stuff.You know, I'm just voting, you know, So,
so I say it this way.When Goldwater, the end of World War 2, George Keenan said we got 6% of the
people and 50% of the resources and we're going to have to be tough if we keep this going.
1:44:12So Goldwater ran for president.He said we're going to have to drop a lot of bombs.And the
American people said, oh, no, we don't want to do that.We're good Christians.So Jimmy Carter came
along and he shivered in front of the fireplace, and Americans said, oh, no, we don't want to do that.
1:44:27We don't want to cut back.And so the Bushes came along and said, you know something?You
all are good Christians.Here's your check.Don't ask questions.And that's where we've
been.Everybody wants the story of I Am good.And the problem you can, you can push the red
button, you can turn it green, but it has to be done one neighborhood at a time.
1:44:48You need to take all the money into place and instead of spending the government money to
centralized control and on the control grid, you need to re engineer it to build real wealth.And, and
you've got to decentralize the economic power.If you centralized and you create lots of billionaires,
you're going to shrink the pie.
1:45:07And that's what we've been doing.And we've been making money from poisoning each other.If
people want to learn more about your.Research and your views on things.If they want to know about
the 11 years you spent fighting the feds for blowing the whistle on them, where do they?
1:45:26Where do they get that information?So we published the Solari report.It's solari.com SOLAR,
i.com and we have a subscription service and we have a lot of free, you know, so if you want to get
to know us, you can come in and you can learn tremendous amounts from the free stuff.
1:45:42We'd love to have you as a subscriber and we have a great group of subscribers.We have,
what happened to me was I, I fell into this because I had terrible, terrible experiences with the
corporate media.And, and so I just started doing shows and giving out my e-mail and saying, if you
have a question, ask me.
1:46:04And over many years, the questions would come in and we'd publish the answers and, you
know, it would go on and on and went on for free for a long time.And then finally, I got so many
questions that I would just, you know, I finally said I need to hire people.But we have this global
network of subscribers and audience who get on the site, share comments, They're brilliant.
1:46:25And we help each other figure figure things out.And we've literally become an intelligence
network, you know, and it's all people who want to be free.And they all understand one can't be free
unless we're all free.You know, this is an all or nothing thing.They either get the control grid or we're
free.
1:46:43And the only way we're going to be free is if everybody's free.It's an all or nothing deal.And
there are a lot of people now who understand this and are gathering and, you know, so I have many
subscribers.I don't.I just know from what they say.I have many subscribers.Who are your
subscribers?
1:46:59Because they feel and I feel you're on the same journey.Yeah.I'm just not a very systematic
thinker.So a lot of my instincts tell me that you're telling the truth.And of course, I agree completely
with your orientation.I just, my brain doesn't work that way.So it's been a a true pleasure to hear all of
this.
1:47:17Thank you.Well, thank you, I.I love your work, so thank you.I've been a I've been a subscriber
from the very beginning.Underground bases, you're following my.Mind Catherine Austin Fitts, thank
you very much.
