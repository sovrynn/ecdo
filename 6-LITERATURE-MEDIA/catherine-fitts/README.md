Carlson (1:12): So, thank you for doing this. I know you worked on it for years, but if you're just an aware person, you get the sense that there is a concerted attempt by governments around the world to digitize commerce and currency, essentially to control people through money, correct?

Fitts (1:34): That's correct. OK, so that was my first question. Is this happening? Am I imagining it? It's absolutely happening, and what's important to understand is that it's been happening for a long time. In other words, this is like an invisible corral that they've been building around you for a long, long time because, you know, how does a few sneak up on the many?

Carlson (1:54): Well, you have to do it very quietly and invisibly before you throw the trap. So, essentially, what they're building is converting a currency system into a control system. It's really the end of currency. What they're doing is building various digital components, and when they integrate and come together, you literally have a digital concentration camp.

Fitts (2:19): It's complete and utter control. Otherwise known as the world. Here's the thing to understand. We, you and I, grew up in a world where there was mass media, where you were pitching stories. You know, so you had 57 varieties of ice cream, and you're pitching them to 57 different niches, but you're still pitching to mass audiences.

Carlson (2:39): What we're talking about is a system where you can surveil, control, and influence one person at a time. With AI and software, each person can have their customized surveillance, influence, nudging, control, and punishment system.

Fitts (2:57): Yes, enforcement. Because ultimately, if you control money, you can starve people to death. You can kill them. Right. So, go back and think of the pandemic. If I say you can't go more than a mile from your home, and I say you have to be mandated to take a pharmaceutical, then if you don't take the pharmaceutical, I can turn off your money.

Carlson (3:20): If you go more than a mile away from your home, your money and your credit cards won't work. So, if you know, whatever rules I lay down, there's a wonderful, wonderful example. The head of the Bank of International Settlements is the central bank of central banks, and it has been running the process to implement a basically all-digital monetary system.

Fitts (3:44): And they have innovation hubs all over the world. They've been running this process for a long time. In 2020, when the pandemic started—or, more accurately, by October 2020, when the pandemic was underway—the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements was on an IMF panel.

Carlson (4:01): And in one minute, it's the first time in my life I have ever seen a central banker tell the truth. I fell off my chair. And he said, you know, the beauty of this is that we can set the rules on how your money works, and we have the technology to enforce them.

Fitts (4:19): And what he was saying is literally that from any place in the world where the technology exists, you can track each person individually. You can set a complex list of rules, like legislation, regulation, and administrative policy.

Carlson (4:38): And you can enforce them all with technology, with AI and software. Have you ever seen the wonderful movie called *The Lives of Others* about the German Stasi and surveillance? It's about a group of artists and creative, talented people who are under surveillance by the German Stasi, and it shows what it's like to be under surveillance 24/7.

Fitts (5:02): Think of each one of us. We're all under surveillance, not just by governments but also by corporations that are trying to do something. And it may not be anything nefarious. So, 80 different companies are trying to sell you something, or 80 different companies are trying to get your data for some reason.

Carlson (5:20): And so, they have AI and software bots that track you, follow you, learn from you, and try to influence what you do because they're attempting to extract some kind of value from you. Literally, think of being attacked by a swarm of bees.

Fitts (5:36): We're surrounded now by a swarm of AI software bots, all trying to learn from us, extract something from us, or get us to do something. Now, when you go to an all-digital system, there's no escape.

Carlson (5:52): And then they can start literally enforcing rules. They do so now. So, what are the manifestations of this that maybe we're not paying attention to or don't perceive for what they are? Look at what they did to the Canadian truckers. We don't like what you're doing.

Fitts (6:07): We cut off your money and your friends' money. And if people help you, we cut off their money too. So, I've known many different people around the country who've been debanked. We just passed legislation in Tennessee stating that banks over a certain size cannot debank someone for political or religious reasons.

Carlson (6:25): You know, and you're, you're one of the things that's happened. There's no such federal law. Not that I know of, but I haven't. I've been working with the states because, ultimately, the one power currently under the Constitution in the United States that can stop this is: the powers not delegated to the federal government by the states are reserved to the states.

Fitts (6:48): In other words, the states are technically more powerful than the federal government, and under the Constitution, they have the power to override the federal government on many different issues, including healthcare. And so, one of the tensions we see in America is that there is an increasing debate between the feds and the states about who has what power.

Carlson (7:11): So we've seen a lot of the conservative AGs and treasurers pushing back in a wonderful and marvelous way. The challenge they face is this: and this was said to me by a senator in northern Ohio.

Fitts (7:26): Northern Ohio has one of the best groups of freedom-fighting legislators in the country. And as you probably know—because you know Montana—it's very beautiful, and you're talking about Montana and Idaho. So, it's right next to Montana.

Carlson (7:42): So, one of the Idaho senators said to me, "My problem is, every time I fight to implement the Constitution, I learn that every year we send a dollar to Washington, and every year Washington sends back $1.19."

Fitts (7:58): And when I say I want to implement the Constitution, my constituents tell me, "I'd rather have the $0.19." So what we've been watching, literally since World War II, is the federal government—and a very large one—both in monetary and fiscal policy—buying people out of the Constitution and buying the whole federal system.

Carlson (8:20): I mean, the federal government is right now operating so far outside the law. It's, you know, unbelievable. That's the challenge before us. If we want to be free, we're going to have to decide. We're not going to let ourselves be controlled.

Fitts (8:37): You know, it's like being walked into the slaughterhouse. We're not going to walk into the slaughterhouse. But you don't even—I guess what bothers me about it is that there's something wonderfully straightforward, horrifying, but wonderfully straightforward about just a conventional invasion where people show up with guns and tell you what to do, because at least you know who the enemy is.

Carlson (8:55): But there's something very scary in an insidious way about being lulled into slavery. Right. And the thing to understand about the lulling is that it is the lulling. The marketing plan works one person at a time. In other words, you know, you buy with money; your friend buys by knocking them off or through other means; and your other friend, I— I get a control file on them.

Fitts (9:20): So, there are thousands of different ways of nudging—using carrots and sticks to get everybody into control and into the trap. And what is so insidious about this is that much of the marketing plan is invisible, and it’s really crafted one by one.

Carlson (9:40): The odds seem overwhelming against the average person in a system you just described. So, how far are we from not being able to exercise constitutional freedoms? I don't know how many years it will take. They're clearly pushing to have this done by 2030.

Fitts (9:59): And you know, what I do have to say is that if you look at what it takes to stop it, I believe they're going to fail. Now, what I don't underestimate is how much damage they could do. And the, you know, the failure may not come in time to save America.

Carlson (10:16): If we could just stop and define terms: who's they? The central bankers, yes, right. So, we have a Democratic Republic, or we have a Republic and use this democratic process. What happened in 1913 is that the bankers took control of monetary policy.

Fitts (10:34): What they're trying to do now is take control of fiscal policy. Once they get control of fiscal policy, it's going to be much harder to reverse it. Can you? I'm going to ask a series of really dumb questions. I hope you'll indulge me. What's the difference? Taxation without representation.

Carlson (10:50): But between fiscal and monetary policies. OK. Monetary policy is my control of the process by which currency is issued, including through such mechanisms. So, I generally govern and control credit issuance, and from that, the creation and management of the currency.

Fitts (11:10): Fiscal policy is when I control the taxes and the borrowing of the U.S. government. Now, because the central bank basically operates the borrowing, you know, it's the borrowing shared. But this comes down to, you know, this is the Boston Tea Party moment.

Carlson (11:27): Can they tax without representation? So I'll give you a little story. During the Biden administration, Biden nominated someone for control of currency who was ultimately not approved. The Republicans in the Senate killed the nomination before she was officially nominated, three weeks before she wrote an article in the Vanderbilt Law Review that said the great thing about central bank digital currency—in other words, an all-digital currency system—is that it provides the perfect tool to deal with inflation.

Fitts (11:58): If inflation gets out of hand, you just freeze everybody's bank accounts. Nice. Right, right, right. You know, it's so. Inflation is a creation of monetary policy; it's a result of monetary policy.

Carlson (12:14): It's like something that somebody did to you. Well, there are two things that cause inflation. One is monetary policy—managing monetary policy in a way that creates monetary inflation. But you also have, and we're going through it now, what I call deglobalization, where you have real increases in the cost of goods.

Fitts (12:37): So, my cost of goods is going up. And it's not because they're issuing, you know, too much currency relative to growth. It's because we are reversing globalization. Globalization created a whole lot of lower costs for a variety of reasons.

Carlson (12:52): So, if you had a severing of supply chains, for example, that would cause inflation because it simply costs more to get the materials into the goods. And, it's not just higher prices; it's that some products, many products, become uneconomical and disappear. So, when you hiccup supply chains—especially if you do it suddenly or dramatically, which is what we're observing now—it wreaks havoc.

Fitts (13:17): So, think of it like a flotilla of ships that need to turn. If the aircraft carrier doesn't let everybody know they're turning, then the boats aren't ready to turn. And you have boats smashing into each other. You sink a lot of ships.

Carlson (13:34): So, leaving aside whether that was wise or not, that's what we're doing. Right. So, you get inflation from that. Of course, you're absolutely right. If oil prices go up, you get inflation. Right. And that deglobalization started during the financial crisis. So, you know, it's been accelerating now, but it's not that we just started it.

Fitts (13:52): How did it start during 2008? Yes, yes. Why? Because, for several reasons, but one is that we were trying to exercise more and more control through the dollar system. We have always exercised a lot of power and control and extracted a subsidy from the dollar system.

Carlson (14:13): But more and more people are trying to get out of the system, and the financial crisis, starting with the Asian crisis in 1997, was a real wake-up call for Asia. You know, you need to create more resiliency. But more and more things are happening.

Fitts (14:29): And then, in 2008, it started to accelerate with the creation of the, you know, as the BRICS began to organize and work to pull out of the. The idea was that the world economy was based on the dollar. The people who issue and administer the dollar are not running things responsibly.

Carlson (14:45): Therefore, we need a separate safe haven. The people running the dollar system want a unipolar model. The US wants a unipolar model. And we don't want to be part of a unipolar model because, if you look at the level of subsidy they're extracting, we don't want that level of subsidy extracted.

Fitts (15:07): And if you look at some of the rules and regulations, we don't want to be a part of them. So, in India, I don't know if you've ever seen one of the greatest explanations of globalization ever given. Sir James Goldsmith came to the United States in 1994 and did an interview with Charlie Rose, during which he described why we should never approve the Uruguay Round of GATT and institute the WTO.

Carlson (15:32): And to this day, he nailed it perfectly. If you could summarize his argument, what would it be? He said, "We are going to hollow out the middle class in the West, and we are going to devastate our culture—our ultimate culture, yes, our culture."

Fitts (15:52): We're going to devastate our culture, and we're going to devastate the quality of the food supply. He said that. Yes, so now those are my words for saying it. You should watch it. And I think, to this day, it's the best description.

Carlson (16:08): And if you read my online book and listen to Sir James Goldsmith, they both describe the fact that we knew we knew what we were. In other words, the leadership knew that this would destroy or devastate the West. So why did they do it?

Fitts (16:26): That's the $64,000 question. I think they hate the West. Defenders of the West, I don't think. I think one of the reasons they did it is that they wanted to create the capacity and centralize the capital they needed to go into space.

Carlson (16:45): And I think they knew that every 100 or so years, central bankers do a reset. I think they knew they were coming into a reset, and they felt that with this technology, if they didn't globalize, someone else would. They wanted to control the process.

Fitts (17:05): They needed the money to go into space—the capital. Well, I don't even know what that means. So, I think they wanted to build the capacity to become a multi-planetary civilization. Really? Yeah. Spring and summer are here.

Carlson (17:22): That's good news. It means you get to go outside and frolic in the sunshine. Unfortunately, there's a downside. Burglars are psyched for the longer days. It means fewer people are home, and that gives them more chances to break in and steal your stuff. This is not our imagination.

Fitts (17:38): FBI crime data backs it up. More daylight means more burglaries. That's bad, but there is a solution. You can leave your house feeling secure with SimpliSafe. This is a really cool idea. Millions of Americans use it. It's the highest standard in home security.

Carlson (17:55): You get peace of mind every time you leave. A traditional burglar alarm system, maybe the one you already have, only goes off after someone has broken into your house. That's not good. Smashed a window? Come to the basement door? Whatever the case, SimpliSafe prevents intrusions before they happen and does so with AI-powered cameras and live professional agents.

Fitts (18:15): Monitoring it leaves nothing to chance. Plans for SimpliSafe start at around a dollar per day, so it's not crazy expensive at all. Visit simplisafethatssimplisafe.com/tucker and get 50% off a new system with professional monitoring.

Carlson (18:32): You get your first month for free at thatssimplisafe.com/tucker. There was no safe like SimpliSafe. Man, I was caught up in such minutiae in 1994. I never heard anybody say that. I had no idea that was happening. So I became—I didn't become convinced of that in 1994; I became convinced.

Fitts (18:49): Were you still working for the federal government in 1994? My company was the lead financial advisor for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and I was trying to clean up the mortgage corruption. What I ran smack into was that they were clearly and intentionally setting up the infrastructure to dramatically increase mortgage fraud.

Carlson (19:12): Intentionally, mortgage fraud is a public-private partnership between the New York Fed member banks and the federal government. So, the Treasury and the Fed were clearly engineering a massive new mortgage bubble. Essentially, I was doing a series of things, and that mortgage bubble was going to Centralized Capital. I was working on a whole plan coming out of the Bush administration.

Fitts (19:37): We were taking all our profits and investing in building a software infrastructure that would help communities decentralize political and economic power, but in a way that would create new wealth. One of the projects we had was working with a subsidiary that was collaborating with the top pension fund leaders in the country.

Carlson (20:02): Our job was essentially to figure out how the pension funds could invest so they could handle the baby boomer demographic going through the pension and retirement system. We also needed to determine how they could invest their money, given their size, to benefit America.

Fitts (20:24): You know, how do you build a stronger America in a way that helps the baby boomers live in retirement? And I made a presentation in the spring of 1997 at a big money management firm outside of Pennsylvania.

Carlson (20:42): And one of the board members was a money manager who worked with a lot of pension funds. So, we had all these top corporate and state pension fund leaders. I made a presentation; we had conducted a simulation of reengineering the Philadelphia economy to achieve this.

Fitts (20:58): And the top pension fund leader looked at me and said, "Oh my God, you know, this is very similar to what we tried long ago, and it didn't work." I responded, "You didn't have the Internet; you didn't have the tools to increase the average person's learning metabolism enough, on an economic basis, to achieve that."

Carlson (21:17): We had built a data servicing company in low-income communities, and we were able to demonstrate how easily we could help people on welfare off welfare, making lots of money and being very productive at high speed. He looked at me and said, "You don't understand, it's too late."

Fitts (21:35): I said, "What do you mean it's too late?" He said, "They've given up on the country. They're moving all the money out starting in the fall." He said, "You've got to get to Nick Brady." Nick had been my partner; I had been a partner at Dylan Reed, and Nick had been the chairman of Dylan Reed before he became Secretary of the Treasury. At that point, Nick is out, but he's still somewhat involved.

Carlson (21:55): Anyway, he said, "You've got to get to Nick and let him know it's not hopeless. This can all be turned around." I thought he meant we—the pension funds—have been instructed to reinvest equity and reallocate our equity into emerging markets, which made sense because they have a much higher growth rate.

Fitts (22:14): What I didn't realize then, and I realized shortly thereafter, in October of 1997 (the beginning of the 1998 fiscal year), was that huge amounts of money started disappearing from the US government.

Carlson (22:31): And literally, by the time of 9/11, there was $4.1 trillion missing from DoD and HUD. And if you remember, the day before 9/11, Donald Rumsfeld stood up and, basically, held a press conference, stating that there were $2.3 trillion in undocumented adjustments last year at DoD, and we're missing money.

Fitts (22:54): And it's, you know, worse than terrorism. Then, of course, I was working on a report about a huge story that would be published that Friday after 9/11 regarding the missing money. We had been working on it for over a year. She had done nine stories, and I had helped her with nine stories because we were trying to get the General Accounting Office.

Carlson (23:13): Now they call it the General Accountability Office. But we were trying to get both Congress and the GAO to do something about it and to try to stop it. And anyway, as you know, priorities changed, right?

Fitts (23:30): And for reasons that we still don't understand. Oh, I understand. Yeah. Well, I don't think the average person— the average person— I think sort of thinks, well, maybe there were 19 guys from Saudi Arabia or something. I call the Patriot Act the Control and Concentration of Cash Flow Act because, after 9/11, one of the things that happened was...

Carlson (23:51): If you look at the history of the black budget—the secret financing that the government uses for classified projects—that pot of money had grown and grown and grown, and it had become very dysfunctional to access. Mortgage fraud, I believe, was one of the biggest sources.

Fitts (24:10): And that's why what I was doing sort of went to the heart of the problem. However, the Patriot Act and that whole process were very successful at moving a lot more money onto the budget.

Carlson (24:26): In other words, it made it much easier to obtain enormous amounts of money for the national security state as a result of what happened. Now, you know, whenever you do an operation like this, you stack functions. So it's only one of many goals, but it was very successful.

Fitts (24:42): We all went right over my head. I thought it was all about Muhammad Atta. I had no idea. I know you're laughing. I want to tell you my church story. Wait, hold on. There's so many threats here. Yeah, there's a lot of threats. I just want to, I don't want to let it continue to hang in the air regarding this question of space.

Carlson (25:00): You sort of threw that out parenthetically, but like, what? I've never heard that before. So, you believe that going back 30 years, people in the U.S. government and in the finance world wanted money? Well, it wasn't the U.S. government; it was the central banking. If you look at the group of people who meet through the BIS, what's that?

Fitts (25:19): The BIS, or the Bank for International Settlements, is the central bank of central banks. Where is it located? It's in Basel, Switzerland, and it has 63 of the most powerful central banks as its members. The New York Fed and the Federal Reserve are both shareholders.

Carlson (25:36): They became shareholders in 1994. In one sentence, what's the purpose of the Bank of International Settlements? OK, so there are two things you need to know about the Bank of International Settlements. I'm not sure my brain's big enough for this, but keep going. It is OK; it has sovereign immunity. What does that mean?

Fitts (25:53): It's above the law. It's its own country. Right. It's its own country. It has its own police force. And essentially, other than one of its staff being in a car accident or minor issues, no one has the legal authority to move against it. OK.

Carlson (26:09): And sovereign immunity. That's number one. Number two, it can move money and hold it on its bank account, on its balance sheet, and manage money secretly. So, if I want to—I'm grossly oversimplifying—if I want to steal 21 trillion from the U.S. government and park it on the balance sheet of the BIS, it can move it anywhere in the world and keep it on its balance sheet secretly.

Fitts (26:37): Why would there be an organization? But first of all, where does its power come from—who empowered it to have sovereign immunity? It was created after World War I, and it gradually collected its powers and got going in the 1930s. It was created, in theory, to manage the reparations of the German government.

Carlson (26:56): But if you read real history, it was because the Bank of England and the central bankers wanted an entity that had sovereign immunity. They wanted to be able to move money secretly. For example, if you look at what happened during World War II and all the money that was moving back and forth between the Germans and Americans, Dulles was in Switzerland helping to facilitate these transfers.

Fitts (27:21): So, there's a wonderful book called *The Tower of Basel* by a talented Hungarian journalist, in which he documents and describes the entire history of the Bank of International Settlements. If you want to understand power in this world, understanding how the Bank of International Settlements and the plumbing of the central banking system work is very, very important.

Carlson (27:44): I've always been worried that if I knew more, I would become mentally ill. No, no. So I just have to say that reality is sort of the door you open to find real solutions. There are real solutions, and the biggest obstacle to implementing them is that nobody wants to face it.

Fitts (28:06): So you used to have a pass-through. Nobody wants to face the truth about how things happen. Facing the truth is never easy, and I understand that because the hardest thing I ever had to do, Tucker, was look in the mirror and say, "I'm the patsy." I was the assistant secretary of housing. I didn't know, and I went along; I didn't face this.

Carlson (28:23): I should have seen this faster. I should have said, "I'm the Patsy," and that was it. Sometimes, it's harder than facing death to admit that you've been part of, you know, a big lie and that you've been tricked. As someone who advocated for the Iraq War on television, I've lived this to some extent.

Fitts (28:41): Extent no. Yes, I did. Well, you know, part of facing this is forgiving yourself. You really have to. I used to have a pastor who would say, "If we can face it, God can fix it," because you have to understand we can't fix it. There are many, many things we can do to change the course.

Carlson (29:00): And I believe ultimately freedom can prevail, and there are many things we can do to help that happen. But ultimately, this is a spiritual war, and you have to call on God, you have to call on the divine, and that's where the battle is ultimately going to be decided.

Fitts (29:18): And that means, literally, I believe this is true: the divine intelligence cannot go to work unless we're willing to face it. You know, we have to look at it. We have to pray, ask for help, and deal with it. The real solutions will be cultural.

Carlson (29:36): There will be millions of people acting in their own lives, refusing to be controlled individually. Very, very wise of you to say that; I think it's true, and thank you for saying it. I want to go one more time to the space question.

Fitts (29:53): So, you said that people with power at the central banks decided that we need to sort of colonize space or move toward space. Did that happen? So, here's what happened, and we have two wrap-ups, and I think I sent them to you.

Carlson (30:11): One is we published in 2015 called "Space: Here We Go," and it has a picture of a businessman taking off in a spaceship. Then, in 2017, after a couple of the big investment banks wrote significant reports about space investment, we published one called "The Space-Based Economy."

Fitts (30:30): And then we tracked space on the Solaire report. I would refer you to that, but I think, first of all, you've seen a lot of capital centralized into a few billionaires who then reinvest that money in space.

Carlson (30:51): So, Musk, Bezos— you know, there is clearly a centralization of capital and reinvestment. So, the idea of space is what I mean— just the biggest possible picture. Why would you be interested in space? I'd say this is for someone who isn't.

Fitts (31:07): Right. So, let me give you a couple of reasons why. First of all, the miners are looking for a variety of different resources. There are practical reasons—if you can reduce the costs, you would want to do asteroid mining. The most significant economic factor is control, which is most easily implemented by satellites.

Carlson (31:29): So, you want to put up a whole ring of satellites that, combined with telecommunications, can basically help run the control grid—and not just the control grid in the West. The control grid—if you're going to shift huge amounts of money globally—how are you going to track and enforce that your money is being properly invested?

Fitts (31:51): Well, you need a control grid globally. So I think that's part of it. The last thing, and I don't know the answer to this, is that I think there is real concern about geophysical risks, and one way to deal with that is to make sure we don't bet the ranch on one planet.

Carlson (32:09): So, to that end, if we could just linger on that. Thank you for that. That'll make sense if we just linger on one question. So, geophysical risks. We've been lectured for, I don't know, 30 years now about climate change. Climate change is obviously an ongoing feature of life on this planet.

Fitts (32:25): The glacier is just an OP. So, of course, it's an OP, and I think we, you know, people have figured that out. But that doesn't mean that smart, highly informed people aren't worried about geophysical risks.

Carlson (32:41): They are, and I know some of them. So, what do you think those risks are that honest, smart people who are interested in self-preservation and thriving are worried about? Like, what are the risks they're concerned about? I think the first is a solar minimum, which could cause significant drops in the economy and agriculture, making it difficult to feed the population.

Fitts (33:02): So, because there are changes in climate due to the Earth's distance from the sun, right? And that causes changes. Right. So, throughout history, we go through periods of solar minimum. Solar minimum is the name. I think it's called solar minimum. I'm not an expert in any of this, so... They are worried about climate change, but they don't think it's coming from our suburb.

Carlson (33:22): Right. It's not coming from human behavior. Now, there are environmental problems stemming from human behavior, and those are correct. So, that's one. Do you think that risk is real? I don't know. For the record, I have one friend who is very well-informed and has convinced me that it is real—that they are very concerned about water.

Fitts (33:46): If you look at the history of solar minimums and what they do, there was a Russian researcher—I can't remember if he's an economist or a scientist—who did a lot of research on the stock market and solar activity. If you're a central banker in charge of managing the financial system, that reality would make me very nervous.

Carlson (34:10): So, okay, I think there’s something worth understanding. The other thing is, every 10,000 to 12,000 years, it appears to me, if you go back through history, we have some kind of huge disaster.

Fitts (34:26): An extinction event. An extinction, a near-extinction event. So, I don't know if you've ever read the science fiction book *The Three-Body Problem*. No, it's fascinating. It's one of the top Chinese science fiction books, and it's about… I've read no Chinese science fiction.

Carlson (34:43): OK, I'm feeling very ignorant this morning. No, no, no, no. Because, here's the thing. I'm just trying to figure out what in the world is going on. Yeah, amen. We'll start. I'm in the same place. And so that always, as you know, leads you to the most. Does it, right? It does.

Fitts (34:59): Right. So, in one instance, I think the thing that got me to read *The Three-Body Problem* was when Obama made some cryptic comment about people ought to read this book. It was like a hint, hint— you know, here are the problems I'm dealing with. *The Three-Body Problem* is about other bodies that come into the solar system, and you...

Carlson (35:22): It's impossible to predict their trajectory. And then, when they do, they create catastrophic flooding, earthquakes, and all sorts of other issues. But I think that, whether it's a pole shift or a magnetic pole shift, it's one of the theories explaining what causes these events.

Fitts (35:42): But there is a history of near-extinction events. One of the things I’ve looked at is, because I’m trying to figure out, in the period between fiscal 1998 and fiscal 2015, there were 21 trillion dollars of undocumented adjustments in the U.S. government.

Carlson (35:59): If you go to our website, missingmoney.slayer.com, we have years and years of documentation, including government financials that show this. So, the question is, where is all this money going? One of the things I've looked at in the process of examining where all this money is going is the underground base and city infrastructure and transportation system that has been built.

Fitts (36:23): And I'm sorry. Yes, we have built an extraordinary number of underground bases and supposedly transportation systems. Some of these are documented as part of the national security infrastructure.

Carlson (36:40): I think there are many more, both in the United States and all over the world. From 2021 to 2023, I worked with one of the smartest subscribers in the Slayer Report network. He and I spent two years collecting all the data and allegations about underground bases.

Fitts (37:07): And then we systematically went through and tried to estimate our guess. This is totally a guess of how many underground bases there are, both underground in the United States and beneath the ocean around the United States.

Carlson (37:24): And our estimate was 170, with the transportation network connecting them. And what would be the purpose? The purpose, if you thought you were going to experience a near-extinction event. So, to me, there are two purposes. You have so many activities going on that you need to keep secret, that you're essentially building the capacity to do so. For example, if you're conducting a secret space program, you need to shield it from things that can't be seen.

Fitts (37:53): But I think, if you're worried about a near-extinction event, you know, that's... So I know nothing about this other than my only window into it. I knew a contractor who worked on one in Washington, D.C., and I remember him telling me about a power box, like a transformer box on Constitution Ave., which he told me, because he worked on it personally, was actually the exit—the egress—from the White House that was accessible by vehicle.

Carlson (38:26): I thought, really? He goes, "Oh yeah, no, I installed it." I know. And I thought, well, that's kind of crazy. Then, in the middle of this big city where I live—on Constitution Ave.—every day, you could build something like that without me knowing. Under the VP's house at the Naval Observatory—same thing.

Fitts (38:44): I think most people know that. Next to my brother's house on Macomb Street in DC. So. Also, I, like, but that's—I always thought that was preparation for nuclear war. Like, I didn't really think about it that much. Yeah, it's preparation for catastrophe. So, do you think there are facilities like that in other places outside DC?

Carlson (39:04): Oh yeah. So, if you're interested, we have a great interview. I did an interview with Richard Dolan about underground bases on the Solari Report. It's sort of an introduction to the topic and is based on a lot of the research by a guy named Richard Souder, whom it's very hard to interview.

Fitts (39:21): So Richard went through all the material, and, you know, clearly it's—I don't know if you ever saw the Washington Post did a project in 2010 or 2012 called Top Secret America.

Carlson (39:36): And one of the reporters, it was a team of two, put together a database of all the different top-secret installations that had been built in the country, including those constructed since the Patriot Act. What you saw was just this explosion of money and the building of so many facilities, both underground and above ground.

Fitts (39:59): Not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies. You probably have heard about 8 Sleep by now. They have developed the country's most innovative products for sleep. Almost everybody in our office uses something they make called the Pod, and they love it. And there's a reason that professional athletes and many other smart people do, too.

Carlson (40:16): You add the pod to your mattress like a mattress cover, and it helps you get a better night's sleep and feel filled with vitality at the start of each day. In an almost intimidating way. It's amazing. How does it do it? Well, it uses advanced technology to track your sleep and automatically adjust the temperature of your side of the bed to what's perfect for sleep.

Fitts (40:34): And temperature makes all the difference. It's backed by over 600 million hours of data. They've also used those insights to create their new product, Sleep Elixir, to help you get quiet before you go to bed, fall asleep faster, and stay knocked out longer. No grogginess, no weird side effects—just better deep sleep.

Carlson (40:52): So, if you're ready to take sleep and recovery to the next level, go to eightsleep.com/tucker to get $350 off your Pod for Ultra. Full refund within 30 days if you don't love it. It works—just as a theological matter.

Fitts (41:07): I hate to say this, but I think it's true. If you're building a lot underground, you're on the wrong side. I just don't think that's a good sign. So, I'll tell you something very funny. Right, like, just, let's just start with the obvious first.

Carlson (41:23): That's not good. So I'll tell you a very funny story. After I left the Bush administration, I went on the board of Sallie Mae, and I am still on the board of Sallie Mae.

Fitts (41:39): And after one of the first meetings, there's a wonderful stop. I don't think you've been talking about underground bases and colonizing space, and you clearly seem totally sane, but I'm sure some people think, well, she's obviously crazy. I should have set the stage at the beginning with your biography—like you're as mainstream.

Carlson (41:55): You're on the board of Sallie Mae. You're a partner at Dylan Reed. It's like, right. You're not just on the Internet, right? I'm sorry. I just want to say that this is a former high-level federal official who’s on the board of Sallie Mae and a partner at Dylan Reed.

Fitts (42:13): OK, I just want to say it out loud. So, I'm on the board, and there was a lovely chairman—a really lovely guy. He comes out and says, "Can I talk to you after the meeting?" And I said, "Sure." He then pulls out this big, glossy brochure for the Council on Foreign Relations.

Carlson (42:29): And he said the time has come for you to join. He said, "We want you to ask Nick."  
"Nick, are you ready to sponsor me?" I said to him.  
"Sam, I just don't want to do this. I really don't want to do this."  
He looked shocked.  
He said, "You don't understand."

Fitts (42:45): If you don't do this, you're out forever. And just at that moment—just at that moment—you know, it's these moments when things come to you. I saw in my mind—I'm very pictorial. I saw in my mind a locker in the underground base, and they were taking my name off the locker. I thought, I thought, you know, if it comes to that, I'll take my chances upstairs—the way to play.

Carlson (43:12): Yeah, me too. And I said, "But it's this, it's a, you know, something." It's at the deepest root. It's a spiritual and cultural question. Totally agree. Who's cowering underground, like in dark places? No. But to me, there's nothing wrong with going into a bunker if they're bombing.

Fitts (43:29): OK, you know, I don't have a problem with that, but I really didn't want to be with all of them in a concentrated space. It was like, no, I'd rather not. And you know them. At this, you're not guessing; you know a lot of these people. I know a lot of these people, and the one thing I will say is that, if there's anything I learned from my history, the problem is not that they are bad and we are good.

Carlson (43:54): That's not how this works. The evil and the good are threaded at every level of society, every community, every enterprise. It doesn't work like that. Well, I'm not especially good. I know that. I know that for a fact. So, I think you're pretty good.

Fitts (44:09): Yeah, but of course you know more about yourself than anyone else does. And I know that I am a flawed person. So I'll never declare myself outright, you know. I'll never say that God is on my side. I'll say I want to be on God's side. But it's an open question. Well, it's a journey.

Carlson (44:25): It's never over, and we're not perfect, but you try every day to do your best, you know. It's like baseball—you get some hits some days and strike out others. But you believe that there's a whole constellation of underground bases built by the U.S. government in the United States, just the physical infrastructure alone. Because normally, we talk...

Fitts (44:48): About what are they doing? What's unbelievable and like? It raises lots of practical questions. How do you ventilate them? What about food and water supply, you know? Where's the energy? Are we using breakthrough energy or... Where's the energy coming from? Right, right. Because I'm sure that we have the ability to produce breakthrough energy at very low cost, you know, if you go back and start.

Carlson (45:11): With that, my Dutch partners. I met them because they were organizing a series of conferences on breakthrough energy, bringing together inventors from around the world. You can see all the videos on the Internet. I really went through the history from Tesla onward, learning about different inventors who have discovered and claimed various innovations related to breakthrough energy.

Fitts (45:36): And I'm convinced that this energy exists. I'm also convinced that if you look at many of the really fast ships flying around the planet, you know that they are not using classical electricity.

Carlson (45:51): Releasing, right? So, you know. They're not running on diesel. Right, exactly. So, yeah. So, we know that these—I'm sorry, I get so caught up in the details—but we know that there are a quite a large number of underground bases in the United States.

Fitts (46:12): We can state that as a fact. And then the question becomes, of course, whether they are connected to the power grid. If they are pulling power from a conventional natural gas electricity generation station, you could know that and measure it. But you think they have independent energy sources.

Carlson (46:28): Of course they do. So, one of the questions I have that I think is really important is: when you look at breakthrough energy, if you were running the planet. So, I have this nickname for the committee at the top—Mr. Global.

Fitts (46:44): If you were Mr. Global, you would not want to implement breakthrough energy on a widespread basis for a variety of reasons, one of which is that everybody would get a hold of it and weaponize it. It could be very dangerous. Why? My understanding is that literally one small group of people, with no sovereign powers or organized crime, could take this and use it in a way that could weaponize it and make it very dangerous.

Carlson (47:12): I don't, I mean, I'm not a scientist. I don't really understand. But energy, by definition, is dangerous. You know, gasoline is dangerous, right? Right. Electricity is dangerous. Of course, nuclear energy is dangerous, right? But if you're the risk manager and you're in charge of managing the planet, you know, this has more disruption capability—both weaponization and economic—suddenly everybody's free to do whatever they want.

Fitts (47:35): And so, they're much harder to control. So, if you're Mr. Global and you have the capacity to dramatically lower the energy cost, the other danger is that the population skyrockets, and you're concerned about that. So, if you're Mr. Global and you're worried about what will happen if you bring this technology out, it's very convenient to gain complete control.

Carlson (47:59): If you don't trust the population to be environmentally or politically responsible, then complete control is necessary. I have a good mutual friend who's been bothering me for years to interview you. You've got to interview her. I'm so glad.

Fitts (48:16): Well, just because she's, he said. This is the most informed, smartest, most reasonable, mainstream, sane person I know of, he said. This, and I was like, yeah, OK, anyway. We're just really glad we did this interview because you're blowing my mind up and down. So, how convinced are you that breakthrough energy, alternative forms of energy, and non-publicly disclosed forms of energy are in use by the US government?

Carlson (48:46): I think there's a very high chance that they're being used in some kind of controlled, secret way. Yeah, well, there are tons of indications, and you've had a number of people—like at the contractor level, such as federal contractors, electricians, or concrete workers.

Fitts (49:04): And I was working on this underground facility. There are a number of people who come forward to say this, and I saw what appeared to be some brand new form of energy. I didn't understand it at first. Insane people too. Shawn Ryan, who's a friend of mine—wonderful guy, honest man. There's a podcaster who interviewed this guy, who was just a random blue-collar guy.

Carlson (49:23): I think he was a concrete guy, you know, and he received a call for a million yards of concrete or whatever. He went to this underground DoD facility and saw clear signs of some energy source that defied the laws of known physics.

Fitts (49:39): There are a bunch of people who have said stuff like that. So I don't think it's crazy. I have two businesses: one is the Solaria Report, and the other is Solaria Screens. I do investment screening, and I think a lot has to shift in investing if we're going to have a real civilization and avoid misallocation.

Carlson (49:56): I think we're misallocating capital terribly anyway. But he has been an investor in a breakthrough energy company for 30 years. So, when you know... Yeah, yeah. And it's called Brilliant Light. You can go look at their website, and they're really, you know, they swear they've got it.

Fitts (50:16): And what is it? Don't ask me. Yeah, you’ve got to get him on. So, you think this money has been taken by people who've really thought through the future and are determined to survive it?

Carlson (50:33): So, I think I call it a financial coup. I believe what happened was that when the budget deal collapsed in 1995, they gave up on the government. They just said, you know, this form of government will not work as a governance structure to manage the dollar system.

Fitts (50:55): They're right about that. And, you know, they just felt it was impossible. If you're a risk manager, you have to turn the aircraft carrier before you hit the iceberg. And that could be 20 years before, do you know what I mean? And they just felt that the system wasn't working and that it required gaining consensus.

Carlson (51:16): You just had to dumb people down and buy them off, and it just wasn't working. So I think they decided, OK, we're going to re-engineer government using the "just do it" method. The first thing we're going to do is pull all the money out. We're going to put the government in a debt trap, then squeeze it and shift to the control model.

Fitts (51:35): And it was a financial coup that started in fiscal 1998. It began literally on October 1st, 1997. By 2015, they had accumulated 21. We had reports in their financials of 21 trillion dollars of undocumented adjustments.

Carlson (51:51): From a cash standpoint, that could be 50, it could be 50 trillion or 10 trillion. There's no way to tell unless you can get access to the bank records. Then, what happened was that Dr. Mark Skidmore of Michigan State University and I published a study—sort of a survey we had done, thanks to him and his students—that announced we were up to 21 trillion at that point.

Fitts (52:18): Then, the next step that happened: remember the Kavanaugh hearings very well, OK. What you don't remember is that during the Kavanaugh hearings, the White House, the Senate, and the House Republicans and Democrats all together issued an administrative policy called Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board Statement 56.

Carlson (52:43): Yeah, I did miss that. I'll just say I did miss that. I was busy watching Kavanaugh talk about his teenage drinking or whatever. And what that policy said is that, as a matter of administrative policy, we do not have to obey the constitutional provisions related to financial budgeting and disclosure.

Fitts (53:00): We do not have to obey the laws, and we do not have to obey the regulations. What we can do is appoint a secret group of people through a secret process to move money out of the financial disclosures of the United States and 150.

Carlson (53:19): So, it's the 24 covered agencies plus approximately 150 governmental entities. When you include the classification laws and the national security laws, it also applies to the big banks and contractors working for the U.S. government.

Fitts (53:37): Now let me explain what this means as a matter of investment. When I look at the US large-cap stock market or the US bond market—the Treasury market—I find no financial disclosures that have any meaningful value. Everything is secret. I have no idea what it means if I examine the financials of a New York Fed member bank that is managing the New York or US Treasury Department's bank accounts, or if I review the Treasury's financial statements—they all seem meaningless.

Carlson (54:08): They don't mean anything. What's missing, you can't know. All you can know is that a secret group of people can make anything they want go missing, and you can't know what it is. It's all secret. So I'm looking at half the cake, but I don't know which part of the cake is missing.

Fitts (54:29): So, it's meaningless. You don't even know if it is half. Right. I, I, I don't know it; it's, you know, it has reached a level of absurdity where, but the absurd thing is, as a legal matter, to take the position that an administrative policy agreed upon by the UNI party can overrule the Constitution, the laws, and the regulations—simply by, you know, like waving a wand and, suddenly, magically, law doesn't matter.

Carlson (55:08): I mean, now you're talking, and you also saw this in the financial crisis: a decision was made by Eric Holder in the Department of Justice not to prosecute HSBC. There's a wonderful video on the Best Evidence channel by John Titus about this whole thing.

Fitts (55:24): And basically, what they said is that a systemically important institution is defined under the BIS, which refers to the Financial Stability Board's definition of a financially systemically important institution.

Carlson (55:40): These institutions are free to break the law with—no, they're free to break the law. At most, all they have to do is kick back a piece of the profits to the Department of Justice. So, it's like a formal kickback system. And what you're saying is that you're taking the sovereign immunity of the BIS and extending it to the banks that are running these operations through the New York Fed?

Fitts (56:04): J.P. Morgan and the rest. Bank of America, yeah. Right. So, what you've done with the BIS, the IMF, the World Bank, and the UN is create all these different organizations. If you look at what we've done—about 40 organizations in Latin America—you've created an international overlay of organizations that have various forms of sovereign immunity, of course, the biggest being the BIS.

Carlson (56:31): And so, if they are free to break the law— I mean, if you look at the financial crisis— what you're saying is these companies can lose trillions of dollars, have it replaced by the taxpayer, and keep on going. So now is the point of the conversation where I have to ask the other question: who are these people?

Fitts (56:50): So, can you name some of the people whom you believe are making these decisions, whose decisions are effectively, as you just said above, beyond the law and have effective immunity? Sort of, who is Mr. Global? In my experience, the bureaucracy that sort of runs things is the central banking bureaucracy.

Carlson (57:09): We've described the BIS and the central bankers. So, think of the planet as a house. You have the house itself, then you have financing for the house—that's the mortgage. Then, you have the insurance. And, you know, if you don't have insurance, then you have the equity in the house, right?

Fitts (57:26): And the insurance layer is very, very important to ensure that the equity is protected, right? Okay. So, you've got the real assets, the banking system, the insurance system, and then you've got the owners. In my experience, if you go to the BIS and look at the systemically important institutions and the members, you know, that's the bureaucracy that runs the debt and transaction system.

Carlson (57:52): So, you know, the transactions, because the whole thing depends on being able to swap and transact. The insurance group is very important for the reasons you just described, same as with your house. And then the question is, who are the real owners?

Fitts (58:08): And that's the mystery. I've spent my whole life trying to figure out who the real owners are. Based on my experience, if you know their names, they're not among the important owners. Do you know what I mean? It's intergenerational pools of capital.

Carlson (58:26): Now, here's what's interesting. One of the most powerful pools of intergenerational capital I have ever dealt with is the Harvard endowment. And if you look at the squabble going on over who controls the Harvard endowment right now, it's a very interesting dispute.

Fitts (58:42): Can you summarize that? Well, you have the Trump administration and the Department of Justice now in a lawsuit with Harvard over who has what powers over Harvard's policies. But I think the big fight is not, you know, an asymmetrical warfare.

Carlson (59:03): The fight is never what the fight is really about. The real fight is about who controls the Harvard Corporation; the university is only a portion of the Harvard Corporation. The Harvard Corporation runs the university, and it manages the endowment.

Fitts (59:22): OK. And the Harvard Corporation, in my experience, is one of the most important investment syndicates in the world. Because they have a tax exemption, they don't have to pay taxes. They spin off, I think the last time I looked—I don't know what it is currently—but they spin off about 4% a year for the university, which is a lot cheaper than paying taxes.

Carlson (59:42): And it's a great investment because the university provides all sorts of intellectual and human capital to the investment syndicate, you know, so it's a very brilliant, elegant model. My theory is that it was a model created to compete with the Vatican and the Catholics, who had 2,000 years of diplomatic immunity and no taxes anyway.

Fitts (1:00:05): So, so, but it is. The Harvard Corporation is run by a perpetuating board, so the board members, if a board member leaves, they pick a new one. So, it's a perpetually self-perpetuating board. And my guess is that behind the scenes, if there's a fight, one of the fights is over who gets onto that board.

Carlson (1:00:24): Because you then control a $50 billion-plus endowment and a $50 billion-plus endowment, which now has a 39% private equity portfolio. These are, you know—I, I said to On Money and Markets, which is our show—I said the other week, if this is a Monopoly board, that would be Park Place because it's such a flagship in the world of investment.

Fitts (1:00:47): It's such a major leader. What would happen if the Congress decided on the new tax bill to tax university endowments? Which they should do. I don't know because...

Carlson (1:01:03): That will happen at the same time. Something else is going to happen, and these things are going to happen simultaneously. The thing that will impact the universities is, if you look at how much money it cost you as a father to put one child through college, you're talking about enormous bills.

Fitts (1:01:28): And if you look at how far the universities have gotten away from providing a great education, it's not a good investment. So, when I was an investment advisor, I used to work with my clients' kids, and we would literally do something.

Carlson (1:01:47): We have a learning plan on Solari now that came out of this. I would literally make them price time and money for each course they take, by course. And I would basically make them say, "Look, what do you want to do in this life, and what are the skills and tools you need to achieve it?"

Fitts (1:02:06): And how are we going to go get those tools with the least amount of your time and your parents' money? How are we really going to do it? And we would come up with these wild education plans, like going to San Francisco for this audio-visual course, and then the next year, they would be in Budapest studying at the university.

Carlson (1:02:27): You know, because you want your kids to learn about the world, and you want them to be, you know, not provincial or stuck. You want them to be educated. Yeah, you want them to be educated. Anyway. But we would come up with these very creative ideas, and what you discover is that in a world of YouTube University and access to extraordinary resources all around the world, it's possible to get a great education.

Fitts (1:02:54): The universities in the United States have become unbelievably bloated and off track. I think everyone senses that. They are a terrible investment if you're a loving parent. You love your children, and you want them to be successful.

Carlson (1:03:12): If I want my child to be successful in the world we're heading into, whether it turns into a control grid or the control grid—as I believe it will fail—you know, you want them to have an outstanding education. And I will tell you bluntly, the reason the unipolar model failed is because we don't have a culture that can field and manage either.

Fitts (1:03:34): That's exactly right. We don't have the human capital to run the world. We don't have the human capital, but we're teaching our human capital to adopt a culture that cannot succeed. Exactly right. So, if you're going to run the world, you need Eaton and Sandhurst to provide an administrative class that is tough, clear-thinking, and has a well-defined mission.

Carlson (1:03:56): I don't start sacrificing. You need Christianity well. Well, both of those, you know. Certainly, Eden was a Christian school, right? You. If you're going to be part of a project that lasts longer than a lifetime, then you have to understand that, at the root, this is about your immortal soul, and your soul is immortal.

Fitts (1:04:20): And that triggers a very different way of looking at the world and a very different way of thinking. And then you have to be able to collaborate across time and space in very powerful ways. That takes trust and faith. You have to be agreement-capable, and you can't run a unipolar model, let alone a successful multipolar model, unless you're agreement-capable.

Carlson (1:04:43): So, this is Lavrov's term, and this is what the Russians understood. This is why they whooped our ass in Ukraine. They are capable of agreement, and we are not. Now, we're sure you've heard plenty of those free phone promises from America's biggest wireless carriers. If those deals sound too good to be true, it's probably because they often are.

Fitts (1:05:01): They come with layers of fine print, requiring you to sign up for four lines, plus activation fees, plus plus plus this and that. The other thing? You don't even understand what you're signing up for, and by the time you're done, you've paid for that free phone three times. It was a pretty expensive free phone.

Carlson (1:05:18): It's kind of a scam, honestly. Our wireless company is called Pure Talk, and it offers a much better and more straightforward deal, with no strings whatsoever attached. With a qualifying plan of just $35 a month, you can legitimately get the brand-new Samsung Galaxy A26 for free.

Fitts (1:05:35): It's actually free. There aren't any hidden costs. You're not signing up for the rest of your life or promising to name your kid after them or anything. From virtually indestructible Gorilla Glass to next-generation camera lenses, the phone has basically everything you want. All you need to do is switch to Pure Talk. Thirty-five dollars a month for unlimited talk, text, and fifteen gigs of data with mobile hotspot—all on America's most dependable 5G network.

Carlson (1:05:59): Go to puretalk.com/talker to claim your free Samsung Galaxy with a qualifying plan when you switch to Pure Talk Wireless by Americans for Americans. Man, there's so much. Let me just move back once again to something you said about policymakers, Congress, the central banks, and the White House giving up on the American model in the mid-90s when the budget deal failed. I think you said it was 1995.

Fitts (1:06:29): I vaguely remember that, you know, this democratic system or whatever version of a democratic system we have. Our system is incapable of self-perpetuating in the long term. It's just too dysfunctional. And that's obviously true. It's too corrupt.

Carlson (1:06:46): It's clearly true. Everyone senses that this isn't working. We're going to get a new system. They figured that out 30 years ago. The one kind of brick wall looming right in the windshield is the debt—specifically, the debt meltdown. I mean, Ray Dalio talks about it every single day, saying we have too much debt.

Fitts (1:07:03): People are going to stop buying our debt because it's clearly a bad deal. And like, what happens then? You suggested the control grid is, in part, designed to manage the population during that moment, maybe or to. Yeah, in part, yeah. So, if you want to move people to a much lower economic footprint, let alone do it on a shocking basis, having complete control is obviously very concerning.

Carlson (1:07:27): OK. So, the bottom line is that everybody is about to get a lot poorer. Not everybody, but a lot. The majority is about to get a lot poorer. It depends on how they do it—that is, if you bring out breakthrough energy, you can soften the blow. There are many things you can do to soften the blow. It doesn't have to be like Russia in 1990 and 1991.

Fitts (1:07:44): It doesn't have to be. Can they do it that way? Yes, they can. So, it comes down to who governs and whether they want to do it. One of my favorite lines is from Tina Turner. She says, "We can do this nice or rough, and we could do it nice, or we can do it rough."

Carlson (1:08:01): There. There are ways of doing the control grid nicely, and we can do it roughly. And what are they planning? I don't know. To a certain extent. In my experience, the way they govern is that they set targets and goals, and then, you know, they sort of make it up as they go. Sometimes it works, and it’s very fluent.

Fitts (1:08:20): So I wonder if the AI, if the data center boom, which really is the only crackling, sparkling piece of the real estate market right now. I think it's building data centers for the development market. Just call them control grids. Control grids. Control. I mean, look, I think they're control.

Carlson (1:08:35): Nodes, I'm totally opposed to it. But massive bets—economic bets—on the success of AI, right? And the missing piece is energy—how do you power all that? And we're already, as you pointed out, in an analysis. You have to bring out the breakthrough energy—that's what.


Fitts (1:08:50): I'm saying it like either. They're going to build it on coal deposits in Wyoming, or—which is going to be kind of hard—they're going to have to say that all that climate stuff we've been yelling at you about for 30 years is total bullshit. Now we're burning coal. Well, there was just an article in Bloomberg about Texas.

Carlson (1:09:07): It needs 30 new nuclear plants, and the Chinese are building enormous numbers of nuclear plants. Yeah, and there are risks in nuclear—I mean, every one. I'm a right winger, and I've always defended nuclear, but let's be totally honest: it's not risk-free, big time. Well, here's the thing—how do you govern and manage nuclear plants with leadership that's not entirely agreement-capable and also...

Fitts (1:09:28): In a country that isn't producing enough people in the hard sciences, not enough engineers, right? So no, there are huge problems with that. But that question is being forced on policymakers: what do you do about energy? What do you do about energy? What do you mean—wind and solar?

Carlson (1:09:44): Like we're going to be laughing about that in five years because it's just silly. Well, one of the things you can do about energy is depopulate, right? Right. And I know for a fact—I'm not guessing at this—that there are people running countries around the world who've thought about, like, what does AI mean for my population?

Fitts (1:10:01): It means I have too many people. So, this is something I know for a fact. I'm not guessing that leaders of countries are talking about each other; I know that. And I'm not saying they're committing genocide or anything like that, but they are just looking at harsh statistics.

Carlson (1:10:17): They're right. Exactly. There's another thing I don't understand very well. I've just listened to people, but if you listen to Sean Parker saying he's going to live to 145, or there's an interview where the president's son-in-law says, you know, we're going to be the last generation to die or the first generation to live forever.

Fitts (1:10:39): So, you clearly have a group of biohackers who think they can achieve massive longevity. It makes me want to start smoking again. I'm just being honest—I don't want to be. I just want to move. I want to pivot away from that level of soul-destroying hubris because, honestly, that's what it is.

Carlson (1:10:55): I'm God. No, you're not, and you're going to find out the hard way that you're not. So, it does make me want to write. But what I'm saying is, if you truly believe you can do that and you're not going to allow the general population to do it for environmental reasons, then you would be for depopulation.

Fitts (1:11:11): Of course, you know that's totally true. So, this is again in Fairfield. Do you think there's evidence that people will be living to 145? I have no idea. I don't either. I don't really care. In other words, there's a whole set of scenarios I don't care about. I'm interested in freedom, and I believe that the only way we can be free is through a culture that embraces the divine and builds true, enduring, and living wealth—not just financial wealth.

Carlson (1:11:41): What is true wealth? True wealth? Well, you know, I would say you're truly, truly wealthy. I feel I am right. I don't have that much money, but I feel that way. Well, it's an integration of living equity with financial equity. And what I learned, being a financial advisor, is that everyone had been taught to build financial equity, but they couldn't integrate it with living equity.

Fitts (1:12:06): So you'd work with somebody who's worth millions of dollars but says they can't afford organic food. I was like, are you crazy? You know, the number one thing that causes a diminution of family wealth is health problems, healthcare fraud, and healthcare bankruptcy.

Carlson (1:12:25): It's like, you know, please take $1,000,000 out of your bank account and start investing in really building, doing everything you and your family need to be truly healthy—having perfect water, great food, etc.

Fitts (1:12:40): The other thing I discovered was that everyone was trying to put their money into the national security state instead of helping their kids buy homes and build living equity. My mother's family were Quakers, and you didn't even think about buying stock until you had sent all your kids to the best Quaker schools.

Carlson (1:13:00): You know, that was like, that was the first. Do you think it's your dropping so much here? I'm just trying to pause, like, tease out certain themes. But do you think it's wiser, you know, if you have children and you care about them, to help them buy homes rather than absolutely who?

Fitts (1:13:17): Who's so? Can I? There are two stories I'm dying to tell you, please. OK, during the litigation, you know. You get into the situation of litigation. So I litigated with the Department of Justice for eleven years. Or actually, some of that involved fisticuffs with the tax guys.

Carlson (1:13:37): But anyway, I had the sort of enemy of the state process: I had 18 audits, investigations, 12 tracks of litigation, a smear campaign, and physical harassment. So, they didn't like what you were saying? They didn't like the idea that I would try to stop.

Fitts (1:13:54): The mortgage bubble— they really wanted to have a mortgage bubble, and we were doing things to bring disclosure to play. It's called place-based financials. I really believed that if local communities could see how all the money worked in their neighborhood, we could change things.

Carlson (1:14:14): So, for example, when I was at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I would constantly find neighborhoods where we were spending $250,000 per unit to build public housing, and $50,000 would buy and rehab a defaulted or foreclosed property in the FHA inventory.

Fitts (1:14:35): And so, literally, if you could just within a four- or ten-block area, take that $250,000 and spend it in the most efficient way in that place, you could get four or five homes for the price of one. It was really amazing when I looked at those numbers.

Carlson (1:14:52): We did all sorts of due diligence. This was when I was a contractor for the woman who worked for the guy who ran the $250,000 program. I showed it to her and said, "Look, we could, you know, in New Orleans, Chicago, LA, get four or five homes for the price of one."

Fitts (1:15:10): And she turned bright red. She said, "But how would we generate fees for our friends, exactly right? Or how would we? You know, pay off foreign countries that influence our political system with donations? If you know, we're actually spending it to build nice houses for Americans. Well, we could be spending it in Reading, PA, or in some other place, instead of some disgusting Middle Eastern country."

Carlson (1:15:30): So, if you look at place-based financial statements, there's an extraordinary opportunity to re-engineer what's already there—without taking money from anybody else and making improvements ourselves. I really thought that if we created a software tool called Community Wizard, it would allow everyone on the Internet to download the data and start exploring how the money works in their communities, revealing real opportunities.

Fitts (1:15:55): Okay, so let me tell you two stories. The litigation starts, and literally, you go from being very wealthy, very trusted, and very prospected to being an enemy of the state. No one will talk to you, your phone becomes useless, and suddenly all your income stops—your income stops, your credit stops.

Carlson (1:16:16): You're just frozen. And by yours, you mean yours. Yeah. Yeah, so... so... Anyway, you know, you have the assets that you have. Luckily, they never turned off my bank account. So I was lucky that way. But one of the things that happened was they started—I had a farm in New Hampshire, and I sold my share to my uncle, a wonderful and very wealthy uncle who was like the patriarch. He bought it, and I warned him, "If you buy this, you know, they may come after you too."

Fitts (1:16:49): And he was a very stand-up guy, very fearless. And he said, you know, I'll deal with that. So, sure enough, I sold him the farmland. They called him and said, you know, your niece is a criminal, and you shouldn't be doing this, blah, blah, blah. And they also said, we want the financial records from the farm.

Carlson (1:17:08): We want all the financial records of the farm. He said, "Well, send me a letter so I can give it to my lawyer, and I'm happy to send them to you." So, they, you know, went to the summer farm where all the family goes anyway. Instead of sending him a letter, they showed up at his house in Portsmouth, NH, at 9:00 PM, with three FBI agents and an AIG representative carrying a subpoena.

Fitts (1:17:34): And it was designed to scare him. So, the family had a big powwow—should they drop me because they don't want to be targeted? And he said, well, you know, she always helped us. It turned out I counted it up; at that point, I had lent or given to family and friends $250,000. I just made a lot of money.

Carlson (1:18:01): I loved making money, and people needed help, and that's what money's for. So, that is what to restate. That is what money is for, so I just always don't. I hadn't even thought about it, by the way, your average 23-year-old NBA player who's supporting all of his cousins and his single mom.

Fitts (1:18:16): He understands that better than your average rich person. Your obligation is to your family and including with money. Sorry, right? Some of us are lucky, some are not. Amen. Right, so he said she helped everyone, so I'm going to help her. It took eleven years, but at the very least, it was 2006.

Carlson (1:18:37): So, that was about nine years. At the end of the process, when I won the litigation, I got AI, and we had money coming in. I sat down to either repay everyone who loaned or gifted me money, and I repaid almost everyone.

Fitts (1:18:54): So, I'm just gifted, and I counted it up, and what I realized is I had come into the litigation having loaned a quarter of a million, and then, over the next nine years, exactly a quarter of a million had come back.

Carlson (1:19:11): And it wasn't tit for tat. I mean, it was different people, different things. You know, some had received and said, "Well, I guess she needs it back," and repaid it. Or some had just gifted it because they knew I had gifted. And literally, I put a quarter of a million out, and a quarter of a million came back.

Fitts (1:19:26): And Tucker, if it weren't for that money, I wouldn't be here. I would have never made it through. It was because of the people, and they couldn't shut the people out. You know, they could—they could do all sorts of things to cut off resources and income.

Carlson (1:19:42): But if it's in the people around you and the people you love and trust, it comes back. So when I love that, yeah, it's great. When I finished the litigation, I had a 401(k) that I had to bust. It had $500,000 in it.

Fitts (1:19:59): I paid $225,000 in fines and taxes to get it out. Well, I don't think they thought they had put my 401(k) under audit, so I couldn't use it to finance the business. It was dirty tricks anyway. So I took the money out.

Carlson (1:20:14): So, my accountant, when we get the settlement money, she said, "Let's fund up the four O 1." Ki said, "No, I'm never going into business with the U.S. government again. No way. I don't want any of those vehicles. I'm out." And I said, "But the other thing is, I'm taking that $500,000 and bonusing it out on the People's Bank, and I'm going to start a new business. I think that business will be successful."

Fitts (1:20:38): So I don't need that 500,000. It'd be nice, but I don't need it. However, I need to get that money back from People's Bank because that is the only bank in this world I trust. So that's like a beautiful story. Well, here's the question. I used to always say this to my clients: who's going to be there for you, right?

Carlson (1:20:59): Who's going to be there for you? That's the People Bank, and you want to invest in the People Bank. Now, it may not be money; it may be time, help, or support. There's a wonderful book called *Family Wealth* by a guy named James Hughes. I don't know if you've ever heard of it or seen it.

Fitts (1:21:15): And basically, what he does. My great uncle didn't like the book so much. He said, "You're trying to turn our family into a corporation." I said, "No, I'm not, but it basically teaches a family how to conspire together. It involves having dinner once a month or whenever, and talking about what's in your heart to do."

Carlson (1:21:33): You know, this person wants to do this. This person wants to do that. Some things make money, some things don't, but they help each other be successful at whatever your passion is and work as a family. You know, I always say, Solari, we shouldn't worry about whether there is a conspiracy.

Fitts (1:21:51): If you're not in one, you need to start one. And a great family should be a conspiracy where you're trying to help each other succeed. I love that. Yeah. I mean, these are ancient and, with respect, very obvious points, exactly, but I don't think I've heard someone say it in a long time.

Carlson (1:22:10): Well, if we're going to build a successful culture, that culture has to be good at building wealth—living wealth and financial wealth—both on an integrated basis. So, if you come to Solari, we have a curriculum called Building Wealth, which has six pillars, and we organize all of our content around building wealth.

Fitts (1:22:33): And because it's part of what you have to build to create a culture that can truly be part of real solutions. The first pillar is a free and inspired life. Our theory is that you have a goal, a relationship with the creator, and you decide what your free and inspired life is.

Carlson (1:22:53): Everybody's unique, and in a decentralized world, everyone is unique. You know, there's no, there’s no formula, so to speak. The second is navigation tools, and that's where people get burned.

Fitts (1:23:09): So, we say in navigation tools, there's an official reality and then there's reality, and you need to know both. Reality is for the management of your time and money, and the official reality is for the cocktail party. And you need to not confuse those. Don't use the official reality to manage your time and money, because then you're going to get, I mean, I clean so many people up from financial fraud and health care fraud because they believe the official reality.

Carlson (1:23:33): So you can't do that. The third is risk management because, in this kind of dangerous environment, everything is about keeping your risk down. And that's more important than making money. It's more important to lower risk than to make money. So, in a well-governed world, we'd all be focused on the outside.

Fitts (1:23:54): But now, we're just focused on preventing loss. The fourth is living equity, which includes all living things—people, family, culture, education—you know, all the things that go into that.

Carlson (1:24:10): And then, financial equity—all the things you know. And then, the last one is, to me, the most important. It's called Turtle Forth. So, did you get the Turtle Forth hat? I did, yeah. OK. Turtle Forth is about never quitting. You must never, ever quit.

Fitts (1:24:27): And the whole goal of the people who are trying to centralize is to make you think it's hopeless. And John Rapoport used to always say that hopelessness is an op, and it's planet-wide. Well, because I am.

Carlson (1:24:44): I am actually struck. Well, by everything that you've said, I think this could be a nine-hour conversation if we let it. But I have one more story. I am also struck by your tone—I don't think I've ever heard someone describe dark deeds with more cheerfulness.

Fitts (1:25:02): Like, how do you, how do you not go crazy? So you have to keep a state of amusement. I mean, it’s, I really, you know, I—I think one of the most breakthrough moments for me in the last 20 years was when I realized that it was okay to be happy no matter what was going on.

Carlson (1:25:21): And sometimes you can't be; it's so horrible what's going on. But I’ll tell you exactly what happened. I had a wonderful church where I studied spiritual warfare for 2½ years at the beginning of the litigation. It was that training that saved my life. I was at a sermon, and there was a co-pastor who had very long fingernails. She was very angry, and she was shaking her hands with her long fingernails.

Fitts (1:25:47): And you know, sometimes when you're in a big church and they point right at you, she said, she said, she said, "The devil can have my house and the devil can have my car, but the devil cannot have my joy." And it was like I exploded in my head, and I said, "That's it."

Carlson (1:26:04): That is it. That is it. Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. You may have noticed that the companies whose products you buy tend to kind of hate you. They're controlled by massive multinational corporations, and they have all kinds of weird agendas that you're supporting when you buy their products. We didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, were in this category.

Fitts (1:26:23): We just want a nicotine pouch. And then they lecture you and take the money you give them to support things you hate. So, we decided to make our own, and we did. And it is, we can say, not bragging here, just stating a fact: the single best nicotine pouch in the world. It's called Out, and it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors—wintergreen, tropical fruit, chilled mint, refreshing chilled sweet nectar, and a bunch of others that we're rolling out.

Carlson (1:26:48): By the way, there are 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors, who will not be named. Zin comes in three, six, and nine milligrams. It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made. Go to alppouch.com. You will not regret it. So, it's a conscious decision not to allow that.

Fitts (1:27:08): To allow that joy to be stolen from you, right? And sometimes it's hard. Did you ever see the movie "The NeverEnding Story"? Read the book. It's a wonderful children's story where the child is the protagonist, and he's fighting a force in the universe called the Nothing.

Carlson (1:27:28): And nothing is running around the universe, sucking meaning out of everything. It's hard when you're dealing with it. If you look at this digital control, it comes with an energy that's very demonic and is sucking meaning out of everything. And they're very good at it.

Fitts (1:27:43): They're masterful at turning, you know, turning allies against each other. The divine and conquer thing is really heartbreaking. It's happening right now on the right heartbreak. And so you're up against nothing. And so sometimes we'll come together in a team meeting, and somebody will say, "I've lost my state of amusement."

Carlson (1:28:04): And then the team's job is to help them get it. I've lost my sense of amusement. I've lost it. My sense of amusement. And it happens. I can't, you know, but I think of this as myself—where? You know, I've had my amusement taken from me a number of times, but I always think to myself, if you're perennially shocked by evil in the world, then you're a child; you're an idiot.

Fitts (1:28:27): Like, what did you think this was, like? Don't be naive. There's a lot of evil in the world. There always has been. Don't be shocked by it. Laugh in its face. You're always going to be shocked by it. Oh, I am—you’re always going to be shocked by it, and I'll tell you why you're going to be shocked by it. If you understand love, you can't fathom why anyone would reject that and embrace.

Carlson (1:28:58): Evil, because. It's so stupid. It's so wasteful. It's so unnecessary, as my mother used to say. You know, it's just like, you just can't fathom why anybody would do it.

Fitts (1:29:15): I watch the folks who are in the financial system, who are deeply corrupt and constantly take, take, and take. You know, the plunder team. And I think, how is that?

Carlson (1:29:32): To me, what they're doing is not fun. I love it; it's not fun. It's not fun when, so I will tell you, I believe my gift is in investing. Everybody has a gift. My gift was in investment banking. I was absolutely fantastic. I was just really, really good at it.

Fitts (1:29:47): And the heartbreak for me was when I had to leave the establishment. I lost the ability, you know—it's like a painter losing the ability to paint. You can't access colors anymore. But I loved it. And when you do it in the right way, 2 + 2 = 20.

Carlson (1:30:05): And it's so exciting. It's the best feeling in the world. It's like, oh, I've lived it. Yeah. So, when Van Co, it's my theory. When Van Co finished a painting, that's what he said—wow, it's like, wow, you know, it's great. And you watch these guys commit fraud and destroy—all the mortgage fraud—and it destroys neighborhoods and families. It's just a lose-lose, lose.

Fitts (1:30:31): And you think that's no fun. No, and they're not happy. I know a number of them, and I had a conversation with Ray Dalio, whom I do like. I don't agree with him on everything, but I do like Ray Dalio, and he has more perspective on life.

Carlson (1:30:47): He had lost a child. I think he was forced to kind of think through what matters. And I asked him off camera recently, like, do you know what? I know a lot of miserable billionaires. I know a couple of happy billionaires, but how many happy billionaires do you know? He's like, I know a few. Like, I'm actually pretty happy, but not that many.

Fitts (1:31:04): And that's a tell, right? That's a tell, and I will tell you. Debt is a symptom. It's not the problem. What's a symptom? The debt. Yeah, the debt. The debt is simple. Yeah, it is. When there was $21 trillion missing as of 2015, when we published that study in 2017, there was $21 trillion of debt.

Carlson (1:31:27): Now, first of all, remember that the Treasury can just issue currency. They don't need debt to create the currency. In fact, I would say that historically, the greatest currencies—or fiat currencies—are not debt-based. Our problem is debt-basing. But let's just grossly oversimplify and talk about what that means with the $21 trillion.

Fitts (1:31:49): So, the Treasury sells pensions, sells Treasury bonds to our pension funds, and moves 21 trillion dollars into the bank accounts at the New York Fed member banks for the Treasury. They're the depository. Then, the 21 trillion dollars disappear out the back door.

Carlson (1:32:07): So, it's just a straw that's sucking our pension fund money into it. I call it the breakaway civilization. Meanwhile, we as taxpayers are now obligated to pay the debt we owe our pension funds, and the money is gone.

Fitts (1:32:25): Why do you call it the breakaway civilization? The term "breakaway civilization" was popularized by Richard Dolan, and it simply describes a decision to create a parallel system. It started with the black budget, but it grew—call it the national security state—building a civilization that is literally separate and not subject to the laws of the existing one.

Carlson (1:32:51): So, if I'm running a company and I want to introduce new systems, I'll implement the new systems while still running the old ones, running them in parallel, and gradually moving things over. Then, at some point, I bring the current system down. To me, that's what the financial coup was.

Fitts (1:33:06): You're moving the money out of one system and putting it into another. So, in theory, 21 trillion dollars is enough at a 5% interest rate to basically finance a private government, if you will.

Carlson (1:33:23): I'm not saying that's what happened, but in theory, do you think it did? So, when I was at HUD in 1989—late 1989 or early 1990—I was in a meeting with the Secretary, and we had brought all the regional administrators in for a meeting with the Secretary.

Fitts (1:33:45): He was very upset because the regional administrator from California had implemented something in response to a court decision. There was a court case in the Court of Appeals, and they decided, "OK, you need to go to the right." So, he had implemented that.

Carlson (1:34:01): And the secretary was having a literal manic episode, screaming in a huge temper tantrum at him. Finally, this guy said, "But, Mr. Secretary, it's the law." He just exploded with fury and shouted, "The law! The law!"

Fitts (1:34:21): I don't have to obey the law. I report to a higher moral authority. And just at that moment, it was like remembering the scene and widening your eyes in a shout when you first walk in on, you know, the secret society doing their occult ritual.

Carlson (1:34:37): You know, you had this image of, oh, you know, he literally doesn't have to obey the laws of the United States. He's operating under a different governance structure. People feel that way, right? And there are many.

Fitts (1:34:54): There's a very famous story about Lincoln when he's talking about what he wants to do to implement the Reconstruction policies. He tells the story of a young child saying, "You know, if I throw the fish back, Dad'll get mad at me."

Carlson (1:35:12): But if I, if I, if it slips from my hand accidentally and you grab it, then Dad won't be mad at me. And the implication of the story is that Lincoln has a dad that he can't buck.

Fitts (1:35:30): And, you know, we're back to the question: who's dad? It's the same question as who's Mr. Global. And you've never gotten closer to the answer, or you've never settled on an answer. Here's my guess. So we did.

Carlson (1:35:45): I once did a two-hour interview on the Solari Report about who Mr. Global is, where we discussed all the different theories. I believe that there are intergenerational pools of capital that meet and work by consensus. It’s a committee system, and they do have a set of rules.

Fitts (1:36:03): And what I don't understand is that their challenge is that they are risk managers, and they are constantly pulling out a lot of money, always needing to get that dividend. The question is, why do they need the dividend? Where is the money going?

Carlson (1:36:19): Because they're constantly running the financial system to extract extra money. There's always disappearing money. And the question is: why, and where is it going? And you think it's going to infrastructure projects? I think it's going to infrastructure projects.

Fitts (1:36:34): I think it's going to require big investments, like building the control grid, which is a major one. And one of my questions about the financial coup is whether they are literally setting up an endowment so they can run the world—creating a global governance that resembles a dictatorship with an endowment.

Carlson (1:36:53): So, it's, you know, it's a bigger endowment than anybody else's. You said a couple of minutes ago that the debt—our US government's debt—which I think even people who aren't interested in the subject are aware of and that it's there and that it's a problem is not the problem; it's a symptom.

Fitts (1:37:13): What did you mean? If you look at our current model, it is not being run on an economic basis, and it's getting much worse—steadily worse. So, let me give you an example: our military budget this year is approximately 850 billion, and the President wants to increase it, or the Secretary of Defense is saying we’ve got to take it to a trillion.

Carlson (1:37:40): Our HHS budget is 1.8 trillion. Doctor Skidmore just did an analysis. If we go back to 2010 levels of disability, we would reduce that by half a trillion dollars—half a trillion, half a trillion.

Fitts (1:37:57): So, America is—what I call—the great poisoning. We've poisoned ourselves, and it's blowing the budget. And it's not just the federal government’s budget; if you look at family budgets, it's also affecting theirs. You know, poisoned people are not productive, and their healthcare costs can be very expensive.

Carlson (1:38:15): And you see that at the federal level, the state level, the local level, and the family level. That's got to be dealt with. But you know, if you look at the budget right now, its expenses are skyrocketing, and it's skyrocketing because the fundamental model of what we do and how we do it is too centralized, but it's not economical.

Fitts (1:38:38): And so, you need to change that. Now, what we do and how we do it. Do you mean how we live? Right, so now I get to tell you my last story. Okay, I can't wait. Okay, this is called the Red Button story. If you look up my name on the Internet, you'll find a copy of the story because it happened to me.

Carlson (1:39:00): In 2000, I was asked by a healthcare practitioner to give a presentation called "How the Money Works" on organized crime, and it later became a very famous article called "Narco Dollars for Beginners." It was meant to be a light, funny description of the intersection of organized crime flows with Washington and Wall Street.

Fitts (1:39:24): So, my book—an online book called *Dylan Reed and the Aristocracy of Stock Profits*—is a case study designed to teach people. It's modeled like a business school case study that shows the intersection between illegal cash flows, Wall Street, and Washington.

Carlson (1:39:42): Anyway, I was in the middle of my speech, describing the congressional testimony on the Dark Alliance allegations that happened in 1998. At the time, I was helping a reporter do research, and she was covering the hearings when a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told her.

Fitts (1:40:04): So, I'm in the middle of my speech, and there are about 100 people at the conference where I'm speaking. It's a conference that happens once a year, organized by this group, and the focus is on how we can evolve our society spiritually. This is a very spiritually committed group of people who want to help our society evolve on a spiritual level.

Carlson (1:40:24): OK, so I'm describing the fact that a spokesperson for the Department of Justice told this reporter that I was helping to reveal that the U.S. economy launders between 500 billion and a trillion dollars a year of all illegal money. So that's narcotics trafficking, that's financial fraud.

Fitts (1:40:41): That's, you know, everything. It's human trafficking. And the number is now much, much bigger. But they were describing the fact that the US economy and financial system are the leaders globally in laundering dirty money. So, I said to this wonderful group of spiritually evolved people, what would happen if we stopped being the global leader in money laundering?

Carlson (1:41:07): And we had a little conversation. They said, well, you know, the money would leave the New York Stock Exchange and go to Singapore, Zurich, or London, and we might have trouble financing the government deficit because, you know, now we borrow over half of the money currently.

Fitts (1:41:25): And so, we know our taxes might go up or our government checks might stop. So I said, OK, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern. If you push that button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your town, your county, your state tomorrow—thus offending the people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of dirty money and accumulated capital.

Carlson (1:41:52): Who here will push the button? And out of 100 people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess how many would push the button? I don't know, one. The other 99 would not push the button, so I wouldn't keep all those kids from dying. Yeah, it would be so… wait.

Fitts (1:42:08): So, I said to them, "Why would you not push the button?" We had a little conversation. They said, "We don't want our taxes to go up, we don't want our government checks to stop, and we don't want our 401(k)s and IRAs to go down." So, if I had voted, there would have been two people pushing the red button.

Carlson (1:42:27): So, what I discovered that day was that the problem wasn't that they wouldn't push the red button, but that they wouldn't go into the invention room and have an honest conversation about what the real problem was. And how I call it—how we turn the red button green, how we make money by pushing the red button.

Fitts (1:42:45): Because then we can push the red button. And you have to push the red button because you cannot become wealthy by liquidating your children. You cannot become wealthy by poisoning your children and your people. And yet, that's what we've been doing in America for decades now.

Carlson (1:43:03): And now, here's the political problem: If you're the new President of the United States and you walk into the Oval Office, your political advisor is going to say to you, "Mr. President, the American people just spent billions getting you elected as president."

Fitts (1:43:20): And now they want payback. They want their government contract. They want their privatization; they want the COLA increase on Social Security. They want a community block development grant. And you're going to turn to your secretary of charging. He says, "Well, you better be nice to the people who could drive 500 billion to a trillion dollars in accumulated capital."

Carlson (1:43:38): And, of course, the number's much bigger now. Now, how are you going to press the red button? You can't. And, if you look at the history of politics in America, the history is that everybody wants their check, and they want the story of "I am good" — I'm a good Christian.

Fitts (1:43:53): I'm not doing any of this corrupt organized crime stuff. You know, I'm just voting. So, I say it this way: When Goldwater, at the end of World War II, George Kennan said we have 6% of the people and 50% of the resources, and we're going to have to be tough if we keep this going.

Carlson (1:44:12): So, Goldwater ran for president. He said, "We're going to have to drop a lot of bombs." And the American people said, "Oh, no, we don't want to do that. We're good Christians." So, Jimmy Carter came along, and he shivered in front of the fireplace, and Americans said, "Oh, no, we don't want to do that."

Fitts (1:44:27): We don't want to cut back. And so, the Bushes came along and said, "You know something? You all are good Christians. Here's your check. Don't ask questions." And that's where we've been. Everybody wants the story of "I am good." The problem is, you can push the red button, you can turn it green, but it has to be done one neighborhood at a time.

Carlson (1:44:48): You need to allocate all the money properly, and instead of spending government funds to centralize control and on the control grid, you need to re-engineer it to build real wealth. Additionally, you must decentralize economic power. If you centralize, you create many billionaires, but you'll end up shrinking the overall pie.

Fitts (1:45:07): And that's what we've been doing. And we've been making money from poisoning each other. If people want to learn more about you, your research, and your views on things, if they want to know about the 11 years you spent fighting the feds for blowing the whistle on them, where do they go?

Carlson (1:45:26): Where do they get that information? So, we published the Solari Report. It's solari.com, SOLARI.com, and we have a subscription service. We also offer a lot of free content, so if you want to get to know us, you can explore the free materials and learn a tremendous amount.

Fitts (1:45:42): We'd love to have you as a subscriber, and we have a great group of subscribers. What happened to me was that I fell into this because I had terrible experiences with the corporate media. So, I started doing shows, giving out my email, and inviting people to ask questions.

Carlson (1:46:04): And over many years, the questions would come in, and we'd publish the answers. It would go on and on, and it went on for free for a long time. Then, finally, I received so many questions that I decided I needed to hire people. We have this global network of subscribers and an audience who get on the site and share comments. They're brilliant.

Fitts (1:46:25): And we help each other figure things out. We've literally become an intelligence network, you know, and it's all people who want to be free. They all understand that one can't be free unless we're all free. This is an all-or-nothing thing. They either get the control grid or we're free.

Carlson (1:46:43): And the only way we're going to be free is if everybody's free. It's an all-or-nothing deal. And there are a lot of people now who understand this and are gathering, and, you know, so I have many subscribers. I don't—I just know from what they say. I have many subscribers. Who are your subscribers?

Fitts (1:46:59): Because they feel, and I feel, you're on the same journey. Yeah. I'm just not a very systematic thinker. So, a lot of my instincts tell me that you're telling the truth. And of course, I agree completely with your orientation. I just, my brain doesn't work that way. So, it's been a true pleasure to hear all of this.

Carlson (1:47:17): Thank you. Well, thank you. I love your work, so thank you. I've been a subscriber from the very beginning. Underground bases—you’re following my mind. Catherine Austin Fitts, thank you very much.
