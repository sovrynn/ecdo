## Review

I wanted to offer you David Dobbs really excellent late model (ever so convincing based upon historical, sociological, ancient artwork and text which he presented in his most humble well developed manner on 12/28(?) or perhaps 12/30/23z

But distressfully/- now that I sought ot out— it was REMOVED by effing Utube.

It was a MOST EXCELLENT piece.. not telling the viewer what to see.. rather offering data points and perspectives of broad value.  The ancient art— in various ages. Prehistoric to present, and inclusive of middle aged times. (YOU  DO REALIZE HISTORY IS SO DISTORTED, 

But what really made great sense to me from an astronomical perspective  was the model. (His new model!)
Which depicts two axial projections of stars, each as expected with planetary solar systems. 

AS IF there was some central explosion from a “galactic center”..  then mass would be hurled out into the VOID. Gravity would harness other nearby mass and become entertained.. and objects and hence systems become entertained and revolve around each other. Some stars, or later collapsed would revolve at varying degrees, with different velocities, and yet be projected in like paths.

Niburu SiStar (collapsed brown dwarf) acid is just a bit off Solaris axis projection.  Some planets, gas Giants interact from es h system (hence what are called “EXO planets” interact with both in this binary star system of our mother Solaris SUN. Jupiter and Saturn, according to this latest model orbits encompass both axial systems in this model.

This made complete sense to me.!  
The fact  the video is no longer accessible speaks a multitude of truths. Why the suppression? I pray for his safety.

Are you talking about this one?
