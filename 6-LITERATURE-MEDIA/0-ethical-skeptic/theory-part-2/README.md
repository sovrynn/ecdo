# Theory Part 2: Flooding of the Khafre Pyramid

[Here](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2023/12/18/hidden-in-plain-sight/) is the original thesis.

## Comment Quotes

I suspect that the ocean levels are far higher than they were back before this Khafre-marked inundation. We lost a LOT of civilization either interred under the mud-flow from the deluge or buried under the sea with the residual higher sea level. If Gobekli Tepe existed out of the box 10,400 bce, then I suspect a lot more civilization did as well at that same time. Its proximity ‘Eden’ (the garden plain just below it) however, might suggest a boundary in time (???).

Yes, this 575 feet seems excessive for a regional flood. Have not resolved that yet – other than to note that the Arabian Peninsula is its own tectonic plate, subject to rising and falling, based upon large scale mantle movements.

## Summary

This thesis is undoubtedly fascinating. It uses one of the Egyptian pyramids, to infer that Earth has had massive floods, and additionally, that the Pyramid was built as a marker for an important planetary state(s).

The thesis starts out by disproving the existing Khufu Khafre history as false wrt when the pyramids were built. He uses carbon dating of nearby historical ancient mortars, which came from long before the supposed pyramid creation date. He also exposes fake quarry marks, tomb robber wood plank dating, defiled/repurposed Sphinx statue, and deducing the existence of ancient block raising technology to do so.

Next, he uses physical evidence of the erosion pattern of the supposed Khafre pyramid to propose that the only way this erosion pattern would have happened is through seawater erosion. The vertical range of the waves, the limestone dissolving in seawater, the corner erosion pattern of the cap, limestone inside the pyramid, and salt inside the pyramid to do so. Additionally he shows receding shoreline markings in the Arabian peninsula to support this claim.

Finally he ends by using various ancient myths and stories to infer that such floodings may have multiple times throughout history.
