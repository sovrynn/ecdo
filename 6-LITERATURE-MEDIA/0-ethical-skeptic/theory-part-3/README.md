It is our contention that we are now well past an Indigo Point of exothermic core-mantle decoupling, and that we have incorrectly interpreted the heat presented by this transpiration as being caused by man’s activity alone. We now face the urgent need to detect the approach of a subsequent Tau Point Dzhanibekov oscillation in Earth’s rotation. During such an event, the outer rotational body (ORB) of the Earth, comprising the mantle and crust, decouples from the core at the H-layer. This decoupling is central to the mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation hypothesis discussed in this paper.

Point Indigo (Construct and critical path):
- Weakening of the core-mantle magnetic coupling (Earth’s geomagnetic moment) and North Pole (Np) priority.
- Contribution of exothermic kinetic energy (heat) into the Earth’s mantle (see Exhibit E2), excluding the axially-located Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVP – see Exhibit E) – which become relatively lower in density as compared to the surrounding core-fed mantle.
- Causing dramatic ocean SST and northern hemisphere tundra warming, along with a resulting forced carbon dioxide and methane release.

Point Tau (Prediction):
- Once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the core-mantle magnetic coupling gives way to a gyroscopically mediated form of Dzhanibekov rotation from Np to Np‘ (104º along 31º E longitude – the same meridian as the Khufu Pyramid). The H-layer of the core accelerates its exothermic sloughing, and this material-shedding effect serves as a kind of ‘infinite lubricant’ between the core and the mantle, allowing the two bodies to rotate independently.

The reader should note that, while the longitude of point 4 (green ball) on the chart shown in Exhibit G above is arguably the 31st East Meridian, the same one upon which Giza is located, there exists a range of latitude inside which a center of LLVP lower density might be assigned. The north-south placement could range from 8 to 18 degrees south latitude. We chose 104° (103.5° +⁄− 1° or 13.5° South Latitude) for consistency in the specific scenario of conjecture here. As well, this angle corresponds to 90 degrees of cardinal rotation through Dzhanibekov effect, combined with a very reasonable and common 14 degrees of gross (not longitude dependent) magnetic pole variation (angle between core magnetic and rotational poles – under the same definition convention used in celestial navigation).

Gyroscopically Mediated Dzhanibekov Rotation – not a retrograde rotation. What we postulate is a modified pure Dzhanibekov Effect rotation (Exhibit C), which does not complete fully – being mediated by the gyroscopic effect of the differential mass planes between the LLVP less dense axis versus the more dense surrounding mantle. This more dense body serves as a form of gyroscopic wheel, forcing the Earths rotation to conserve momentum by taking on a gyroscopic stability priority, and neither a core-mantle coupled nor pure Dzhanibekov rotation.

We speculate that the process of moving from State 2, Gyroscopic Priority, back to State 1, Geomagnetic Priority, may involve a viscoelastic-mantle tectonic height readjustment and gradual settle-in process [based on Saudi Arabia slowly receding coastline evidence], however involving a relatively sudden cooling event at the point where the core recaptures its HCP-Fe lattice integrity.

The Arabian Desert may well have occurred as the result of a settle-in process unique to the Arabian Tectonic Plate after or during return to State 1. Hence the seemingly more recent receding shorelines back to the Persian Gulf.

There is a 104-degree span between the shafts extending from both the King’s and Queen’s Chambers in the Khufu Pyramid. This is not accidental. Neither are these shafts purposed for air supply or spotting specific stars. It is our conjecture that the three chambers of the Khufu Pyramid were designed to house sophisticated sensors used to monitor the Earth’s rotational stability.
1. King’s Chamber – Celestial Pole Nutation Monitoring
2. Queen’s Chamber – Geomagnetic Moment and Ionospheric Monitoring
3. Subterranean Chamber – H-Layer P-Wave Infrasound Monitoring

Finally, pertaining to the comparative credibility of the Torah/Bible narrative, as a lifelong sailor of sometimes heavy seas, I recognize that a long and narrow keelboat design, also known as a ‘surface-piercing/large freeboard’ class of ocean vessel, especially one not under power, would not have survived the kinetic inundation described. The popular depictions of Noah’s Ark, purported by the Bible to be a 450 x 75 x 45 ft vessel of this class (aspect ratio of 6:1 – see top two panels of Exhibit P to the right), would not have withstood the bow-on sea-state-induced moment called ‘hogging,’ and its segmented 450 ft keel would have snapped very quickly.

This observation, as much as anything, suggests to me that the Torah/Bible story was a later fabrication. This was not a fanciful, symbolic, allegorical, nor inspirational story to demonstrate God’s providence and mercy. It was a lie—and all other more accurate versions of the account were obliterated or buried. The question is, why? The reader should take note that such obfuscation becomes a consistent pattern in regard to human history and origins.

## Comment Quotes

I think you raise a sound point. It is possible that some or even most of our continental drift occurs quickly as a facet of ECDO events. The gradualism approach is the result of a flawed assumption now taken as proven, when it is not.

In my hypothesis, it predicts that after the flip – the world is a volcanically dark, very cold, and wet place for a significant period of time. Perhaps this initiates an ice age. But that has all yet to be confirmed – but it part of the process of science. No one person proves out a hypothesis all by them self. This is how they control our thought, by simply refusing to participate in the process.

We don’t know the plastic dynamics of the mantle, asthenosphere, and lithosphere, except to note that they are all indeed plastic at 932 to 4000 degrees C. They would deform immediately. during the days of the shift. Probably not a pleasant thing, even if one was up above the flood-wash.

> Fascinating paper. However, why would the ocean settle on the Giza plateau (and presumably other currently elevated areas) for up to 50 years rather than drain back into its former position within a few days or weeks of ‘the deluge’? Or is the suggestion that it did and the observed erosion happened in that very short timeframe? Or perhaps the melting of the ice caps, now at warmer latitudes, results in an overall increase in global sea level of several hundred feet but then there should be plenty of evidence of the new shorelines at this higher elevation if they existed only recently (c.12k years ago)….

The difference between ocean heights globally is about 680 ft, as compared to a perfect sphere. When the Earth changes orientation, the oceans take on a different set of positions and ‘bulges’ if you will, still in that 680 fit differential from lowest to highest. So dry land appears where ocean once was, and some land gets submerged, until the Earth rights itself back into position 10 to 50 years later. Then, what you cite, happens (albeit not exactly the same as it once was).

Magnetism decreases by the square of the distance between the objects. So, anything which would influence the rotational body of the Earth has to be REALLY close by. The only thing really close by, is the core. The oceans do not have enough mass to cause the Earth to flip. Only the mesosphere (mantle) carries this mass sufficiency. Therefore, we have to start by looking there – at its imbalances and magnetic qualities. Nothing else is stronger.

## Summary

Of course, the killer thesis. It makes a jump in logic, which may or may not be true until it can be verified. But the flooding of the Khafre pyramid, creates a necessity, for some kind of mechanism, which could have brought this about in the past, may again, and may be linked to the reality of core heating.

The assumptions/priors are:
1. Weakening of Earth's magnetic moment
2. Heating of the Earth's mantle from the core
3. Resulting in heating of the ocean and carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere

Leading to the big hypothesis - once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the mantle gyroscopically rotates, through a phenomenon like the Dzhanibekov rotation.

The center of the LLVM structure structures is perpendicular to the centers of the ocean heating. This is seen as not coincidental.

The point that rotates to the North Pole is the lighter LLVM, which is in South Africa's cusp. The angle between the axis of this point through the center of the Earth is 104 degrees from the North Pole. The South Pole would then become a point in the Pacific.

The points on the Earth which stay fixed wrt the relative rotation of the Earth around its axis, are the points perpendicular to the two LLVM lightweight centroids, which are the centers of the heating of the Earth's surface from the mantle. These are in north South America and Indonesia.

Finally, to tie it all together, the author points to the Pyramid of Khafre and the angle of its two shafts. This pyramid lies on the same longitude line as the lighter LLVM centroid in South Africa. The angle between the two shafts is 104 degrees, which means it may have been intentionally constructed as a measurement tool for this Dzhanibekov rotation of the Earth. The shafts, in turn, point towards the North Pole in the state of Earth before and after the pole flip.
