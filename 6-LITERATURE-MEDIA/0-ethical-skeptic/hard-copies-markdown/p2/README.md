# Hidden in Plain Sight

*Posted on December 18, 2023 by The Ethical Skeptic*

The following material presents one of three novel hypotheses, each developed by the author through decades of dedicated professional and independent research. These original hypotheses form the foundation of The Ethical Skeptic’s ECDO Theory, which is summarized in this article.

*The unique features we document in this article point compellingly to a sustained, specific oceanic displacement, driven by Earth’s rotational mechanics, as the most plausible explanation. This is not the result of a 371-day biblical deluge, a tidal wave, a cosmic collision, or any external gravitational force affecting our solar system.*

*If I find a dead body in the living room immediately after a party, it doesn’t matter how many expert attendees testify that the party went fine; the dead body proves otherwise. Khafre’s erosion marks constitute ‘dead body’ falsification level evidence.*

*Be advised, discerning readers: upon fully engaging with the contents of this article, your perspective on both the Giza Pyramids and our planet may never be the same again.*

“A groundbreaking and fresh perspective on the construction and history of the Khafre Pyramid, this article introduces novel and paradigm-shattering hypotheses. The contention that the differential erosion patterns on Khafre were caused by an ancient and sustained oceanic displacement, along with the innovative theory of the Sabu Disk being used in conjunction with the Sekhem-mu Machine in the pyramid’s construction, are particularly striking. These ideas challenge conventional understandings and open new avenues for exploration in the otherwise authority-privileged field of Egyptology.”

I operate under a dilemma, I must admit. On the one hand, history and archaeology have collectively produced a compelling argument that Pharaohs Khufu and Khafre commissioned construction of the two largest of the Pyramids of Giza, during Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (2580 through 2540 BCE). On the other hand, nature quietly testifies to a much richer and deeper history wound up inside the legacy of these two edifices. As is often the case in such circumstances, the true casualty of our dissonance is the evidence which resides right before our very eyes.

I have learned, through this lifelong journey of ethical skepticism, that evidence brought from the testimony of agency, especially that which is merely suggestive in nature, as opposed to definitive, should always be held in neutral question (epoché).[1] Moreover, when the experts (agents) who bring the evidence rely upon inference projected outside of their actual domains of expertise, and are backed by the awesome insistence of sycophants who fail to comprehend the irony of enforcing such doctrines through skepticism. This is a lesson mankind learned the hard way, during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

If you regard those who bear discomfort with the Khufu/Khafre orthodoxy, as promoting the red herring notions that aliens built these two particular pyramids or one is racist against modern Arabs or Old Kingdom Egyptians, then perhaps you should stop reading this article here. I would suggest you go back to the comfort of your latest issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, as this article is guaranteed to stir dissonance-fueled indignance in your hard shell of a heart.

Yes, I have personally toured the Giza Plateau and other famous monuments of Ancient Egypt during my days working for an Egyptian client. I have spent extensive time examining the stones and craftsmanship involved in the Khufu and Khafre pyramids, both as a tourist and as well as an expert in the construction of large structures and development of advanced durable and hard materials. So I am qualified to examine the evidence regarding these structures, unlike a historian or archaeologist.

Accordingly, during my years of experience, I have formulated several hard-earned truths, among which include this:

*The person most likely to lie, is the appeal-to-authority proponent of the Narrative. Such an agent operates upon the premise that, since the Narrative is true, one small harmless hyperbolic misrepresentation is acceptable, nay even necessary, when crafted in support of convincing others of that truth. A problem arises when the official Narrative consists of an entire stack of such small Lindy effect fabrications. A monument constructed of 20% induction and 80% awesome insistence.*

### The Orthodoxy Problem

Few better examples of this can be found than that of the testimony of the priests of Amun-Ra, to Greek historian Herodotus, in An Account of Egypt (450 BCE).[2] In the account delivered by those priests to Herodotus, the Great Pyramid was built by Pharaoh Khufu, who, in his malevolence, dictated an end to the temple sacrifices, shut up the temples (of Ptah at that time), and thereby diverted the monetary tithes to his project. According to this account, he constructed the edifice over 30 years (ten to construct the causeway and twenty to build the pyramid itself) with 100,000 men, partially funding the project by placing his daughter into prostitution (the ‘stews’).

![](img/2.webp)

In this account, made Lindy by the Priests of the Osiris/Isis/Horus holy trinity, one can detect an assembly of the fanciful, self-financially justifying, and ridiculous—elements most likely accreted by the priests themselves over the ensuing two thousand years after Khufu’s Fourth Dynasty. The Gods will forgive those who lie on their behalf, because when a God, science, or truth reigns supreme, that fact is more important than verity itself (see Omega Hypothesis). Such is the nature of agency and the ‘priests’ therein.

Now, to the merit of the orthodox position on this issue of contention, various studies have been conducted which support a Fourth Dynasty pharaonic origin of the Khufu pyramid itself. What he referred to as ‘quarry marks’ were noted in Wellington’s (2nd), Nelson’s (3rd), Lady Arbuthnot’s (4th), and Campbell’s (5th) Chambers by British Colonel and antiquarian, Richard W. Howard Vyse, in 1837 upon his first entry into those ‘relieving chambers.’ These forms of red paint graffiti contained variations of the pharaoh’s name, Khufu, Khnum-Khuf and Medjedu.[3] At first blush, this constitutes pretty darned good evidence in support of what has been promoted as the archaeological Narrative on the matter.

### The Kiln-Fired Mortar Falsification

However, various carbon-14 dating efforts were conducted in 1984 and 1995 on samples of kiln-fired mortar (bound charcoal and charcoal VOCs) taken from service bakeries and structures nearby the Khufu pyramid. As a group, these were dated to 1480 years older than the Fourth Dynasty legendary dates of construction.[4] Much of the mortar was contemporary with the Dixon Relic cedar plank carbon-14 dating and presented a significant problem for the Fourth Dynasty Narrative. These Egyptians were not using 15 to 1500 year old wood to fire their kilns—this is guaranteed. To date, there has not been a single published carbon-14 dating of mortar from inside the Khufu pyramid, much less from inaccessible areas. What little study has been completed, outlined below, was forced by alternative researchers and would never have been undertaken by academic archaeology.

![](img/3.webp)

1984 Bowman Study: This initial study included a smaller set of samples, which yielded dates ranging from approximately 2853 to 2800 BCE. These dates were older than the conventional dates for the Fourth Dynasty, which is typically placed around 2575–2465 BCE.[5]

1995 Lehner Study: This larger and more comprehensive study included 64 samples, with dates ranging from approximately 4000 to 2300 BCE. The wide range reflects the variability in the materials and the complex history of construction and use of the site.[6]

But this does not stop dishonest Narrative apologists from using hocus-pocus adjustments to recalibrate the carbon-14 results for only the 46 Fourth Dynasty samples[7] along with semantic sleight-of-hand to imply that kiln-fired mortar charcoal samples were extracted from the Great Pyramid itself—when none were actually taken from it at all.[8] Even if samples had been taken from Khufu, the Narrative remains falsified, while alternative evidence remains not only plausible, but probable.

### The Quarry Marks Autoaufheben

This being said, we have yet to find other unquestionably Fourth Dynasty Egyptian quarry marks any other place in the pyramid, and have yet to date substantial material extracted from the pyramid itself – including most definitively, the organic vehicle and binder (iron oxide does not bind by itself) of the red ochre paint from the quarry marks in the relieving chambers. Why has this relatively easy and essential task of the scientific method not been attempted?[9] Red ochre use itself of course is not an indicator of relative modernity, as red ochre markings have been found at various archaeological sites associated with early homo sapiens, dating back as far as 100,000 years ago—at caves in Lascaux, France, and Altamira, Spain for instance.

![](img/4.webp)

**Exhibit A1** – Howard Vyse’s ‘quarry marks’ found in Lady Arbuthnot’s (4th) relieving chamber (click to expand). Whoever did this went a bit ‘over the top’. Note: upside down markings, placed to avoid in situ stones post construction = a lie (logical autoaufheben).

The Khufu relieving chamber quarry marks themselves are made of the same ochre formulation, and are remarkably framed and optimally placed for viewing inside each of the relieving chambers – an amazing feat of prescience on the part of the quarrymen (see Exhibit A1 for Vyse’s May 10th 1837 diagram of Lady Arbuthnot’s (4th) Chamber). In this feat, they knew exactly where the site foreman would select which stones be placed, and how all (not just some) those same stones would face as a result of that selection, from a streaming supply chain of random stones, and finally exactly how to place the marks so as to avoid separate internal chamber obstacles and chaotic roof-floor stone placements from obscuring those same marks. I found it curious that quarrymen, so proud of their role, trade, and product, so prone to marking up stones for their beloved King, would not use consistent brandings (familiar only to the project workers) to identify the product of each specific crew or purpose/quality of each stone. Furthermore, where are the engineering marks? They are conspicuously absent, from crews apparently endowed with such large quantities of high-quality ochre, that they could waste it through grotesque and pompous markings—as if their first day on the job.

Exhibit A1 – Quarry Mark Forgery Notes:

1. If these long lines and numerous large hieroglyphs were painted in the quarry, why then is there no scuffing, limestone dust infusion, or sun-baked discolorations in any of the ochre paint? The stones were handled with brute force—by hand, strap/line, wood and rock roller, transport cart, and metal lever. They were often flipped, slid across wet sand or stone, stored in the sun, and knocked and scuffed against other stones. These stones were handled at a construction site, not in a museum or university lecture hall. The marks are in too perfect a condition and ended up too skillfully placed around adjacent stones to be ‘quarry marks.’

2. Why did they not employ the more experienced and practical methods of chalk or charcoal marking? And if this entire implied technique was an essential work gang standard method of construction, where are all these marks in the rest of the pyramid? Why were there no Egyptian hieroglyph or hieratic script markings at all in the original granite etchings on the walls of the King and Queen’s Chambers of the Khufu Pyramid?[10]

3. Moreover, a construction engineer does not use alignment-level marks to place stones which are edge-fitted in situ. Such marks are used for fastened and cast components, not chaotic-arrival ad hoc fieldstone placement—as the flatness (Ff) and levelness (Fl) are achieved by dressing (hammering, chiseling, abrading) the stone both during and after its setting in place. Nor would those alignment-level marks, even if used as balancing guides, line up perfectly between stones (as they do in the relieving chambers) once the stone was finish-dressed. Some of these marks were purposefully offset at cracks to imply intra-stone shifting, when the seam immediately below makes it clear that no such shifting had indeed occurred at all.

4. Why were no red ochre glyphs found in Davison’s (1st) Chamber, first opened in 1765 by Nathaniel Davison and the only chamber not first entered by Vyse himself? Yet, suddenly we are beset with an abundance of red ochre glyphs in Wellington’s, Nelson’s, Lady Arbuthnot’s, and Campbell’s chambers, all first opened and occupied for hours by Vyse, who insisted that he be allowed to do so by himself alone?

5. Furthermore, certain glyphs are inscribed in an inverted orientation—a specific claim to quarry marking—but still align with the surrounding stones as they exist in situ. Placing marks purposely upside down while also conforming in situ constitutes an irrefutable and deliberate act of deception (logical autoaufheben, or self-canceling claim set) on Vyse’s part. Each observation might bear standalone validity, but not both taken together.

6. By the same formal fallacy of logic, the limestone wall stones were all fine surface dressed (chiseled, abraded, and sanded) to conform to a smooth wall after they had been set in place. So why would any markings be placed upside down on a post-dressed and finished-in-position wall at all? Again, we are presented with an autoaufheben logical conflict—as if a child fabricated the lies involved, lacking the sophisticated acumen to catch the inconsistency.

7. Finally, these glyphs are painted over the cyanobacteria and actinobacteria black patina, and are painted inside exfoliation and spalling gaps, indicating their placement well after the aging and weathering of the stone and certainly well after the stones were hewn and these chambers were constructed.

These red ochre marks were clearly applied thousands of years after the fact and, more importantly, well after the stones had settled, aged, and weathered. Why has spineless archaeology failed to address these critical issues, which are glaringly obvious to a construction engineer?

Additionally, why did the quarry workers not conservatively sketch small (by practice discipline) quality, engineering, trade, bench, or construction marks? Why are they not made in uneducated hieratic script, by means of several penmanship styles, with low-quality field ochre stashed out in the hot sun? Things that would occur in the real world (and indeed did occur in the Queen’s Chamber air shaft in this mid-shaft engineering mark and also as shown in Exhibit A2 below). For example, this link portrays actual ‘engineering marks‘ verified as being from the time of Khufu (2nd Funerary Boat Chamber). The simple fact is that the builders did not employ any Fourth Dynasty engineering marks, and especially not gigantic hieroglyph and cartouche as construction or quarry marks. We would have easily observed them all over the edifice if this were the case—and we do not.

How conveniently erudite it was, for Old Kingdom stone laborers working in a ‘drunkard’s gang,’ to be educated in perfect elite Egyptian script and to know the names of their ‘beloved’ Pharaoh Khufu from 1200 years of differing cultural periods. Yet, Herodotus cites that Khufu was hated for his initial actions in pyramid-building preparation; and that as a result, neither he, his son, nor grandson were beloved by their work gangs or local population in the least. Khufu and Khafre were vilified to such a degree that the local people “by reason of their hatred of them are not very willing to name [the pyramids after them]; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.”

Or perhaps the locals possessed a differing account of the pyramid’s origin and contended that the Khufu-origin tales of the priests were bunk to begin with. The priests, knowing that Herodotus would eventually catch wind of this, simply crafted an inoffensive but story-friendly spin in advance to support their fable.[11] [12]

*One will find that when orthodox religion and narrative science team up, the offspring of such a union are often the grandest of lies.*

### The Red Ochre Forgery

In addition, Vyse’s red ochre markings do not match the red ochre (non-hieroglyph, non-hieratic) marking ‘shadows’ (residual iron oxide bound inside the limestone matrix where the ochre paint used to exist at one time) found on the other side of the limestone door at the end of the Queen’s Chamber south air shaft by the Djedi Project in 2011. A comparison between what verifiably-aged red ochre shadows on a limestone surface should look like, versus what Vyse found, can be seen by clicking on Exhibit A2 to the right. Vyse’s quarry marks are in far newer (and glossy) condition than are the Djedi Project marks (no paint vehicle or binder remain – and no, these are not 3rd millennium hieratic numerals)—exhibiting none of the requisite chalking of both limestone block and ochre paint itself, as demonstrated by the Djedi Project markings.

![](img/5.webp)

**Exhibit A2 – Vyse’s Forgery** – The relieving chamber ochre marks (bottom image) in no way resemble actual verifiable ochre marks (top image) from the time of construction (click to expand). See notes regarding this in the article text.

Exhibit A2 – Red Ochre Forgery Notes:

1. Both of the photos in Exhibit A2 have been processed by the same gamma, saturation, local tone mapping, brightness, contrast, and hue-color channel settings. Do not fall for tone map, contrast, and saturation blasted images altered to make the Djedi Project markings resemble the ochre markings in the King’s relieving chambers—tricks used to make the top image iron oxide look similar to the bottom image ochre paint. They are not the same.[13]

2. The symbols in the top image consist of iron oxide bound inside the limestone matrix (a shadow), no actual paint (vehicle and binder) remains. While in contrast, the bottom image shows red ochre paint vehicle and binder which have not flaked off in the least.

3. The person laying down the ochre markings in the bottom image had to turn their right hand to avoid the oblique wall stone (bottom right of lower image). Yet they were attempting to make it appear as if the markings extended behind the wall stone. This is deception.

4. The person making the markings in the top image was laying down casual engineering script, under the assumption that it would never be seen again. The person making the markings in the bottom image was laying down markings which were designed to impress and compel, over-the-top images they wanted others to witness—inside a chamber which was supposedly intended to never be entered again.

5. The marks in both the Exhibit A2 lower image and in this linked image were on the ceiling of the fifth chamber, not even on the floor, as is the case with the Djedi Project ochre, and yet little of the ochre in the Vyse ceiling marks had flaked off at all despite the force of gravity. In contrast, all the Djedi Project marking ochre is completely gone. Why did Vyse’s ‘decayed and flaked’ quarry marks not leave an iron oxide shadow bound into the stone matrix, as occurred with the Djedi Project markings? The answer is simple: It has not had sufficient time for this to occur. Moreover, the marks in the text-linked image above appear to be purposeful dabs of an ochre brush placed specifically to tender the appearance of post-flaking paint.

6. Finally, and most importantly, note that the black cyano/actino-bacteria patina in the Air Shaft chamber has covered over the genuine red iron oxide shadow (top image). While in contrast, the orange goethite patina in the relieving chamber is painted over by the red ochre paint forgery (bottom image). This is fatal to the relieving chamber red ochre claims.

The contrasting pristine condition of the Vyse quarry markings is extraordinary, given the 30 to 100-degree temperature swings in the relieving chambers over a purported 4,500 years. Additionally, these marks overlay the limestone patina, which should have formed after the paint was applied if it were truly of Khufu’s Fourth Dynasty in origin. The patina which has formed inside the quarrying cuts, and has been painted over by Vyse as shown in Exhibit A2, is called iron-oxidizing microbial patina, a type of encrustation which bears rust-like orange pigment as the result of the microbial activity.[14]

*The goethite patina inside the limestone block cuts requires a large amount of time in which to form, indicating that the stone cuts had already aged significantly before the red ochre paint was added. Therefore, the quarry marks are not contemporary with the original construction of the pyramid.*

Once I found summaries of the work records indicating that only Vyse entered these chambers first, even going so far as to fire his colleague Giovanni Caviglia for the mere risk that Caviglia might enter one of the newly detected chambers first (Creighton, 2018), and the fact that some of the incorrect markings conveniently ‘disappeared’ in the intervening years (Creighton, 2024, sections VI. B. and C.3.), and some appeared after the original documentation by multiple researchers (Creighton, 2024; sections VI. A. and C.1.), my hackles were unexpectedly raised.[15] [16]

*Contrary to the Colonel’s published account, his private account presents no clear and obvious ‘moment of discovery’ of quarry marks in any of the chambers, with the exception of Wellington’s where some genuine marks were found on its eastern wall but of which, as we have seen, the Colonel states were “nothing like hieroglyphics”.*

~ Creighton, “Analysis of the Painted ‘Quarry Marks'”, 2024.

In the end, it became abundantly clear from the depictions in Vyse’s and others’ work, that the ‘quarry marks’ were not affixed in the quarry at all. Instead, they were made by one person: an acclaim-motivated Egyptologist, from the modern era, over-sharing his sophomoric knowledge of engineering/construction, fully unaware of the accountability to be soon brought by photography, mass spectrometry, and radiocarbon dating science; by a right-handed person who had to turn the ochre brush because his hand was restricted by nearby perpendicular and oblique stones (see Exhibit A2), by that one person laying on their side on the floor stones and having to avoid the roof stone, and in a setting post-construction, attempting to make it appear as if the marks were painted pre-construction. The person conducting the forgery ‘lathered on’ the ochre by means of a single high quality, plentiful, and sealed jar of red ochre, decades of practice at hieroglyph drawing, a single penmanship style employing grotesquely oversized and ochre-inefficient symbols – with far too much knowledge of both this formal written script and esoteric pharaonic traditions as they were understood in the Nineteenth Century CE.

The person who made these marks was a liar, and not a very skilled one at that. He lacked the ethics to complete or justify the science he had begun—perhaps the very reason he was dubbed to perform this ‘investigation’ in the first place. From first hand knowledge, intelligence agencies prefer obedient soldiers like Vyse, sufficiently smart but otherwise unethical and obtuse actors willing to do their bidding.

*Individually and collectively, these observations are fatal to the extraordinary claim of Fourth Dynastic origin. Furthermore, until we carbon-14 date the organic vehicle and binder in Vyse’s ‘discovered’ hieroglyph red ochre, Egyptology should be considered a pseudoscience.*

Before I actually saw Vyse’s journal entries, I considered his discoveries to constitute irrefutable evidence. I was misled by abductive and circular (petitio principii) arguments such as those posed by Matt Sibson in this Ancient Architects video on YouTube—to artificially enforce the Khufu burial chamber Narrative without any scientific evidence whatsoever. Unfortunately, what such Narrative pushers do is subtly attack dissent through pseudo-objective, shallow, and at best, inductive inference, serving as gristmills of distraction. Motivated by envy over the attention dissenting voices earn, they shroud their propaganda pieces in sensationalist headlines such as “Cracking the Göbekli Tepe Code,” “Secret to How the Pyramids Were Built Finally Revealed,” or “A True Mystery of the Great Pyramid Discovered.” Such push-marketed and red herring articles then consist of polemic enforcing the same exact answers archaeology pre-concluded in 1837.

After watching a handful of these propaganda pieces you’d think that Dr. Robert Schoch and Graham Hancock were in the bunker with Eva and Adolf. As a result, dissenting voices are unfairly denied access to public archaeological sites that are neither the property nor under the ontological custody of these propaganda clowns begin with. Mere administrators and video makers quietly regarding themselves to be Gods. This breed of dishonest professional/student and abuse of authority is slowly undermining the credibility of archaeology, such that the public no longer buys the ad hoc appeal to virtue, “Why would archaeologists want to lie?”

### The Cedar Plank, Sphinx Erosion, and Thermolumenescence Coups de Grâce

Finally and most importantly, cedar wood pieces (see Exhibit A3) dropped by ancient tomb raiders—not sealed from the original construction—within the north air shaft of the Queen’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Khufu, exist as part of three Dixon Relics, along with a grabbing hook and a depth-measuring sounding ball.[17] In 1872, Waynman Dixon and his colleague Dr. James Grant chiseled their way into the sealed Queen’s Chamber shafts They inserted a rod into the northern shaft that managed to loosen three objects among rubble in the shaft: a bronze grappling hook, a granite ball, and a short rod described as ‘cedar-like’ by Dixon.[18] Carbon dating conducted on these pieces in 1995, and finally confirmed in 2020, places the wood 650-900 years (3341-3094 BCE) before the Fourth Dynasty of Pharaoh Khufu.[19] The pieces of wood lay at the bottom of the sloping section of the shaft, indicating they were dropped from a higher access point, along with a considerable amount of rubble resulting from a previously undetected side penetration into the northern shaft. This intrusion occurred well before the time of Khufu’s Fourth Dynasty, from an unknown chamber access made by ‘tomb robbers’ of that time.[20] In any other discipline aside from archaeology, this would have been an Ockham’s Razor moment—absolutely fatal to the prevailing Narrative. Yet, this significant find is often purposely overlooked or ill-framed in favor of maintaining the established story.[21]

![](img/6.webp)

**Exhibit A3 – Queen’s Chamber North Air Shaft Tomb Raider Wood Fragments** – date to almost a millennium before the Fourth Dynasty of Khufu.

*The Great Pyramid’s ‘tomb’ was already being robbed almost a millennium before it could have even served as Khufu’s tomb in the first place. This is fatal to the prevailing hypothesis.*

In this same manner, to a trained professional eye, the unique type of erosion we discuss later in this article indicates that the Khafre depiction on the Sphinx is a re-purposing of a far older monument (see Exhibit A4 to the right). The erosion on the back of the head matches the karst erosion on the casing and surrounding stones used to construct both Khafre and Khufu.[22] In contrast, the erosion and weathering combined on Khafre’s face is minimal—even less than that which exists on the Tura limestone cap of the Khafre Pyramid itself. Therefore, the face on the Sphinx is a more recent construction than the rest of the monument, or these two pyramids.

![](img/7.webp)

**Exhibit A4** – The Sphinx (before its 1980’s ‘repair to keep it from toppling’ obfuscation) has clearly been re-purposed to honor Pharaoh Khafre from an earlier and much older monument which communicated something entirely different. There is only slight weathering on the re-purposed face. Notice the karst erosion on the cliffs in the background.

In this linked photo from the 1920s, as well as this one from the 1950s, one can observe that the karst erosion occurred to the Sphinx after the construction of the original pre-dynastic monument and before its repurposing by Pharaoh Khafre around 2500 BCE. This observation is significant and carries falsifying implications.

*There is absolutely zero possibility that Khafre or any of his Old Kingdom contemporaries built the original ‘Sphinx’ monument. The original monument existed long before their time and was exposed to a carbonic-acid-eroding inundation by ocean water, consistent with the same type of erosion observed on the Khufu and Khafre pyramids—not a Nile River flood, nor mere weathering, but a sustained ocean inundation.*

Finally, thermoluminescence dating of various carved granite structures on the Giza Plateau places the last alterations to Menkaure, the last pyramid of the three to be constructed, around 3,450 BCE (the time of Khufu’s tomb raider activity), and possibly as early as 4400 BCE, well before the Fourth Dynasty of Khufu.[23] This as well, falsifies the Khufu Narrative.

Similar to the rewriting of history that sought to erase Pharaoh Akhenaten, much of the history surrounding these critical Giza monuments has been re-purposed for dynastic nationalist exploitation.[24] What we are witness to here, is a series of skilled genocidal lies, something far worse than pop-archaeologist Flint Dibble’s ‘racism.’ This practice reveals why so many paradoxes exist within this subset of Egyptology. Oh what a tangled web we weave…

These issues all constitute significant problems, indicating how willing, nay desperate, archaeology is to lie about the age of these two edifices. That being said, I have no specific hypothesis of actual construction/origin by which to counter the Khufu-Khafre origin hypothesis. It remains a mystery. However, this is inherently the fault of the field and not me. Unfortunately, Egyptology has played the epistemological sleight-of-hand of doubling-down upon a theory they know has a high probability of being wrong, through continuously juxtaposing and foisting red herring and ludicrous competing alternatives (aliens, racists, giants, internal and external ramp solutions to a workload dilemma which does not even apply), such that there never exists any real challenge to their prevailing dogma. Stooge posing, as one does to prop up a less-talented boxer.

Is it any wonder therefore, why none of the observations which I am about to broach from this point on, have ever been raised regarding this topic? The fact that these ideas are ‘novel’, is a factor which casts nothing but doubt and shame upon the entire field. One may observe an example of why archaeology is a failed science by reading this article link.

It is evident that, since the onset of the Bronze Age, some intelligence concerning this pyramid threatens the powers that rule over us, terrifying them into committing despicable acts of pseudo-epistemology.

### Neither Aliens, Ramps, nor Giants – But Human Fingerprints

I’ve been the design engineer in charge of development of over 100 buildings in excess of 100,000 square feet in size. The largest facility my teams have engineered was 4.4 million square feet (that is large, take my word for it), and was much more complex than the Great Pyramid in its engineering challenge. Unlike an archaeologist, I am an expert in construction, scaling, cost and more importantly, the direct labor involved in the assembly of large structures under a variety of working conditions and construction equipment scenarios. My teams estimated these project costs, in part, based upon that principle of systems engineering cost measurement called work content (Wc).

![](img/8.webp)

**Exhibit B** – A ramp (internal, external, or otherwise) is not a viable solution for moving heavy objects to build a very large and labor-intensive monument. The more you construct ramps to alleviate friction or vertical loft, the less optimal becomes the overall challenge (i.e. the red line of increase in direct labor costs never recovers).

Under this, a tried and true principle of engineering applies to the Khufu pyramid construction, which is shown by the escalating red parametric intersection line in Exhibit B to the right:

*In absence of leverage, compound advantage, or machine, work content accelerates as a function of distance and structure used to overcome both vertical loft and that total friction which results from the employed solution.*

In other words, the more ramp you build (internal, external, or otherwise) in order to attain vertical loft or make friction easier, the more total work content (both direct and indirect) you create for the overall project. The more cooks, garbage haulers, housing, and logistics/support persons you need arithmetically. If the ramp surface is compromised, all work must stop until that problem is fixed, across a mile of ramp surface suffering 2.3 million stone passes. This would be fatal to the project’s critical path of completion. One also has to disassemble and/or mitigate the structural harm from this putative ramp, once the principal building effort is completed. That effort in itself could take decades to complete. Ramps therefore, constitute a losing game – they are the fantasy of historians, archaeologists, and Hollywood. Another advantage must be taken instead.

*Horizontal stone movement was a matter of trade in production surplus versus work content. “You mean to tell me Mr. Thoth, that you will give my village guaranteed food all year long, as long as we cut up pieces of the hillside and give them to your food delivery boats? Where do I sign?”*

*Vertical stone movement on the other hand, was a matter of slave work content alone. Risk of rebellion, disease, and especially expense – all needed to be minimized. Bored armies present risk.*

*Indeed, the challenge of the Great Pyramid resides not in the handful of 40 tonne precision stones which were involved, but rather in the 2.3 million 2.5 tonne stones which had to be vertically lifted into position – before famine, war, pestilence, drought, or economic collapse could cause a premature termination of the political will necessary to resume such an endeavor each year.*

Enter, the Sekhem-mu Machine and the Disk of Prince Sabu.

### The Sekhem-mu Machine and Its No-Longer-Missing Key Element

Therefore, under the non-recoverable principle entailed with work content vs friction as shown in Exhibit B, the Khufu and Khafre pyramids have to have been built through vertical mechanical advantage, using compound pulleys, with high saline content water (and manpower for marginal fine tuning, speed, and control) as the counterweight for each stone lifted. The salt water could be pumped to the top of the structure being built by means of a cleverly-engineered, Mohs scale 7 (measure of extreme mineral durability), impeller from the Hor-Anedjib pharaonic period (400 years before the reputed building of the Khufu pyramid), called the Disk of Prince Sabu.[25] ‘Sekhem-mu’ as a portmanteau means in Egyptian, ‘the power of water’.

![](img/9.webp)

**Exhibit C** – The Brilliance of the Pyramid Builders – The Sekhem-mu Machine based upon The Disk of Prince Sabu, a First Dynasty governor and the son of the famed Pharaoh Hor-Anedjib (2930 BCE), found in Sabu’s tomb in 1936 by British Egyptologist, Walter Bryan Emery.[26] This impeller device, and through dividing the loft distance into 25 ft machine-height-segments (you don’t have to pump water all the way from the bottom to the top of the pyramid, as the head pressure would be too high), solves the loft work-energy balance shortfall and thereby, most of the vertical challenge in building Khufu and Khafre. Neither ramps, aliens, nor giants are necessary in their construction.

Such leverage-water could be held in large (as much as 27 gallon/300 lb) containers used to 16:1 compound-advantage-lift one stone per level as the container(s) of water descended in its role as counterweight at each level of the pyramid (by means of four, four-fold purchase blocks). The water would then be either poured out at the bottom or even pumped back to the top, while the now-empty container could be easily hoisted back up (dead-heading) to the top again. Here, to be filled again with water to act as the counterweight for the next journey downward – each container of water lifting as many stones, as there were 4 level-steps (four times the length of pulled-rope is required in a four-fold purchase) upward in each single-leg trip. In this method, less scaffolding and zero ramp is required, while manpower is minimized for each stone-lift. The stones are in essence ‘pumped’ to the top of the structure by the gravitational-potential-energy of water instead.

**Disk of Prince Sabu** – Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Mohs 7 quartzite siltstone is difficult and time-consuming to work into a tool. Its radial symmetry and ring structure inside planar discipline is one magnitude in difficulty above even that. These elements were neither for artisanship nor mundane function. This device is elegantly and deliberately purposed to rotate, not be static. Any other alternative would present an enormous waste of critical artisan focus and effort.

Underpinning such a conjecture is this: to my educated eyes, the Sabu Disk is what is termed an open design water pump impeller, like the one’s I replace and repair on my boat, and not an out of place artifact nor ‘alien hyperdrive’. The Disk simply involves a ring with exterior mounted impeller blades (example can be found here – save for the normal-curve taper which imparts smoothness more compatible with muscle power as opposed to gas-powered machine). These normalized perimeter ‘blades’ are used in lieu of a spindle outfitted with center mounted and flexible impeller blades. Open impellers are commonly used in applications where the fluid contains slurry or particulates. In a centrifugal pump with an open impeller, the rotation of the impeller blades imparts kinetic energy to the fluid. This kinetic energy is converted to pressure energy as the fluid exits the impeller and moves into the pump casing, which directs the flow towards the discharge pipe.

Advantages of Open Impellers:[27]
- Better handling of stones and slurry
- Extended Mean Time Between Failure
- Easier to clean and clear on the fly
- Less prone to clogging

The normalized shape of the torroidal blades (more akin to a fin in its power and flexible delivery) equates to the flexible action of a neoprene, nitrile, or urethane Jabsco impeller blade—without the incumbent dry rot or material fatigue failure interval. This is brilliant, and no accident. The torroidal compression blades placed every 120 degrees on the Disk serve to displace the water into a centrifugal rotation, just as does an impeller blade in a Jabsco pump housing, which only has one path of escape, through the discharge outlet. The eye (inlet) is perpendicular to the plane of impeller rotation and offset 120 degrees from the outlet (see Exhibit C2), such that only a suction remains there, which serves to draw water in (once the infeed line and pump are primed).

![](img/11.webp)

**Exhibit C2 – Open Normalized-Vane Centrifugal Impeller** – Concept sketch – Sabu Disk used in place of Caterpillar 1766998 open centrifugal impeller.

The reason the Sabu Disk would preferentially be made of Mohs 7 quartzite siltstone (schist),[28] is because the bronze metals of the day would not have performed under stress. They are too soft. Ferrous based metals as an option, would have compromised quickly through electrochemical, chloride ion, conductive, and oxygen-based deterioration in the high-salinity (or even high-sediment content) water. Metals as a group absorb heat under high-friction, sun-heated, and dynamic stress conditions. As a heat sink – this would render them even softer under such steady all-day demand. Eventually metal impellers would deform after thousands of rotations, or when a small object came cascading through the pipes and jammed between the impeller and the pump housing. This all causing a disastrously low and more importantly, unprogrammable mean time between failure (MTBF) as compared to a stone device, which would feature none of these weaknesses.

*In no manner of employment or economic justification was this Disk a stone bowl, gigantic oil lamp, flying toy or weapon, flywheel, nor ancient astronaut artifact.[29] These are all ridiculous lob & slam notions, purposely pushed in order to confuse. The Sabu Disk is clearly and unequivocally, a fluid impeller.*

*I speculate that this is the reason why the Disk of Prince Sabu was regarded to be of such critical importance that it was placed in Sabu’s very own tomb. Just imagine the social impact he had with this prescient device.*

Now, with regard to the entire machine, having worked with several heads of state in Africa, I can tell you that rulers under the risk of rebellion are not nearly as concerned about the detailed engineering and devices employed (leaving that to my teams) as they are about managing ‘bored armies.’ Any wise pharaoh would be primarily concerned with the assembly of a large bored population used to haul counterweights, stones up ramps, or make repairs to frustrating solutions. Thus, the Disk of Prince Sabu is as much a political technology as it is a feat of engineering. It allowed one small team to rove from machine to machine and conduct the ‘lift’ right when the pumping dead-head cycle was complete for each machine (a two-person job). This system design could be minimally staffed and avoid chains of humans recovering stone weight during the machine’s dead-head cycle time for each and every machine.

Herodotus describes something very similar to this stone lifting machine in his work, An Account of Egypt (sans the necessary compound advantage and counter-weighting):[30]

*This pyramid was made after the manner of steps which some called “rows” and others “bases”: and when they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with machines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also…*

### The Insistent and Baseless Narrative

Several years ago, while working with my Egyptian client, I had the extraordinary opportunity to tour and climb off-limits areas (legally) inside and on the larger Giza pyramids. These fascinating tours left me trembling in awe each time I duckwalked through the primary passage into Khufu and on to the Grand Gallery. The air was uncomfortable and dank, but the monumental legacy of the surroundings made me oblivious to any discomfort.

![](img/12.webp)

TES touring the Giza Plateau.

During these observational visits I could detect the pyramid construction foreman’s use of fieldstone stacked slate placement technique – a technique used in particular by New England farmers to build pasture fences in the 1800’s or decorate homes today.[31] Except this was done in the horizontal plane and not the vertical. The foreman only need ensure discipline in the vertical plane surface – a highly level (Fl) and flat (Ff) surface in the engineering vernacular.[32] However in contrast, the foreman exploited the ‘convenient chaos’ of the arriving stone stream to provide him the shape resources he needed to fill in the horizontal plane puzzle. Just like one would construct a slate stone or stack stone fence.

Such an engineering challenge is plausible within the context of a Fourth Dynasty project for a single large pyramid. However, this challenge is exacerbated by the archaeological claim that the seven largest pyramids of the Third and Fourth Dynasties were all built within the same four decades. From a social infrastructure standpoint, this means they were essentially constructed simultaneously. Having developed numerous community burden and impact assessments for large building projects, I can attest that the demands on Egyptian society for just one pyramid would have been extraordinary. Constructing seven overlapping pyramids is a fantasy entertained only by those who have never built anything in their life.

![](img/13.webp)

**Chronology of Pharaohs and Their ‘Burial Chambers’** – Either a gigantic pissing contest which would have destroyed Egypt as a nation, or a complete fan fiction developed by later dynastic nationalists and priests. The five pyramids in blue did not match the technological prowess, concealed features, and experience of the two pyramids highlighted by the green Gantt bars (passage vertical girdle stones, corner-load intersection blocks, sequential granite relieving chambers, precision air shafts, devised system to handle the average stone dimensions and weight, 70-ton precision granite block fitting, highly complex non-staggered joints, etc.) – as all this seemed far beyond the technological capability of the other five pyramid builders – despite their being contemporary and residing only 25 km apart. The blue Gantt bar pyramids were not ‘trial runs’ – as there were no ‘lesson’s learned’ from Khufu and Khafre incorporated into Menkaure. As in the case of ramps, the idea only works as a child’s explanation of what occurred here.

*The Fourth Dynasty engineers attempted to imitate what they could readily observe inside Khufu (particularly the corbeled ceiling of the Grand Gallery), but they could neither truly replicate its feats, nor even more compellingly, reproduce Khufu’s concealed features and techniques.*

In short, it is absolutely clear that the Khufu and Khafre pyramids were built by humans. But if it was not the humans of Khufu’s Fourth Dynasty, then which humans indeed constructed these monuments? And why would the Orthodoxy work so hard (lie, as we have proven above) to ensure that we remain in abject ignorance over the matter? A matter so panic-inducing that they would be willing to cast every single person who dissented, as alien-theorists or racists.

Perhaps there exists another clue in this regard, a clue which portends an answer to both of these questions.

## Natural Tapestry Belies an Insistent Narrative

As mentioned at the outset of this article, I don’t have a plausibility or ontological issue with a Pharaonic Old Kingdom origin for Khufu and Khafre—I maintain an epistemological one. We’ve shown above that a classic Egyptian context for development of the Giza Complex is certainly appropriate from a technological and labor resource perspective. What I have a problem with, is being lied to, being gaslighted, and intellectual stagnation being passed off as ‘the scientific method’. I have a problem as well when directly falsifying and irrefutable evidence is ignored by those same actors who are doing the lying.

![](img/14.webp)

Fortunately, nature has preserved for us a rather informative spectacle in the demarcation of Tura and Mokkatam limestone on the Khafre pyramid at Giza, the highest elevation of the three primary pyramids at Giza. Mokkatam limestone is quarried from the Mokkatam formation, located directly underneath the Giza Plateau, 500 meters south of the pyramid’s southern edge. This limestone is a dense and durable form, consisting of older strata concretions of calcite, quartz, dolomite, and halite.[33] Its composition makes Mokkatam limestone highly resistant to the action and chemistry of ocean water (Mohs hardness of 6 or 7, Slake Durability Index of 95%), a process known as ‘karstification’ (Ford D., Karst Hydrology (2007) – referred to here as ‘karst erosion’ for clarity).[34] [35] Due to its low friability and high compressive strength, the builders of the Khafre pyramid employed Mokkatam limestone for the structural blocks that compose the main load-bearing courses (layers) and backing stones of the pyramid.

In contrast, Tura limestone is a relatively soft form of limestone (Mohs hardness of 3 or 4, Slake Durability Index of less than 85%, and higher friability). It has a much more leachable microstructure and consists entirely of vulnerable calcite (CaCO₃).[36] This renders this form of limestone vulnerable to dissolution in seawater by means of the following chemical equation:[37]

*CaCO3​(s) (Tura limestone) + CO2(aq) ​(carbon dioxide) + H2​O(l) (water) → Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO3–(aq) ​(calcium bicarbonate) + loose incomplete and undissolved CaC03(s) heavier than ocean water solids.*

Keep these ‘loose incomplete and undissolved CaCO3 heavier solids’ in mind as you continue to read. This carbonic acid process plays a significant role in the natural weathering of limestone and other carbonate rocks. It is also crucial in the formation of karst landscapes, where the differential dissolution of various hardness limestone by acidic salt water leads to the creation of caves, sinkholes, salt spalling, tafoni pitting, alveolar weathering, and other karstification features, especially along coastlines. The builders of the Khufu and Khafre pyramids chose the softer limestone for the decorative casing, because of its beauty and ease of workability into a smooth outer casing surface. But this had also rendered the casing vulnerable to karst weathering and erosion (see footnote regarding the distinction) by ocean water, an event which the builders understandably had not felt the need to anticipate.[38]

![](img/15.webp)

**Exhibit D** – Karst undercutting erosion of the Tura limestone cap of the Khafre pyramid at Giza. The erosion turns up parabolically at both ends, characteristic of wave-action induced seawall erosion at 90 degree corners in harbors and ocean breaks.

As a qualified Officer of the Deck, Navigator, and lifelong sailor, I have grown used to observing the effects of ocean water erosion, including karst and seawall erosion, on a variety of structures around ports and along coastlines. As we toured the Giza complex, I inquired of my driver/guide the reason for the removal of the Tura casing stones from both the Khufu and Khafre pyramids. He responded “Mr. G, they say that the stones are reused in ancient buildings down in the local community; but in truth, no one knows what happened to them. As you can see, if indeed the [Tura limestone casing] stones were scavenged, I find it odd that none remain laying along the bottom of the pyramids themselves. Also, why did they stop at that cap?”

In fact, there are some remaining casing stones which were not carted off and still reside at the base of Khafre: they are all made of granite (Mohs 7) or were covered by sand and therefore only partially karst/travertine eroded and reconcreted.[39] [40] Such is a Sherlock Holmes worthy deductive clue, as only the seawater-solvable blocks had disappeared from both the pyramid itself, as well as the entire Giza complex.

![](img/16.webp)

**Exhibit E** – Karst erosion band is created by a pause in the sea level of a dramatic ocean inundation from antiquity. Its marks have been left for us to ponder and draw inference – both in the form of horizon-disciplined and wave-chaotic signatures, placed at just the correct height separation which natural ocean sea state variance would serve to impart.

Then it hit me. The Tura limestone casing blocks had not been scavenged at all. Nor could this possibly have been from an earthquake, which selectively disturbed only Tura, but not Mokattam. The patterning and undercut nature of the stone depletion made that notion a ridiculous fairy tale (see Exhibits D and E above and to the right). The Tura limestone blocks had been dissolved, dissolved through both the ferocious kinetics, as well as carbonic acid chemistry – of ocean water. Just as in the case of the Leo Stela at Nimrud Dag while working in Turkey, or King Solomon’s Lost Mine of Ophir while working in Africa, the realization hit me inescapably, like a ton of bricks.

*One may encounter the eyes of enigma for years, and suddenly, in a single glance, comprehend it utterly and completely—a penetrating affair that renders a thousand prior gazes entirely moot.*

*I was silent in the car on the way back to the hotel, my stomach hanging like lead under the weight of what I had just seen. My colleagues even inquired if I was well. I was not.*

### The Metrics and Evidence

Accordingly, I have outlined the measures and dynamics of this particular form of karst erosion, in Exhibits F, G, and H below. The grey area in Exhibits F and H, represents an ocean level which is 576 feet higher than our current day normal. This represents the height of ocean above current sea level which is required to create this fast-paced karst erosion visible on both the Khufu, and especially the Khafre, pyramids.

A 576 ft pause in this sea level is the origin of that light colored karst erosion band shown in the Exhibit E photo to the immediate right above – as well as in Exhibits F and G below. This erosion band was caused by a highly energized ocean, averaging a sea state of 6 to 8, over a significant period of time. I have sailed a ship in sea states 7 and 9 before. These were terrifying events, with waves taller than my bridge wing and ship.

Thereafter, the waters appear to have retracted almost as quickly as they encroached. This is a warning flag that we should heed and understand as mankind. Take your time in examining Exhibit F below, as it is packed with relevant deductive observation.

![](img/17.webp)

**Exhibit F – Khafre Pyramid Seawater Erosion Band** – Tura limestone inundation erosion vulnerability to seawater, contrasted by Mokkatam limestone durability (structure) and nominal Tura weathering (casing). The erosion band measures match the erosion characteristics of an average sea state of 6 to 8 at a high water pause. The height of water at this pause equates to a 264′ (Khafre base altitude) + 312′ (inundation mark height on Khafre pyramid) = a 576 ft global or regional inundation.[41]

Below, one can observe the horizon-disciplined (as in water-level) karst erosion which is centered around the 312′ level (576′ above sea level) of the Khafre pyramid. There is only one factor which can cause such an erosion pattern. In a Holmesian sense, even though this factor may seem like an implausibility, the characteristics of these marks serve to eliminate every other possibility, and we are left with only one possible answer. This was caused by a global or regional inundation.

![](img/18.webp)

**Exhibit G** – The horizon-disciplined nature of the karst erosion serves to falsify every competing notion as to how the Tura limestone blocks had been removed from the Khafre pyramid at Giza. As well, the parabolic erosion rises from wave action become readily apparent on all four sides of the undercut Tura limestone cap.

![](img/19.webp)

**Exhibit G2** – This is deductive proof. Any narrative of pyramid construction-dating must definitively explain this karst-kinetic erosion, or it is not a scientific hypothesis.

Of course the natural question arises, ‘Why did this same uneroded Tura limestone cap not occur on the Khufu pyramid as well?’ The first part of this answer lies in the relative altitudes of each pyramid’s peak. The Khafre pyramid, despite being slightly less tall than the Khufu pyramid, nevertheless, sits upon a higher Giza plateau section than does Khufu. This turned out to be just high enough to preserve 110 feet of Tura limestone casing, which extended above the level of this catastrophic ocean condition.

In answer to this question however, the Tura cap (or pyramidion) on Khufu did exist. First, there is a minimal Tura structure viable which can support its own weight long term (earthquakes, weathering of mortar, etc.). Plus, the cap of Khufu was renowned to conceal a quantity of gold or at least, gold plating. The entire cap was removed and purportedly reassembled on the ground level on the southeast side of Khufu.[42] I have seen this pyramidion up close, but have no idea whether or not it is the original.

So, there is no doubt that, unlike the case of Khafre, the Khufu Tura cap was manually removed.

![](img/20.webp)

**Exhibit H** – The rationale behind why this Tura limestone cap only appeared (fortunately) on the Khafre pyramid and not the Khufu pyramid as well. The location of the candidate wave trough line on Khufu can be seen by examining this enhanced top-down image set.

### Deductive Reconcretions and Archaeological Buffoonery

*+ loose incomplete and undissolved CaC03(s) heavier than ocean water solids.*

Accordingly, we are left with a sustained and specific sea level oceanic displacement as the only viable explanation for the unique features we document in this article. Not a 371 day biblical flood, not a tidal wave, not a cosmic impact, and not an interloping gravitational visitor to our solar system – but rather, a long-term and Earth rotational mechanics derived, oceanic displacement. Something befitting a disruption or magnetic decoupling of our planet’s rotational component masses commensurate with a weakening of the Earth’s geomagnetic moment (inner/outer core magnetic coupling with the outer rotational mantle/asthenosphere/lithosphere). An event which is happening once again, from 1973 until now (see chart here).[43]

![](img/21.webp)

In fact, desert sand base shaped calcium carbonate re-concretions at the foot of the Pyramids (click on image above to see these ‘heavier than ocean water solids’ re-concretions), confirm that the Tura limestone was dissolved, not removed. The incomplete and undissolved portions of the calcite plummeted to the foot of the pyramid and re-concreted over time. One can observe the resulting karst/travertine erosion in this photo of the lesser effected base of Tura limestone casing stones. This is unmistakable evidence of oceanic inundation. Had this observation been managed by scientific professionals, the material in the photo to the above right would not have been ignored so carelessly. Such buffoonery exemplifies why ignorance and paradox continue to surround these two pyramids.

The inside of the South Air Shaft running from the Queen’s Chamber also exhibits this same karst/travertine erosion in sections where the limestone is of lower Mohs durability. In this linked photo from the Djedi Project as well, one can observe both the travertine erosion of the Tura limestone walls (appears as if the limestone wall is ‘melted’), coupled with efflorescence crystalline encrustations growing off the travertine surface of the stone from ocean water leaching.[44]

*ChatGPT-4o comments on these photos linked above: The features you are observing, including the smooth, weathered surface with rounded pocks and the newer, sharper encrustations, are consistent with a history of travertine erosion followed by salt efflorescence. This supports the hypothesis that the shaft experienced prolonged exposure to mineral-rich water, possibly from an oceanic source, followed by evaporation and salt deposition.*

Additionally, in his work “The pyramids and temples of Gizeh,” which comprises the notes of British Egyptologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Petrie wrote following observations during his excavations and examinations of the Subterranean Chamber of Khufu.[45]

*Soon after passing this granite, we got into the lower part of the entrance passage, which was clear nearly to the bottom. Here a quantity of mud had been washed in by the rains, from the decayed limestone of the outside of the Pyramid, thus filling the last 30 feet of the slope. … The limestone was easily smashed then and there, and carried out piecemeal; and as it had no worked surfaces it was of no consequence.  (S5-[S13]-P16-[C3]-L31)*

Indeed, in 1611, François Savary de Brèves confirmed that the subterranean chamber passage was “completely plugged up to the upper chamber access point” (see Exhibit H2 below). Additionally, this 1950s photo (right) of Egyptologist Adam Rutherford working in the upper section of the Subterranean passage, compared to that same passage as it is today, shows almost a foot of filled-in and over ancient re-concreted limestone (soft and foot-worn, not bedrock) in that passageway. This had accumulated upon the unchanged bedrock base of the passage, which would bear minimal foot-wear if any at all. Obviously, this concretion has been filled in/covered, and is likely still there if archaeology had the ethical gumption to take a sample of it.

![](img/22.webp)

Thus, you were mistaken Sir William Flinders Petrie, this limestone was indeed of consequence. Your prior assumption that this edifice was a tomb built in 2500 BCE, lack of scientific discipline, and shortfall in broad experience in materials, geology, and oceanography harmed this archaeological process. From these notes it is clear that the limestone which blocked the subterranean flat passage

1. was from the decayed limestone on the outside of the pyramid. Notice there was no sand, which would have blown onto the outer stones and washed with the rain and dissolved limestone into and down the passage. So this could not possibly be from rain,

2. was transported there by inundation-carriage alone, as rains could not possibly build 30 ft of structure only at the bottom, because running rain water over thousands of years would have produced a long limestone and sand encrusted rill (intermittent-flow ‘creek-bed’ formation) down the entire length of the passage instead,

3. had aggregated into this massive concretion structure long after the pyramid’s construction, and

4. such structure was often carelessly removed by those who did not comprehend that this concretion was predictive evidence and should not have been destroyed without professional archaeological documenting.[46] [47]

Petrie continues by describing the horizontal passage cut into the limestone bedrock running south from the Subterranean Chamber as follows (here again, Petrie did not follow scientific protocol, operating from a flawed prior assumption):[48]

*The little horizontal passage, which leads southward from the Subterranean Chamber…  The floor of this little passage is covered throughout with a dark earthy material like mould, two to three inches deep.”  (S1-[S305]-P157-L14)*

![](img/23.webp)

**Exhibit H2 – Flinders Petrie Notes** – This even deposition of 3 inches of ‘earthy material’ in the small 53 foot long, 2.5 ft tall, southward horizontal passage, which remained untouched due to its relative inaccessibility, suggests oceanic deposition.[49] The material could not have been deposited by ambient air or rain. Silt deposition standards indicated that 2 to 3 inches of this deposition in ocean near to land, would take around 35 to 55 years to accumulate (3″ = 76 years by open ocean standard).[50] This matches the estimated erosion interval required for Khafre’s Tura limestone karst-band. Taken in addition, the heavy accumulation of reconcreted Tura limestone constitutes a ‘dead body’ deductive set of evidence. These two observations rule out rain, Nile river, or human-fed inundation – only ocean inundation could have caused these unique features.

Moreover, salt encrustations found within the Queen’s Chamber of the Khufu pyramid as well as the Grand Gallery might serve to confirm the overarching seawater inundation construct.[51] However, (here once more) we do not hold a sample of this salt. We must recognize that some ‘salts’ (chemical compound class, not sodium chloride per se) can be derived from limestone given specific conditions: efflorescence of potassium nitrate or two other chemical salts through exposure to ocean water as well (calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate).[52] [53] Ocean salt would only remain in certain ideal conditions and places – which is indeed the observed case. Effloresence in contrast should be ubiquitous, yet this is not the observed case. Evidentially, the lack of such efflorescence homogeneously distributed throughout the pyramid weakens this argument approach however, making it appear desperate and ad hoc. Furthermore, from a logical standpoint, a purported shortfall (which is actually false, see Upuaut Project photo to the right) in detecting these three ocean-water-derived salts does not critically undermine our hypothesis presented here.

![](img/24.webp)

*…but beyond this, on to the Queen’s Chamber, the very thick and hard incrustation of salt which entirely covers the walls of this passage, made it impossible for us to locate the joints with any certainty. This salt incrustation is peculiar to the Horizontal Passage and Queen’s Chamber, although a little of it may also be seen on the walls of the First Ascending Passage.*

*~ John and Morton Edgar, Great Pyramid Passages Vol 1 1910 edition*

Nonetheless, inaccessible salt encrustations which cannot feasibly be from efflorescence (by the deductive logic we just cited above), and therefore had to be derived from direct ocean water exposure, have been recently found on Queen’s Chamber north air shaft ceiling blocks (see Upuaut Project photo above taken more than half way up the north air shaft’s 75 meter length). Again here, the lack of chemical sampling of this salt is a deficiency of the discipline of the archaeological prevailing Narrative. This was critical path evidence, neglected through professional buffoonery.

*Notice here, a key differentiating warning flag within philosophy: The prevailing ‘burial chamber’ narrative becomes stronger only as less and less information is found or retained.*

Such evidence suggests an entirely new possible rationale behind the existence of mysterious pictographs[54] or the myriad ancient stone circles which track the seasonality, rising, and setting of the sun and moon. Perhaps these were neither fanciful art nor seasonal calendars, as much as they might have been a warning indicator – that it was high time to get to higher ground. Archaeology, perhaps inadvertently and in an effort to avoid any evidence that might even hint at supporting a biblical flood, has created an echo chamber of sorts inside their own profession, leading to an overall ignorance vacuum regarding this topic.

### Impossible? Think Again…

The reality is that this natural tapestry doesn’t merely express it self upon the Khafre and Khufu pyramids alone. In fact, it shows throughout the entire landscape of the Arabian desert and into northern Africa. I spent a couple years off and on traveling the Arabian peninsula and Saudi Empty Quarter – surveying the region during a national strategy I conducted for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There I observed the ancient receding shoreline structures in the Empty Quarter for months before it finally hit me as to what these indeed were. They are recent (less than 12 kya) ocean shorelines. If you were indoctrinated as I was, and believed for decades that since we did not know about it that such a flood was impossible, this will serve to limit your perceptive abilities. Once you see this however, you will not be able to forget it thereafter.

![](img/25.webp)

**Exhibit I – Shows the Extent of a 576 ft Inundation** – A 576 ft inundation elegantly fills the entire green area (595′ and lower) on this topographical map – to include the Saudi Empty Quarter as well as the entirety of the Nile Delta and Giza Plateau.[55]

Now compare Exhibit I to the Google Earth satellite composites of the region (Exhibit J below), displaying washways, saline flats/deserts, and iron oxide (orange) depositions at high-water marks.

![](img/26.webp)

**Exhibit J – The Saudi Empty Quarter and Regional/Global Inundation** – the saline-iron oxide washways, receding shoreline, and high water marks in the Saudi Empty Quarter make it clear that a 600 ft context or higher ocean inundation likely formed both the unique geographic features in the region, and as well could have easily inundated the Giza Plateau.

*The momentary oceanic surges inside these washways, as evidenced by the fine iron oxide orange colorations in Exhibit J above, rose to as high as 2355 feet above sea level for a very short period. I find it intriguing that our oldest large-scale human habitations, Göbekli Tepe and its contemporary site Karahan Tepe (see Pillar 43 dating and topological maps here), are both situated on hilltops at approximately 2500 feet in elevation. Why did ancient humans choose these elevated locations when their food sources were located in the Harran Plain well below them?*

While we present two pieces of compelling evidence in the form of Khafre erosion and geological features of the Saudi Peninsula—each acting as a form of white crow (dead body) evidence that falsifies previous conventional theories—this is not the only evidence of a partial-Earth inundation. It’s important to note that, while our goal is not to promote Noah’s Flood or Creationist theories, such evidence of a partial inundation does exist.[56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Exhibit K below shows the clear consistency in the 2350 ft ‘high flow marks’ of this same inundation, along with the resulting salt water flat, a signature feature of such inundation zones.

![](img/27.webp)

**Exhibit K – Emi Koussi Volcano Pass and Salt Flats Oceanic Displacement Formation** – undeniable remnants of an oceanic displacement within the last 12,000 years. Since this flow has edges which form a consistently channeled ‘sea level’ at 2,355 ft (everything above 2,355 ft is different from everything below that level), which match the same inundation patterns in the Saudi Peninsula (Exhibit J) – this cannot be from prevailing winds.

Neither is this an ancient lake desiccation (contrast with Salton Sea Retraction), as there are no long-eroded tributaries feeding this depression and no appreciable receding shoreline, even considering the shifted sands. If these features were erased and covered by the sands, then the salt flats would have been buried even more easily, and first, by the same mechanism.

A video posted six months after this article was released, by UnchartedX, adeptly highlights the extensive erosion on the limestone blocks at the base of the Khafre pyramid. However, they overlooked the karst-carbonic acid factor we cite as part of this hypothesis and instead referenced a classic friction-only scenario, suggesting that it would take 12,000 years to erode a structure by 2 feet through normal water-borne action. According to our hypothesis, this is not how the softer limestone (Mohs 3 or 4) blocks/pockets eroded at all. The pitting and scooping seen in the video are indicative of Mohs 3/4 chemical erosion, not mere physical friction from rain, wind, sand, air, or water. What they are inspecting in the video is the Mohs 5+ harder limestone, which survived the karst chemical action, thereby giving them a false reference upon which to base a time scale.

### Ominous Implications of The Nubian Ostrich Egg (4500 – 5000 BCE)

Artifacts discovered in recent history serve to corroborate the antiquity of both the Giza Pyramids and the receding waters we propose and observe in Exhibits I, J, and K above. British archaeologist Mallaby Cecil Firth discovered an ancient ostrich egg, dated 6,500 – 7,000 years ago, in 1907 from inside a tomb from the Nagada Nile river culture. In Exhibits L and M below (courtesy of Jimmy Corsetti in the linked Bright Insight YouTube video), this artifact, known as the Nubian Ostrich Egg is shown, which arguably depicts the three Giza Pyramids, the Nile River, and the Faiyum Basin filled with an elevated sea level of approximately 100 feet (circa 4500–5000 BCE).[63]

*The receding of the waters in the Faiyum Basin arguably places the date of the Khafre/Khufu erosion inundation as late as 4600 BCE.*

*The reader should also note that the courses (horizontal lines) of pyramid construction depicted in these etchings would not have been visible had the pyramids still been covered in their Tura limestone casing stones at the time of observation and sketching. This suggests that the stones were removed by this same inundation.*

**Exhibits L (Nile Sketch) and M (Faiyum Basin Sketch)** – The Ethical Skeptic’s analysis of the Nubian Ostrich Egg – dated to 4500 – 5000 BCE. Just as we observed in Exhibit J above, the water levels in the Faiyum valley have retreated over the last 7,000 – 11,600 years into a hypersaline lake called today, Lake Moeris (the deepest blue depression area in Exhibit M). This area is filled with karst erosion features, sea shells dated to 4600 to 5300 BCE, and ancient aquatic animal bones—including an extensive concentration of younger fossils to such a degree of preservation that even some stomach contents are intact.[64]

As shown in the top panel of Exhibit N to the right, notice that the first ring around the top of the egg, centered upon the hole cut into the top, appears to depict a cyclical timeline. The ring is divided into 64 segments, with two of those segments crosshatched and pointing to the three Pyramids of Giza. This suggests an anomaly or exception within this 6,400-year cycle, lasting for a duration of up to 200 years—an anomaly which is poignantly connected by the artist to the three Giza Pyramids. A conceptual sketch I developed can be seen by clicking on Exhibit M to the right.[65]

**Exhibit N** – Proposed Nubian Egg True Polar Wander Cycle etching. Shows Giza Pyramids 2,000 years before they were supposedly constructed, and proposes a cyclical timeline for some event associated with them. For meaning of ‘State 1’ and ‘State 2’ refer to this article. This etching suggests a cyclical event lasting 200 years, every 6,400 years. As well, the two lines struck through the Pyramids themselves bear a 104° angle between them.

Curiously as well, the two angled lines struck through the pyramids etched onto the egg (Exhibit N bottom panel), bear a 104° angle between them. The significance of this will be demonstrated in our next article, which outlines the critical implication of this measure inside our ECDO Hypothesis.

The 6,400 year cycle aligns well (for now) with a draft timeline I am in the process of developing for this cyclical rotational true polar wander. This cycle interval and duration will be the subject of a later article. This also matches well, the bottleneck in Y-DNA inside humanity, which occured 5000 – 7000 years before present.[66] [67]

*Using a data set of 125 Y-chromosome sequences from modern humans, Karmin et al. inferred an intense bottleneck in Y-chromosomes in various geographical regions of the Old World around 5000–7000 BP, suggesting a decline in the male effective population size during the Neolithic to approximately one-twentieth of its original level before the Neolithic in regions including Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.*

~ Zeng, et al. Neolithic Y-chromosome Bottleneck, 2018.

This would explain the wording posed to Herodotus on the part of the priests of Ptah in his work “An Account of Egypt,” citing two events consisting of four rising and setting movements (see Herodotus’ quote which follows below). The cycling between State 1 and State 2, twice, would entail four total rising and setting changes, comprised inside 13,800 years (11,340 + 440 bce + 2020 ce = 13,800 years).[68] The astute systems engineer will note that a two-cycle interval of 12,800 years comprised by a 13,800 year context does not leave much slack time.

*Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings who arise in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting;*

~ Herodotus, An Account of Egypt, 440 BCE

Nonetheless, this substantial body of evidence has been largely overlooked due to fake skepticism and an indignant overreaction against the often flawed or biased Noah’s Flood research of previous centuries. A straw man fallacy is at play: if one cites even a regional inundation, they must be promoting the biblical flood and creationism. This is simply ignorance in action from both extremist camps, leaving those of us caught in the middle weary. We contend there is a stronger argument now at play—a Holmesean deductive one.

Species of Holmesean deduction (far more powerful than mere statistical, suggestive, or inductive evidence):

**White crow** – a specific element of evidence falsifies Prevailing Theory A, while simultaneously proving antithetical or competing Alternative B.

**Dead body** – a specific element of evidence falsifies Prevailing Theory A, which establishes necessity for a non-specific alternative to Theory A (Ockham’s Razor).

*If I find a dead body in the living room immediately after a party, it doesn’t matter how many expert attendees testify that the party went fine; the dead body proves otherwise. Khafre’s erosion marks and base/Subterranean Chamber limestone reconcretions constitute a ‘dead body’. Ockham’s Razor has been surpassed.*

Aside from the examples of professional buffoonery we outlined above, the only reason such obvious dead body evidence would be ignored is if it introduces a history that threatens the religious fervor of anti-diluvialism. Hence the strident levels of straw man and ignoratio elenchi surrounding this topic. Watch patiently over the coming years; you will find that the denial of this more reasonable version of Earth’s cataclysmic history is a common theme behind most enforced historical and archaeological narrative. Be especially cautious of appeals to acceptance—the assertion that because one theory is generally accepted, no evidence exists for any alternative theories.

### An Epilogue in Exothermic-Dzhanibekov Redistribution

As a side note, I find it curious that whatever the mechanism is that caused this rise in sea level, it appears to be cyclic as opposed to chaotic in nature. Much as if the LLVP structures of the inner mantle serve to impart a Dzhanibekov effect in the Earth’s rotation, given sufficient mass redistribution. In other words, aside from an initial quick surge of maybe 1500-2200 ft, the oceans in this case settled at a specific height (576′ above sea level and 312′ up the pyramid height), stayed there for some amount time, and then returned more gradually to their current context in a machine-like manner. The only global-scale mechanism I can think of which could cause such an iron oxide infused surge, overlain upon a normal curve in sea level retreat (to the necessary exclusion of plate tectonics and celestial interlopers), is the mechanics of Earth’s rotation – an effect generated by a chaotic Earth core perhaps.[69]

*Is it possible that the reason Earth took 800 million years to host a comprehensively advanced civilization from more complex forms of Eukaryote life is that the Earth tends to topple every so often, setting things back significantly? This could render our planet semi-stable, as opposed to our assumed stable planetary profile—a garden paradise with one essential disqualifying flaw. Perhaps this made our planetary resource ideal to serve as a genetic farm, where the stress of mass extinction spurred further and more aggressive speciation, but it remained unsuited for permanent large-scale habitation by higher-order beings (unless they were fleeing as outlaws)?*

Owing to the pervasive influence of narrow-minded skepticism and a rigidly controlled narrative, humanity often finds itself disconnected from a true comprehension of its own nature and origins. The dating and age of the pyramids at Giza appears to play a pivotal role in unraveling the obscured chapters of human history. Consequently, these insights seem to have been deliberately omitted from our collective understanding by authoritative entities.

![](img/31.webp)

Had it not been for the distinct erosion patterns on the Khafre pyramid, I might have readily accepted the official narrative, relegating theories of an older pyramid age to the realm of mere speculation. However, my trust lies more firmly in my own ability to identify corruption, to infer and deduce, and to unravel mysteries, than in those who craft and uphold prevailing dogma. The reluctance of scientists to perform carbon-14 testing on the seemingly over-cooked red ochre paint within the Khufu pyramid’s relieving chambers raises significant suspicions. This hesitance regarding something so important, yet so straightforward, strikes me as a telling indicator of underlying malice.

I am not inclined to immediately conclude that this inundation and the biblical flood are one in the same. I am not ruling that out certainly, but we need a lot more information first. However, I also find it hard to believe that a flood of such magnitude — as evidenced by these undeniable erosion patterns — could have occurred within the last 4500 years without being more prominently recorded in history, beyond the accounts of Noah’s Flood or the Sumerian Epic of Utinapishtim. It seems more plausible that this event took place far earlier than our documented history, or what has been permitted to be recorded. This leads to a necessary questioning of the inductive science that supports the prevailing narrative. Indeed, none of these scientific interpretations appear to be as compelling as the natural tapestry in evidence plainly set before us.

*Everyday day, brings us closer. Every night, my soul sees*
*A troubled mankind, suffering blindly*

*So let the traces linger on. Many years have come and gone.*
*Oh how lonely man has been, without a trace of the Traceless Friend*

~ Seals & Crofts, ‘The Euphrates’

While I do not claim to hold the definitive answers regarding the architects or the underlying purposes of these enigmatic structures, one thing seems increasingly clear: significant secrets have been obscured, lost not only in the realms of ancient engineering but also in the deeper rendering of humanity’s origins. These pyramids, standing as silent witnesses to a forgotten epoch, challenge us to look beyond accepted narratives, urging us to rediscover and reconnect with lost chapters of our collective and yes, spiritual past.

In their enduring mystery, they remind us as skeptics that history is not just a record of what we know, but a testament to the vast expanse of what we have yet to understand, along with the responsibility to resist agency and winnow the unknown.

Project Gutenberg; Herodotus: An Account of Egypt: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2131/2131-h/2131-h.htm,&#8221;Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me: Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but after him Cheops became king over them and brought them to every kind of evil: for he shut up all the temples (this would have been during the time of Ptah), and having first kept them from sacrifices there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred thousand men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it is highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this they said, the ten years were spent, and for the underground he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile. For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than thirty feet in length.

This pyramid was made after the manner of steps which some called “rows” and others “bases”: and when they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with machines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However that may be the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was spent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been expended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon bread and clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for the time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time besides, as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in working at the excavation under the ground? Cheops moreover came, they said, to such a pitch of wickedness, that being in want of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did not tell me): and she not only obtained the sum appointed by her father, but also she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her a memorial, and she requested each man who came in to give her one stone upon her building: and of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, each side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.

This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king followed the same manner of dealing as the other, both in all the rest and also in that he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that which was built by the former (this I know, having myself also measured it), and moreover there are no underground chambers beneath nor does a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other, in which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round an island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a basement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours; and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards size, building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the same hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said reigned fifty and six years. Here then they reckon one hundred and six years, during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all that time. These kings the Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them are not very willing to name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.”

Bullshit Rhetoric and Dysethics: “64 organic samples were collected from the mortar of the pyramidS and their associated temples”, “Both classic archaeologist and alternative researchers were disappointed by the results.” Thereafter averaging the 1995 study results and then again averaging that date with the 1984 study result (significance problem) to get the latest date possible, and shifting the Fourth Dynasty back 100 years, both to get a more favorable-sounding gap (“374 years”) which can then be dismissed as noise. Complete dishonesty. 

9. The notion that these pigments cannot be carbon-14 dated is false, with ChatGPT-4 only admitting this when held to account: “The red ochre pigments used in the relieving chambers of the Khufu pyramid have not been carbon-14 dated. Carbon-14 dating, or radiocarbon dating, is a method used to date materials that contain organic carbon, typically from once-living organisms. Since red ochre is an inorganic iron oxide pigment, it does not contain organic carbon and therefore cannot be directly carbon-14 dated.” When challenged with “The vehicle and binder in ochre is not iron oxide, it is organic in derivation in all instances of human use.”, ChatGPT-4 responded: “You’re correct that pigments in paints, including ochre, are typically mixed with a vehicle and binder to create the paint. In the case of the red ochre pigments used in the Khufu pyramid, the binder would have been an organic material, which theoretically could be subjected to carbon-14 dating if samples were available and well-preserved.

14. Microbial Activity: Iron-oxidizing bacteria, such as those from the genus Leptothrix or Gallionella, can thrive in environments where iron is available. These bacteria oxidize ferrous iron (Fe²⁺) to ferric iron (Fe³⁺), resulting in the precipitation of iron oxides. The chemical reaction is as follows: 4Fe2++O2+6H2O→4Fe(OH)3+8H+4Fe2++O2​+6H2​O→4Fe(OH)3​+8H+

Resulting Patina: The ferric iron (Fe³⁺) precipitates as ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), which eventually dehydrates to form iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe₂O₃) or goethite (FeO(OH)). These iron oxides impart a red or orange color to the patina on a limestone surface. Hematite typically produces a red color, while goethite can range from yellow to brown to orange.

37. To measure a mineral’s resistance to erosion by ocean water, you would typically use a material’s hardness scale and its chemical bond durability or ‘weathering resistance’. Here are some scales and concepts that are relevant, in order:

1. Mohs Hardness Scale – While primarily used for scratch resistance, it indirectly provides insight into a mineral’s ability to resist physical erosion. Example: Quartz (Mohs hardness of 7) is more resistant to erosion compared to calcite (Mohs hardness of 3).

2. Chemical Durability Carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite, limestone): More prone to chemical weathering and dissolution in acidic conditions.

3. Slake Durability Index (SDI) The Slake Durability Test evaluates the resistance of rock samples, including limestone, to disintegration when subjected to cycles of wetting and drying.

4. Rosiwal Scale – This scale measures the absolute hardness of minerals by quantifying the resistance of a material to a standardized abrasive force.

38. Please note: While the carbonic acid equation cited above technically constitutes ‘weathering,’ it is critical to comprehend that the resulting deposition/sludge/material has been transported away by the movement of ocean water (erosion). Therefore, I refer to this overall process as ‘erosion’ to clearly convey the reality of what is occurring. This terminology avoids the semantic nuances that might otherwise be exploited to downplay the significance of this feature.

41. The reason why the 0 sea state line does not bisect the crest to trough interval, as would exist in open sea conditions, is due to a principle called ‘Sea Wall Reflection”. Reflection: Waves hitting a sea wall are reflected back into the sea. This reflected wave can interact with incoming waves, leading to a phenomenon known as constructive interference, where the wave heights add together, creating higher wave crests. This effect causes the waterline to be more along the 35-40% level of interval height as opposed to 50% (bisecting), and as well, results in a parabolic rise at 90-degree corners, as is highlighted in the pyramid Tura limestone casing in the chart.

44. Salt Efflorescence: In environments where limestone is exposed to saline conditions, salt efflorescence can occur. This process involves the deposition of salts from evaporating water, which can leave behind crystalline encrustations. These salts can appear as sharp, protruding growths on the stone surface.

47. Here is how this process of Tura Limestone dissolving and re-concretion could theoretically unfold: ChatGPT-4: The hypothesis that the Tura limestone casing stones of the Great Pyramid could dissolve in seawater and subsequently form a calcium carbonate concretion at the base is scientifically plausible in a general sense. Reaction of Limestone with Carbonic Acid: Limestone, which primarily consists of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), can react with carbonic acid (H₂CO₃). Carbonic acid forms in seawater when carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air dissolves in water. The reaction between calcium carbonate and carbonic acid can lead to the dissolution of limestone. Formation of Calcium Bicarbonate: The chemical reaction in an aqueous environment (like seawater) typically converts calcium carbonate into calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂), which is both heavier than and soluble in water. Deposition and Concretion Formation: If the conditions change – for example, if the water evaporates or if the pH changes – the dissolved calcium bicarbonate can re-deposit as calcium carbonate. This re-deposition can form concretions or other sedimentary structures. In the specific context of the Great Pyramid’s casing stones: If these stones were submerged in seawater and conditions led to the dissolution of the limestone, the dissolution process would involve the formation of calcium bicarbonate. It’s possible that calcium carbonate could form concretions in the surrounding sand. This would depend on various factors such as local environmental conditions, the concentration of dissolved calcium bicarbonate, and the presence of nucleation points for crystal formation. In this hypothetical circumstance the Tura limestone dissolved, plummeted as a heavy solute to the foot of the pyramid as the waters receded, and then was carried and settled, not conveyed by rain runoff, to form re-concretions in the Subterranean Chamber lower passage only, and into the sand at the base of the pyramid (at that time). Hence the chaotic and sand-plumed bottom shape of the re-concretions in the photo above. Only an inundation could have caused these features.

56. James Trefil’s article, “Evidence for a Flood,” published in Smithsonian Magazine, explores the hypothesis that a catastrophic flood in the Black Sea region around 7,500 years ago may have inspired the biblical story of Noah’s flood. The article discusses geological and archaeological evidence supporting this theory, including sediment layers and the implications of rising sea levels from the Mediterranean into the Black Sea basin.

57. Lorence G. Collins’ article, “Yes, Noah’s Flood May Have Happened, But Not Over the Whole Earth,” published by the National Center for Science Education, explores the possibility that the biblical flood described in Genesis was a large regional flood in Mesopotamia rather than a global event. The article examines geological and historical evidence to support this theory. For more details, see Collins, L. G. (2009). Yes, Noah’s Flood May Have Happened, But Not Over the Whole Earth. National Center for Science Education. Available at: https://ncse.ngo/yes-noahs-flood-may-have-happened-not-over-whole-earth.

58. Jeffrey P Tomkins study, “Not only does the overall stratigraphic sequence of the Flood record correspond globally, but the data also show that the Flood transpired in a series of progressive inundations corresponding to each megasequence. These inundations were caused by a series of violent tsunami-like waves over the yearlong period of the Genesis Flood. These progressively higher ebb-and-flow events began their sediment and fossil deposition in the lowest regions of the continental shelf (shallow seas on the continental crust near land), proceeded to the edges of landmasses (lowland coastal regions), and then moved increasingly upward onto land until finally the entire pre-Flood landscape was under water.

This final stage of the Flood was characterized by vast amounts of water and sediment draining across and pouring off the continents. Much of this sediment deposition took place in large basins on land next to the uplifting mountain ranges and offshore in the deepening oceans.” For more details, see Tompkins, et al.; Developing a Comprehensive Model of Global Flood Paleontology: Integrating the Biostratigraphic Record with Global Megasequence Deposition; https://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/icc_proceedings/vol9/iss1/25/

59. “In this main pit, he encountered a deposit of clean, apparently water-laid soil up to eleven feet thick. Evidence of the Flood was absent from several shafts and uncertain or disturbed in a number of others. Just slightly before Woolley’s initial discovery, S. Langdon and L. Watelin encountered smaller flood levels at Kish (Watelin, 1934). Within a few years, excavations of a third Mesopotamian site, Shuruppak, also uncovered a flood stratum (Schmidt, 1931). It is of particular interest because, according to the Mesopotamian legend, Shuruppak was the home of Ziusudra, the Sumerian Noah.” For more details, see C/E Journal, Spring 1988; https://ncse.ngo/flood-mesopotamian-archaeological-evidence

60. In the video titled “Is There Evidence of an Ancient Flood?” by the Smithsonian Channel, various experts discuss geological and archaeological evidence supporting the theory of an ancient flood that may have inspired the biblical story of Noah. The video explores sediment layers, ancient artifacts, and the implications of rising sea levels in the Black Sea region. For further details, see Smithsonian Channel. (2021).

61. The lowest elevation of the Richat Strucutre, which was inundated and possesses extensive salt flats as a result, is 1165 ft (Topographic-Map.com). The entire surrounding continent was clearly inundated for a long period of time – our ignorance of this is a condemning commentary upon archaeology.

69. Since the local mean sea level at various points around the globe can be 328 feet higher or lower than the ellipsoid model of the Earth used for GPS, this provides a run-span of 656 feet from lowest to highest sea level given any specific reorientation of the Earth’s geographic poles. If this is the case here, then 88% of that range was exhibited here, in terms of sea level rise. A bit on the extreme, but we also do not know the regional gravitational dynamics involved in such an orbital shift, so this magnitude of rise is not out of the question.
