### Noah's ark

According to the P tradition, the ark was 300 × 300 × 30 cubits and consisted of three storeys; it also states that the landing point of the ark after the waters subsided was Mount Ararat, in Urartu, which is now known as Armenia. This extremely mountainous country, to the east of Turkey, has an average elevation of nearly 1800 metres and Mount Ararat is, at its highest point, more than four kilometres above sea level. If this description is correct, the ark could only conceivably have been carried to such an elevation by the tsunami wave that was generated by the impact in the Indian Ocean (see Figure 4, here). It would have travelled up the Persian Gulf and North-westwards across the low-lying land of Mesopotamia. If we assume for the moment that there is some truth in this story, it suggests that the ark met the impact wave high up on the Zagros Mountains above the land later to be known as Sumer, and was carried in a straight line until the wave lost its power. We had wondered how anyone could launch a ship into an oncoming tsunami wave, but it could be possible if the wave had travelled over sufficient land to breakdown into a chaotic swirl. If the vessel had been built on a high mountain like this, the rising sea water might be moving vertically upwards, rather than rushing forward like a wall. It is therefore possible that a launch could be achieved in such circumstances, without the vessel necessarily being dashed to matchwood. To sum up, then, the height of the land and its alignment with the wave epicentre and the claimed final resting point of the ark do make sense.

### Flood mapping - carried to specific mountains

Greek flood myth of Deucalion mentions specific mountains.

The Indians of Oregon tell a story that the survivors of the Flood, surviving in a boat, came to rest on top of Mount Jefferson – the state’s second highest peak. They believe that all of their tribe alive today descend from these survivors.

In northern California, there is an old tradition telling of animals that were chased by the rising waters to the very top of Mount Shasta which stands at 14,162 feet (over 2.5 miles) above sea level. It says these animals are the ancestors of all animals in the world.
