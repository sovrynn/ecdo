Notes
Introduction
1. Book 4, which in some manuscripts and in the early printed editions
is presented as a single book, in fact contains the fragments of two separate,
incomplete books: the beginning of 4a and the end of 4b.
2. The main evidence for the original order is as follows: the archetype of
the manuscripts had the order 4b, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4a; some early manuscripts
number book 4b as the third book, book 5 as the fourth, and so on; and several
features of the preface to book 3 suggest that it was originally the first book.
Hence it appears that 3 and 4a were originally the first and second books, but
became physically detached and displaced after a manuscript broke in two,
resulting in the loss of parts of books 4a and 4b. See Codoñer Merino 1979,
xii–xxi; Hine 1981, 4–23; Gauly 2004, 53–67.
3. See 3.1.2; 3.26.1; 4a.1.1; 5.14.4; 1.15.4.
4. The surviving part of book 4b shows that clouds and rain had been
discussed in the lost first part.
5. In Stoicism, the “world” (kosmos, mundus) consists of the celestial sphere
with the fixed stars; the planets, sun, and moon circling below them; and the
earth at the center. The “universe” or “whole” also includes the infinite void
surrounding the world (SVF, 2.522–5). Seneca does not always observe this
distinction, for he can use the words world and universe as synonyms (2.4.2)
and can talk about the “whole world” (5.17.5).
6. In psychological contexts, however, I translate “spirits.”
7. On breath, see LS, 1.278, 280–89, 292–94; CCS, 134–36, 185–86. Different
Stoics emphasized its closeness to fire or to air, and Seneca is in the latter
camp. Again, he does not always observe the niceties of Stoic terminology, for
in 2.6–11 he sometimes uses “air” interchangeably with “breath.”
8. See SVF, 2.633–45; LS, 1.275–76, 319.
9. On ancient meteorology, see Taub 2003.
10. On the sources, see Hall 1977; Setaioli 1988, 375–452; Gross 1989.
11. In the Meteorologica and elsewhere, Aristotle characteristically begins
discussion of a new topic with consideration of the views of his predecessors;
see Freeland 1990.
12. Seneca’s expectations in book 7 were fulfilled by Newton, who first
explained the orbits of comets.
13. Book 7 refers several times to a comet that appeared in Nero’s reign:
this must be the one known to have appeared in 60 ce, and Seneca must have
193no t e s t o page s 1 1– 2 7
194
been writing book 7 before the appearance of another comet in 64, or else he
would surely have mentioned it. Book 6 opens with a description of a recent
earthquake in Campania, during the consulship of Regulus and Verginius,
that is, 63. However, Tacitus dates a major earthquake in Campania to 62.
There cannot have been two major earthquakes, for Seneca is emphatic that
Campania had never been seriously affected by earthquakes before the one he
records. So it seems that either Tacitus or Seneca is mistaken about the date.
The problem has been much debated, but in the translation I accept the view
that the consular date is interpolated in Seneca’s manuscripts. See Hine 2006,
68–72, with earlier bibliography.
14. See Hine 2006, 63–67. Some scholars, notably Gauly (2004), have ar-
gued that there is implicit criticism of the emperor elsewhere in the Natural
Questions, where Seneca attacks vices that later writers associate with Nero.
But it is difficult to be certain that such innuendo is present, and in any case it
is compatible with due praise being given to Nero elsewhere.
15. See LS, 1.232–33, 259–66.
16. See Berno 2003; Williams 2005a; 2005b; 2006; 2007.
17. On the power of the writing, see Hutchinson 1993, 128–31, 234–39,
284–87.
18. Of course we cannot assert this of books 4a and 4b, which are
incomplete.
19. Obeli († . . . †) enclose Latin that is incurably corrupt in the
manuscripts.
20. The second half of the book is lost in our manuscripts, but some indica-
tion of its contents may be found in John the Lydian; see pp. 63–64.
21. The first part of the book is lost in our manuscripts, but references in
the surviving later part show that clouds and rain had been discussed, and the
discussion of hail and snow is already in full swing when our texts begin.
Book 3 [originally Book 1]
The title of this book is supplied from 3.1.1. Angle brackets indicate an
editorial insertion.
1. It is uncertain who this poet is. He is now generally supposed to be the
Vagellius quoted at 6.2.9 (Vagellius frag. 2 Buechner = 2 Courtney), but earlier
guesses include Lucilius, Lucan, and Nero.
2. That is, after the destruction of Carthage by the Romans in 146 Bce.
3. That is, to study ethics.
4. That is, good and bad fortune.
5. That is, being prepared to die at any moment.
6. “Quirites” was the traditional title of the Roman people, still used in Sen-
eca’s days in formal contexts. Seneca contrasts Roman civic law with the law195
notes to pages 27 –33
of nature. The Stoics believed that the world is controlled by divine reason and
so conforms to universal laws (see, e.g., LS, 1:267, 327); in Seneca compare, for
example, 3.15.3; 3.16.4; 3.29.3; 1.praef.3; 2.35.2; see also Inwood 2005, 224–48.
7. The Stoics said that only the wise man is free; vice is a form of slavery.
See SVF 3.589–603 (cited by volume number and passage numbers).
8. That is, “Why am I exhausting myself with farming, or in public life?”
9. Some think this refers to what has been said above, not to what
follows.
10. That is, rivers, springs, lakes, and so forth, as opposed to “celestial” wa-
ters, that is, clouds, rain, snow, and so forth.
11. Ovid Met. 3.407. Seneca uses the quotation to represent the theory that
rivers come from underground via springs.
12. Virgil Aen. 1.245–6, from a passage referring to the River Timavus, near
Trieste, a very short but fast-flowing river whose waters were said in antiquity
to taste of salt. The quotation represents the theory that rivers ultimately get
their water from the sea.
13. Here and at 4a.praef.9 Seneca actually addresses Lucilius by his cogno-
men Iunior: his full name was Gaius Lucilius Iunior.
14. Lucilius Iunior frag. 4 Buechner = 4 Courtney. This fragment repre-
sents the theory that rivers can flow underground for part of their course, for
it alludes to the traditional belief that the River Alpheus went underground
near Elis in the Peloponnese and reappeared in the spring of Arethusa in
Syracuse in Sicily.
15. The Nile is the subject of book 4a.
16. In the manuscripts this sentence is the second sentence of chap. 2.1;
it was transferred here by Codoñer Merino. Rain water is “collected,” spring
water is regularly described as emerging from “veins” in the earth; see espe-
cially 3.15.
17. Here “breath” (see the introduction, on ‘The Natural Questions and Stoic
Physics’) is virtually equivalent to “wind.”
18. From the Presocratics onward, philosophers had speculated about
how one element can change into another. Aristotle discussed the matter in
De Generatione et Corruptione. For Stoic views, see LS, 1:280; 286–87; CCS,
135–36.
19. That is, earth and water both sink toward the center of the world, which
is one of the extremities of the world because it is the furthest point from the
outer heavens, the other extremity.
20. Theophrastus frag. 216 Fortenbaugh.
21. Cassander was king of Macedon from 316 to 297 Bce.
22. Greek philosopher of the early sixth century Bce.; see DK11A12.
23. Referring to the Stoic doctrine of ecpyrosis, in which the whole cosmos
is consumed in fire at the end of each cosmic cycle. See LS, 1:274–79.no t e s t o page s 3 3 –4 4
196
24. DK11A15.
25. Asterisks indicate that something is missing from the Latin text. Here
Seneca may have written something like “<it is not likely that the earth floats
on water,> and . . . ”
26. Seneca here uses the language of senatorial procedure.
27. Referring to igneous rocks formed from lava, but also to various miner-
als and precious stones (see, e.g., 3.25.12).
28. See 3.10.
29. An illness that (supposedly) produced bouts of intense fever every three
days.
30. Theophrastus frag. 217 Fortenbaugh.
31. In the expectation of inheriting the father’s wealth.
32. The text and interpretation of this sentence is very uncertain.
33. Ovid Met. 15.313–4. This and the two quotations of Ovid that follow are
all taken from the long speech on the topic of change delivered by Pythagoras
in Met. 15, from a section on remarkable rivers, lakes, and springs.
34. A volcanic ash that was quarried at Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli) and used
to make a concrete that sets under water.
35. The name of the lake is incurably corrupt in the manuscripts.
36. Ovid Met. 15.320–21.
37. Ovid Met. 15.329–31. Ovid wrote “the river of the Lyncestae,” a Mace-
donian tribe; Seneca, or maybe a scribe, got the name wrong.
38. A philosopher from Sicily, c. 492–432 Bce; see DK31A68.
39. Melas is Greek for “black.” The other river is the Cephisus.
40. Theophrastus frag. 218D Fortenbaugh.
41. The name of the river is missing from the manuscripts but supplied by
Gercke from Pliny HN 31.14.
42. Square brackets indicate words that are interpolated in the Latin
manuscripts.
43. Theophrastus frag. 206 Fortenbaugh.
44. “Rock-crystal” here refers to clear quartz.
45. In book 4a.
46. Theophrastus frag. 211D Fortenbaugh.
47. On the stars feeding on exhalations, see 2.5.
48. Ovid Met. 15.273–76 (with some changes of wording; e.g., the last word
in Ovid is not “waves” but “fields”). This is another passage from the speech of
Pythagoras (see above at 3.20.3).
49. See the quotation from Lucilius in 3.1.1 and the note there.
50. Virgil Ecl. 10.4–5. Arethusa is here treated as a nymph. Doris is a sea-
goddess.
51. On some issues Seneca admits only a single explanation: for instance,
body is a continuum, and not composed of atoms and void (see 2.6–7); and theBook 4a [originally Book 2]
1. Imperiosi (sumus), translated “we bully,” is related to imperium in (1) above,
translated as “governorship.”
2. Here and in what follows Seneca uses several metaphors from gladiato-
rial or military combat.
3. One branch of the manuscripts here adds “Perhaps he is attacked pre-
cisely because he is exposed.”
4. It is not certain which Plancus is meant: possibly Lucius Munatius
197

world is controlled by fate, not the product of chance (see, e.g., 1.praef.14–15).
But on some of the topics discussed in the Natural Questions he allows that
there may be multiple explanations, sometimes operating simultaneously,
sometimes separately on different occasions (see, e.g., 4b.8; 5.5.1). Epicurus and
Lucretius had insisted that multiple explanations were appropriate in physics;
see 6.20.5–7; LS, 1:92–93, 95–96.
52. This phrase, “According . . . think,” should perhaps be attached to the
end of the previous sentence. Papirius Fabianus, a declaimer and philosopher
active in Rome in the early imperial period, was one of Seneca’s teachers.
53. By people trying to make the acorns fall off.
54. Ovid Met. 2.264, where the context is very different, not a flood, but the
seas are being dried up as Phaethon flies the sun’s chariot too close to earth.
55. Ovid Met. 1.292. This and the following quotations are from Ovid’s
description of the mythical flood that destroyed all mankind except for Deu-
calion and his wife Pyrrha.
56. Ovid Met. 1.304.
57. Ovid Met. 1.285–88a; 289b–290; Seneca (or the manuscript tradition)
omits two half-lines.
58. Ovid Met. 1.272–73.
59. For the Stoics, aether (a Greek loan-word in Seneca) was the pur-
est form of fire, found in the heavens (whereas for Aristotle, it was a fifth
element).
60. See 3.13.1 on ecpyrosis.
61. Beros(s)us was a third-century Bce Babylonian who wrote in Greek
on Babylonian history. Belus here is a legendary early Babylonian, though the
name is originally a Greek form of the name of the god Bel or Baal.
62. That is, the planets.
63. The Stoics.
64. See 3.9.3–10.1.
65. Charybdis and Scylla were mythical sea-monsters, identified with a
whirlpool and a rock in the straits of Messina, between Italy and Sicily.
66. See 3.27.2.no t e s t o page s 5 3 – 5 7

Plancus, a prominent military and political figure in the late Republican and
Augustan period (consul in 42 Bce); or his son (consul in 13 Bce).
5. Probably Lucius Vitellius (consul in 34, 43, and 47 ce, father of the future
emperor Vitellius; probably died in the 50s); Tacitus says he became notorious
for “shameful flattery” (Ann. 6.32).
6. A friend of Seneca’s; an orator and prominent public figure (consul in 27
and 44 ce; died by 47; latterly married to Agrippina, mother of Nero).
7. A Cynic philosopher, Seneca’s contemporary and friend.
8. Annaeus Fidus and Apollonius are not otherwise known (but the name
Annaeus suggests perhaps a freedman of Seneca’s or someone in his family—
and Fidus, ironically in this context, means “faithful”). A Thracian was a gladi-
ator armed like a Thracian, with a small, round shield and curved sword.
9. See 3.1.1.
10. Seneca’s elder brother, Annaeus Novatus, later, after adoption, called
Lucius Iunius Gallio Annaeanus.
11. The official attendants of senior Roman magistrates.
12. Gaius, emperor 37–41 ce, had Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus,
legate of Upper Germany, executed on a charge of conspiracy in 39. Valeria
Messal(l)ina was wife of the emperor Claudius, until she was forced to sui-
cide in 48. Narcissus, a freedman of Claudius, was forced to suicide just after
Claudius’s death in 54.
13. That is, suicide.
14. Virgil Aen. 4.373 (where Dido is speaking to Aeneas about his betrayal
of her).
15. Ovid Met. 1.241–42 (where Jupiter is speaking about the wickedness of
the human race). Erinys is another name for Fury.
16. Menander frag. 931 Koerte. The original context of the passage of Me-
nander here referred to is unknown, though some attribute it to a comedy
called The Rustic (Agroikos). When Seneca says, “the poet has leaped onto
the stage like a rustic,” he probably means that the words spoken by a rustic
character sound as though they express the poet’s own feelings, but the pas-
sage is difficult.
17. A legal phrase describing the procedure for laying claim to something
that belongs to you.
18. The “best part of us” is the mind.
19. The first Punic war between Carthage and Rome (264–41 Bce) was
fought mainly for control of Sicily.
20. From 43 Bce onward, Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey the Great,
controlled Sicily with a navy and fought off attacks by the members of the sec-
ond triumvirate, Antony, Octavian, and Lepidus, until his defeat at the battle
of Naulochus in 36. Caesar here is Octavian, the later Augustus. Lepidus’s
forces deserted him and went over to Octavian.2

notes to pages 57 –62
21. An allusion to Sicily’s large-scale corn production, on which Rome
depended.
22. See 3.1.2; 3.26.1.
23. Unless “not” is inserted, Seneca flatly contradicts all the other ancient
evidence about the rising of the Nile, and his argument is inconsistent. The
Dog Star (Sirius) was generally said to rise in late July.
24. “My favorite poet” is probably Lucilius; it seems that the preceding
quotation is a deliberate alteration of what Lucilius wrote.
25. These words occur not in our texts of Ovid, but in Tibullus 1.7.26, a
passage about Egypt and the Nile; Seneca’s memory seems to have let him
down about the author.
26. Philae was near Aswan (the original island is now submerged), but here
Seneca confuses it with Meroe, much further south, where the Atbara flows
into the Nile.
27. In Greek this means “not to be trodden on.”
28. Or “in many nameless branches.”
29. Balbillus was prefect of Egypt from 55 to 59 ce. It is disputed whether
he was identical with Tiberius Claudius Balbillus, a prominent military and
political figure under Claudius, and with a Balbillus who wrote on astrology.
30. Theophrastus frag. 214B Fortenbaugh.
31. 42 and 41 Bce. Antony and Cleopatra both died in 30 Bce, the year after
the battle of Actium.
32. Callimachus frag. 44 Pfeiffer.
33. Greek philosopher of the fifth century Bce; see DK59A91.
34. Aeschylus Supp. 559, inc. fab. frag. 300.4–5 Radt; Sophocles, inc. fab. frag.
882 Radt; Euripides Hel. 3, Archelaus frag. 228.3–5 Nauck = 228.3–5 Kannicht.
35. The text and translation here are uncertain. With the above rendering,
there is the problem that the Cayster and Mount Tmolus are in Asia Minor,
and so not really “northerly.” This could be an oversight of Seneca’s, or there
could be corruption in the text.
36. Cf. DK11A16. See also 3.13.1.
37. Etesian (Greek for “annual”) winds were any regular, seasonal winds,
particularly north or northwesterly winds that blow in the Mediterranean
during summer.
38. Greek explorer and geographical writer of the sixth to fifth centuries
Bce. See FHG, 4:408 (cf. Jacoby, in RE 6:1509–11).
39. Euthymenes, despite Seneca’s objections below, was presumably speak-
ing of etesian winds that blew from the west or southwest, forcing more water
from the Atlantic down the Nile toward Egypt.
40. Seneca presupposes the widely held theory that the saltiness of the sea
is caused by the impurities left behind when the pure water is evaporated by
the sun.no t e s t o page s 62 – 6 8

2. Ovid Ars 1.475–76.
3. Lucretius 1.313. This is the only quotation from Lucretius in the Natural
Questions.
4. One may infer that Anaxagoras was ridiculed in the lost part of the book,
perhaps because of his assertion that snow is really black (see Harry M. Hine,
“Seneca and Anaxagoras on Snow,” Hermes 108, no. 4 [1980]: 503; Gross [1989],
195). See also 4a.2.17.
5. This was presumably said in the lost first part of the book.
6. Virgil G. 1.313 (“our” Virgil because he was a fellow Roman).
7. There was a Greek proverb that said “Run risks with a Carian” (i.e., in-
stead of taking risks yourself ). Many Carians were slaves or mercenaries.
8. Seneca quotes the Greek word, which means “hail-guards.”
9. It was a proverbial idea in Greek and Latin that the gods are susceptible
to gifts.

1. Virgil Ecl. 2.26.
2. The phrase “form of words,” formula, alludes to the legal use of the word
to describe the formal statement of the nature of the dispute drawn up by
the plaintiff and the defendant together with the judge. Slipshod drafting of
the formula might lead to one’s losing a case; likewise Seneca has treated the
definition of wind as something that needs careful drafting to avoid accusa-
tions of error.
3. DK68A93a. See also 4b.9.
4. It was said that certain flies were generated from fire; see, e.g., Aristotle
Hist. an. 5.19, 552b10 ff.
5. This sentence appears to be out of place. Codoñer Merino suggested
deleting it.
6. Meaning “produced in or from a bay.”
7. The Stoics adopted the much older idea that the heavenly bodies have
their fire constantly “fed” by exhalations from the earth, and regarded the
whole world as a rational animal; see LS, 1:274–79.
8. 5.8.2.
9. See 4a.2.22.
10. As it stands in the manuscripts, this statement that the etesians “do
not last” beyond the rising of the Dog Star (Sirius) conflicts with all the other
ancient evidence and with the logic of the passage (see next note). Seneca per-
haps wrote something like “and are still [or: are just as] strong beyond. . . . ”
11. A difficult sentence, but the sense seems to be that after the solstice,
when the sun is moving south along the ecliptic toward the equator (the re-
gion “where it is more directly overhead”), it is pushing air southward ahead
of it—air that constitutes the etesian winds—and pulling other air toward it
from the north. This pulling process is not explained, but compare 2.20.3 for a
similar process in a different context.
12. See 5.8. Seneca here reverts to discussing the encolpias.
13. See 4a.praef.10.
14. Meaning “from a cloud”; that is, a cloudburst.
15. That is, by thunder and lightning.
16. See 5.4.
17. Ovid Met. 1.388; but Seneca misquotes or misremembers the phrase and
takes it out of context, for Ovid wrote “obscure with dark hiding-places,” a
metaphorical description of the riddling words of an oracle.
18. See 6.12 ff.
19. Asclepiodotus’s views on scientific topics are known only from Sen-
eca, but he was very likely also the author of the extant Tactica, a treatise on
military tactics.no t e s t o page s 8 0 – 85
202
20. Most likely Philip II (382–336 Bce), king of Macedon and father of
Alexander the Great. See 3.praef.5.
21. “Their ruin”: that is, the earth above threatened to collapse on them; but
also a symbol of the moral ruin of greed.
22. Seneca here, and just below, draws on the idea, much exploited by an-
cient philosophers, that man alone of the animals stands upright, being de-
signed to look up to heaven, not down at the earth.
23. Roman tombstones regularly said “May the earth lie lightly on you” (sit
tibi terra leuis) or something similar.
24. That is, gold.
25. The constellation of the Plough, or Ursa Major, or the Great Bear; a
northern constellation, so used as a metonymy for the northern regions of
the earth.
26. Ovid Met. 1.61–66; part of Ovid’s description of the creation.
27. Virgil Aen. 1.85–86, from the description of the storm that wrecked
Aeneas’s fleet near Carthage. The African wind was southwesterly (see 5.16.5
below) but here does duty for the west wind.
28. M. Terentius Varro (116–27 Bce), public figure, scholar, and prolific
writer. His On Agriculture and part of his On the Latin Language survive, and
there are fragments of many other works.
29. That is, at the same point on the horizon in any given location.
30. In this chapter it seems best to transcribe the Latin and Greek names,
although elsewhere some of them have been translated (e.g., eurus as “east
wind,” auster as “south wind,” etc.).
31. The historian Livy (probably 59 Bce to 17 ce). Seneca refers to the battle
of Cannae in 216 Bce. In Livy’s account of it the wind is named twice (Livy
22.43.10; 46.9).
32. Seneca writes as though the winds occupied places at a Roman dining
table: the “most important” place is on the right (i.e., NNE); the lowest on
the left (NNW).
33. That is, “the Thracian wind.”
34. That is, grammatical cases.
35. The Greek word horizon means “separating” (i.e., separating the visible
hemisphere from the invisible). In this case Seneca is happy to use the Greek
loan-word rather than the Latin versions.
36. C. Marius (c. 157–87 BCE), a highly successful general, but also promi-
nent in the political violence and civil war of the early first century. Livy
wrote about him in book 80, which does not survive (see Per. 80; frag. 48
Weissenborn-Müller = 20 Jal).
37. That is, while still at sea or after we have landed.
38. Xerxes, who invaded Greece in 480 Bce. His forces were defeated at
Salamis and Plataea.Book 6 [originally Book 5]
1. See the introduction, note 13, for the argument that the names of the con-
suls of 63 ce have been interpolated, and the earthquake occurred in 62 ce.
2. Seneca returns to these phenomena below at 6.27–30.
3. The sudden collapse of old or badly constructed buildings was a regular
hazard in the Roman world; cf. 6.1.12; 2.59.3.
4. “Threats from heaven” is a Virgilian phrase for lightning (Aen. 6.113;
10.695); cf. 2.59.11.
5. Virgil Aen. 2.354, spoken by Aeneas to his men during the fall of Troy.
6. That is, we can choke to death on our own phlegm.
7. Vagellius frag. 1 Buechner = 1 Courtney. The poem of Vagellius does not
survive, but the quoted words may well have been spoken by Phaethon, when,
in the myth, he was pleading with his father, the Sun-god, to be allowed to
drive his chariot, despite the risks involved.
8. For Epicurus and Lucretius, the main reason for studying physics was to
free people from fears based on the false belief that the gods were the cause of
frightening natural phenomena; see LS, 1:155–57. In Seneca, see also 2.41–46.
9. These phenomena were all treated as prodigies in Roman religion. They
are discussed by Seneca in book 7 (“long-haired stars,” or comets) and book 1
(the other phenomena).
10. Cf. DK, 1:486.34–35. See also 3.13.1.
11. Seneca appears to confuse the Danube with the Tanais (Don), which
was generally regarded as dividing Europe from Asia. There is the same confu-
sion in one of Seneca’s tragedies, Troades 9. (Some regard “and forming . . . and
Asia” as an interpolation.)
12. It is debatable whether this paragraph should be punctuated as a con-
tinuation of the theory in the previous paragraph, or as Seneca’s own words.

42. In a Roman trial the witnesses were called at a late stage, after all the
advocates for the prosecution and defense had delivered their speeches; hence
“near the end.” Nothing in Plato’s surviving works corresponds closely to what
Seneca says, though there is some resemblance to Resp. 520c, 586a–b.

breath (pneuma, spiritus), which they need to give them coherence; see the
introduction.

24. Virgil Aen. 8.728; this line, from the description of the shield of Aeneas,
describes the river Araxes (modern Aras), a river in Armenia that was bridged
by Augustus.
25. The phrase as it stands, and as translated literally above, is highly prob-
lematic, and it is here regarded as an interpolation. Others think the phrase
gives the title of Asclepiodotus’s work, in corrupt form. On Asclepiodotus,
see 5.15.1.

31. Thera, or Santorini, and the smaller island of Therasia were remnants
of a large volcano in the southern Aegean. The recently formed island was
called Thia (modern Aspronisi). See also 2.26.4–6. “Sailors” is a conjecture; the
manuscripts have “as we watched,” but it is unlikely that Seneca claimed that
the eruption was widely observed.

8. Greek mathematician and astronomer of the third century Bce.
9. The Chaldaeans were a people of southern Mesopotamia, associated
particularly with astrology. Epigenes and Apollonius of Myndus are of un-
certain date, and most of what we know about them comes from this book by
Seneca. Here “horoscope” has the ancient sense: a prediction about a person’s
life based on the configuration of the stars and planets at the moment of
conception or birth.

“hairs” spreading out from the comet’s body; but text and interpretation are
uncertain.

otherwise known.
22. This passage is very obscure, and there seems to be something missing
here.
23. Demetrius I of Syria lived from 187–150 Bce, and the war between the
Achaean confederacy and Rome was in 146–145. The comet appeared in 147

34. Seneca runs through the principal philosophical theories about the
mind (or soul): the Stoics said that it was breath and a portion of god (see LS,
1:313–23); the view that it was a harmony was particularly associated with the
Pythagoreans (cf. DK44A23, 53.4); the Epicureans said it was the finest part of
the soul (see LS, 1:65–72); the view that it was incorporeal was particularly as-
sociated with Aristotle (cf. De an. 2.1, 412a27–28); Empedocles said it was blood
(DK31B105); and various Presocratic philosophers said it was heat (DK67A28,
68A102). See also CCS, 295–301.

Late manuscripts and editors supply various titles, such as “On Celestial
Fires.”
1. Hellenistic philosophers distinguished three branches of philosophy:
logic, ethics, and physics. Seneca here ignores logic, contrasting ethics and
physics—but he concentrates on theology, which in this scheme was one
branch of physics.
2. The Epicureans said that the gods take no notice of human beings; see
LS, 1:57–65.
3. The Stoics identified god with nature, providence, fate, and necessity; see
2.45.2; LS, 1:275, 323–33; CCS, 133–38, 153–78.
4. That is, philosophy.
5. The earth was commonly said to be the size of a dot or pinprick in rela-
tion to the entire universe, but Seneca is here thinking particularly of a famous
passage in Cicero’s Republic, the “Dream of Scipio,” where Scipio dreams that
he is taken up to the Milky Way and looks down at the Roman empire, which
seems to be the size of a pinprick (Cicero Rep. 6.16).
6. Seneca here speaks ironically, as though he is dictating where the bound-
aries should lie both between the Roman empire and its neighbors, and be-
tween provinces within the empire. The Dacians, north of the lower Danube,
the Parthians, east of the Euphrates, the Sarmatians, northwest of the upper
Danube, the Germans, east of the Rhine, and the Ethiopians, to the south of
Egypt, were all beyond the empire’s boundaries. The Haemus mountain range
in Seneca’s day separated the provinces of Thrace and Moesia, and the Pyr-
enees separated Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis, two of the Gallic provinces,
from the Spanish provinces (see 6.30.3).
7. Virgil Aen. 4.404, from a simile in which the Trojans are compared to
ants; the word narrow occurs in the next line of Virgil, as in Seneca.
8. That is “even if your kingdoms stretch from one side of the inhabited
world to the other.” The Greeks and Romans thought that the whole inhabited
landmass, including Europe, Asia and Africa, was surrounded on all sides by
the ocean.
9. That is, the mind observes the point on the horizon at which the star
rises, the highest point of its course across the sky, and the point on the hori-
zon at which it sets. The phrase “the highest part of its course” seems to be an
interpolated explanation of “zenith.”
10. Seneca is probably thinking of the journey eastward from Spain to
India (which involved crossing Egypt by land, from the Mediterranean to
the Red Sea). But in the Renaissance Columbus and others thought he was
talking about a voyage from Spain westward; see D. Clay, “Columbus’ Senecan
Prophecy,” American Journal of Philology 113, no. 4 (1992): 617–20.209
n o t e s t o pa g e s 1 3 8 –1 4 2
11. Saturn; see 7.27.4.
12. This sentence, which appears in some brief excerpts from the Natural
Questions in a ninth-century manuscript from the circle of Alcuin, may have
been known to Anselm and may have influenced the phrasing of his argu-
ments for the existence of god in the Proslogion. See Harry M. Hine, Classical
Quarterly 42, no. 2 (1992): 558–62, at 560–61, with bibliography.
13. Seneca is referring to the world.
14. Principally the Epicureans.
15. This section deals with meteors, commonly called shooting or falling
stars. An unusually large meteor is today called a fireball or bolide.
16. Aristotle Mete. 1.4 talks about “shooting stars and what are called
‘torches’ and ‘goats’ by some people” (341b3–4), and later says that the “goat”
gives off sparks as it burns (341b30–3); Seneca does not give these details.
17. The Kids were two stars (modern astronomy counts three) close to Capella
(“the She-Goat”) in the constellation Auriga. (Probably Seneca employs the
name in this familiar way; it has also been suggested that kids is another term
for a type of meteor, but that use of this word is not otherwise attested.)
18. The third Macedonian war, 171–168 Bce.
19. 14 ce. On the use of the word departure, see 7.17.2.
20. Sejanus, a powerful Praetorian prefect under Tiberius, was executed
for treason in 31 ce.
21. Germanicus, adopted son of Tiberius, died in 19 ce; it was widely be-
lieved that he was poisoned.
22. Seneca again discusses the issue of how some events can be signs of
others in 2.32–51, particularly 41–42.
23. See 7.4.3.
24. Virgil Aen. 5.528. Seneca is distinguishing normal meteors from larger
fireballs or bolides.
25. Aristotle Mete. 1.4, 341b6–10. Seneca gives a very brief and free account
of Aristotle’s ideas.
26. Sirius, in Canis Major.
27. St. Elmo’s fire, an electro-luminescent phenomenon.
28. Gylippus was a Spartan general during the Peloponnesian war with
Athens; he was sent to Syracuse, in Sicily, in 414 Bce.
29. This chapter deals with what in modern meteorology are still called
coronae (this Latin word is here translated “garlands,” to preserve the basic
meaning). Coronae are a series of concentric rings of different-colored light
formed round the sun or moon by diffraction of light in water droplets in the
atmosphere.
30. April or May, 44 Bce.
31. Note that the modern scientific term halo describes a different phenom-
enon from the ancient Greeks’ halo, which in modern terminology is a corona:no t e s t o page s 1 4 4 –15 4
210
haloes are single rings of light round the sun or moon, produced by refraction
in ice crystals in the upper atmosphere.
32. “They” could refer to the clouds, but more likely it refers to unnamed
writers who are said to “generate” the rainbow.
33. Ovid Met. 6.65–67.
34. See 1.12.1, 1.17.2–3 on the use of bowls of oil or pitch to observe the sun.
The thousand bowls are of course a rhetorical “thought experiment.”
35. Aristotle Mete. 3.4, 373a35–b28.
36. Heraclitus (DK22B3) and Epicurus (frag. 345 Usener) held this view.
37. Saturn, though its perceived motion is very slow, has to cover vast dis-
tances, so it moves very fast (see 7.27.4; 1.praef.13); there is a progression from
the sun to Saturn to the heavens. Parroni (2002) prints the conjecture omnes
for omnium, by A. Mele, giving a reference to the sun: “none of us sees its (sc.
the sun’s) motion, but we all know it is very fast.”
38. This clause is obscure: perhaps Seneca assumes (though he nowhere
states) that the sun, the observer, and the cloud need to be in a straight line (or,
more precisely, on the same vertical plane) for a rainbow to be visible.
39. Aristotle does give a geometrical account of the formation of the rain-
bow (Mete. 3.5).
40. That is, proofs that are accessible to everybody: in Roman law there
was a difference between the raised platform (tribunal) on which magistrates
and legal experts sat and acted in an official capacity, and ground level, where
ordinary people stood. Seneca seems to have thought that Roman readers
could not cope with the geometry.
41. Artemidorus is of unknown date. He is usually identified with the Ar-
temidorus of book 7 (7.13), and outside Seneca is only encountered in a Byz-
antine astrological treatise (Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum 1.80,
5.204).
42. A line from a lost poem by Nero, describing the iridescence of the
feathers on a dove’s or pigeon’s neck (frag. 2 Buechner = 2 Courtney). The
Cytheran is Venus, who was associated with the Aegean island of Cythera.
43. Posidonius frag. 134 Edelstein-Kidd = 323 Theiler.
44. Virgil G. 1.380–81, from a passage describing various signs of rain; the
Greeks and Romans thought of rainbows as signs that rain was on the way (as
opposed to the biblical use of the rainbow as a sign that the rain is over). The
rainbow “drinking” was a traditional Roman idea.
45. The brief discussion of rainbows as weather signs in this paragraph
starts very suddenly and seems to interrupt the surrounding arguments about
the causes of rainbows. It does not fit very well at any other point in the book
either, so it may be an afterthought of Seneca’s inserted in an awkward place.
46. See 1.5.6.
47. See 1.2, on garlands. This short section, which poses questions without211
n o t e s t o pa g e s 1 5 4 –1 5 9
giving answers, reads like a brief note that is not developed or integrated into
the context.
48. Aristotle Mete. 3.5, 377a11–28.
49. “Rods,” nowadays called sun pillars, are not related to rainbows, but
are caused by reflection of sunlight from ice-crystals in the atmosphere. As
Seneca says, they appear next to the sun, not opposite it: a column of light
appears above the sun, usually when it is near the horizon; the color can vary,
but there are no spectral colors.
50. Already discussed in 1.2.
51. Seneca alludes to two possible explanations of the Greek compound
par-helion, “beside the sun,” or “equivalent to the sun.” The modern name is
parhelia (sing. parhelion), or sun dogs. They appear on either side of the sun
at an angle of about 22° from it, and are caused by ice crystals in the upper
atmosphere.
52. Virgil G. 2.95–96. But Seneca misquotes Virgil, who wrote not “by
what name” but “with what poetry,” that is, “How can I praise you highly
enough?”—which makes more sense of the second sentence quoted by Seneca.
Falernian was one of the best Italian wines; Rhaetian came from the Alps.
53. The final phrase of the sentence is incurably corrupt in the manuscripts:
there have been numerous conjectures, making Seneca say that the cloud re-
sembles the sun, or is close to the sun, or is capable of reflecting the sun, or
something similar.
54. See 1.11.2.
55. Aratus was a Greek poet of the fourth to third centuries Bce, whose
major work was the Phaenomena, a poem about the constellations and weather
signs. Parhelia are mentioned at lines 884–86. Aratus’s Stoicism is evident in
the poem, especially in its treatment of Zeus as the Stoic supreme deity. The
poem was very popular in Rome, and by Seneca’s time there were Latin ver-
sions by Varro of Atax, Cicero, and Germanicus.
56. In modern terms, this paragraph very likely brings together very diverse
phenomena: at the start, and in the following paragraph, are meteors and fire-
balls (already dealt with in 1.1), but “wells,” “jars,” and “chasms” could possibly
be comets (discussed in book 7), or novae, or supernovae, or displays of the
northern aurora (which is occasionally visible as far south as Italy).
57. Virgil G. 1.367. The same line is quoted (with slightly different word
order) at 7.20.1.
58. Greek sela means “lights,” “flames,” another term applied to meteors and
other bright objects in the sky.
59. In book 7.
60. See 1.5.14.
61. Criminals could be thrown to the wild beasts: the suggestion is that
Hostius is a wild beast himself. There may also be a suggestion of the mytho-no t e s t o page s 159 –1 6 7
212
logical Erysichthon, who, when punished by Ceres with insatiable hunger,
finally ate himself.
62. Virgil Ecl. 2.25–26, spoken by the shepherd Corydon. The second line
is quoted at 5.1.1 as well.
63. That is, other, more precious metals.
64. “Fragile” is puzzling; it suggests pottery (but pottery mirrors are not
attested) or glass (Parroni [2002] ad loc. refers to Pliny HN 36.193), though in
the context one might expect a cheaper metal to contrast with silver.
65. Dowries were handed back when there was a divorce.
66. The Latin is here corrupt, and the exact wording cannot be restored
with certainty, but again the reference is to the dowry given by the senate.
Book 2 [originally Book 8]
1. Seneca is probably thinking of the question whether the heavens rotate
while the earth stands still at the center of the universe (the usual view in
antiquity), or the heavens stand still while the earth rotates; see also 7.2.3.
2. Referring to the solstices: before the summer solstice, the sun ascends
higher in the sky each day; at the solstice it “turns back” and reaches a lower
height each day; the opposite happens at the winter solstice.
3. Ovid Met. 1.55.
4. “High up” represents the Greek meteora, the subject matter of meteorol-
ogy (see the introduction).
5. The Stoics and others sometimes regarded the earth as a living creature;
Seneca has developed the idea at 3.15 and 6.14.
6. “Matter” here covers both “subject matter” and “physical matter.”
7. On the Stoic theory of continuity and composite bodies, see LS, 1:170,
280–94.
8. See 5.8.1.
9. The atomists.
10. A reference to the water organ, which used a hydraulic system to main-
tain a constant air pressure.
11. The atomists again.
12. Seneca does not return to the topic in the surviving books; but in any
case, this is a standard kind of transitional formula that need not constitute
a firm promise to return to the topic. The theory of antiperistasis is found in
Plato (Ti. 79a5–80c8, where it is called periôsis), and may go back to the Pre-
socratics. Lucretius argued against it (1.370–97).
13. This is a brief statement of the argument for the existence of “self-moved
movers,” first found in Plato Phdr. 245c–246a, and Leg. 10, 894b ff.
14. Seneca could be drawing on the Stoic doctrine of “total blending,” krasis213
n o t e s t o pa g e s 1 6 7 –1 7 8
di’ olôn, the complete interpenetration of two substances in a mixture (see LS,
1:288–94); or he may simply regard walls and so on as porous to air.
15. See 2.1.1.
16. This refers to the motion of the planets, which, in the ancient geocentric
system, seemed to travel through the zodiac from west to east at the same time
as being carried round with the heavens and fixed stars from east to west.
17. Lightning-bolts, fulmina, are, in modern terms, cloud-to-ground light-
ning, and lightning-flashes, fulgura, are intracloud, or sheet lightning.
18. DK59A84. See 4a.2.17.
19. Aristotle Mete. 2.9, 369a10–14, 25–b11.
20. Two standard pieces of Roman artillery.
21. DK13A17. See 6.10.1.
22. Greek philosopher of the sixth century Bce; see DK12A23.
23. The process of “rushing together again” is not paralleled elsewhere in the
book. Perhaps it should be emended to “struggling” or “whirling.”
24. No philosopher of this name is known; the name has been variously
emended to “Anaximander,” or “Anaxagoras” (though both of these have al-
ready been mentioned in the book), or “Archelaus.”
25. DK64A16 = Diogenes T31b Laks. See 4a.2.28.
26. That is, forms a pointed flame.
27. Posidonius frag. 228, T41a Edelstein-Kidd = frag. 324, frag. 329, T21a
Theiler. Other sources date this eruption, which produced the island of Hiera
in the Santorini bay, to about 197 Bce.
28. In 46 ce.
29. See 5.15.1.
30. Inflated bladders were used as balls.
31. “Properly,” because the Latin word fragor, translated “crash,” is con-
nected with the verb frangere, “to break, burst.”
32. Cambyses was king of Persia from 530 to 522 Bce.
33. See 2.12.4.
34. See 2.26.1.
35. No other ancient writer alleges that lightning solidifies wine. Seneca
returns to the topic at 2.53.
36. It was commonly believed that after a lightning-bolt struck something,
it then flew back up into the air again, normally by a different path.
37. Seneca believes in the spontaneous generation of worms in corpses. The
phrase can refer both to the bodies of poisonous creatures and to corpses of
creatures killed by poison.
38. Seneca presumably refers to written oracles, which were notoriously
obscure.
39. On Stoic views of divination and fate, see LS, 1:232–33, 259–66.no t e s t o page s 1 7 8 –1 8 9

40. It was widely held among Stoics and others that god is not concerned
with the trivial details of the universe.
41. In Roman augury, omens were not valid unless formally acknowledged
by the appropriate person.
42. See 7.4.1.
43. Aspect, in astrology, is the angular relationship between planets or
constellations.
44. That is, the type of lightning. The interpretation of this word ( formula)
in the context is uncertain, as are the text and interpretation of the preceding
sentence.
45. Seneca refers to the Stoic doctrine of “co-fated” events, where both a
result and the cause of that result are fated. See LS, 1:339–40, 389.
46. Aulus Caecina, a public figure and writer of the late Republican period,
and a friend of Cicero’s. His family was of Etruscan origin.
47. The exact interpretation of these and some other technical terms of
Etruscan religion used by Seneca is uncertain.
48. Something is missing (e.g., “by enemies”).
49. This Latin word normally means “booty” or “the proceeds of selling
booty,” senses whose relevance to the kinds of lightning here distinguished is
not immediately apparent.
50. In Roman religion the twelve (chief ) gods were Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,
Minerva, Mars, Venus, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Vesta, Mercury, and Ceres.
51. Nothing more is known for certain about these deities.
52. Ovid Met. 3.305–7.
53. A reference to cult statues.
54. See 1.praef.3.
55. A Stoic philosopher in the early principate, one of Seneca’s philosophi-
cal mentors.
56. If the Latin word dentanea is correct, it is obscure, though it presum-
ably is related to dens, “tooth,” or “prong”; it should be perhaps be corrected to
ostentanea, “ostensible.”
57. The manuscripts have the unintelligible atertanea. Thulin suggested op-
ertanea, “concealed,” or “secret.”
58. The Latin is probably either imprecise or corrupt, for Seneca probably
refers to sacrifices used to call down lightning, and Jupiter with it.
59. See 2.31.1.
60. At the start of this chapter.
61. See 2.31.1 and note 35.
62. Posidonius frag. 135 Edelstein-Kidd = 325 Theiler. Although Seneca
has mentioned Posidonius earlier (2.26.4), he has not previously referred to
his views about thunder and lightning.
63. A philosopher of disputed date, either late fifth or fourth century Bce.215
n o t e s t o pa g e s 1 8 9 –1 9 2
Some identify him with the Atthidographer Clidemus. See DK62.1; FGH,
323F31.
64. Greek philosopher of the sixth to fifth centuries Bce; see DK,
1:492.6–8.
65. Fulgetrum (or the feminine fulgetra) is indeed found mainly in earlier
writers, as is fulgěre. Tonus is not otherwise attested in the sense “thunder”;
tonitrua was a more recent form, but Seneca is misleading in implying that
tonitrus was no longer in use, for he occasionally uses the form himself.
66. See 2.40.1–2.
67. In Roman religion there were rituals to be performed at any spot struck
by lightning, including sacrifices and the burial of the lightning-bolt (some-
times, perhaps, what we call a meteorite).
68. See 6.1.6.References
