The Alpha-Theta border area of around 8 Hz is recognized as the zone or the state of flow. This is the border between the conscious and the subconscious mind. In our sports performance, we start out with beta, but very quickly move into alpha and eventually theta. According to Sports Scientists, increases in Alpha Brain waves precede peak performance. And when you are in intense creativity, you are having a mystical theta-burst where you engage in deep dialogue with your divine mind and you’ll be surprised by your performance. This is the brain state of “being in the zone” where your work feels effortless.

The Alpha-Theta zone is also the brain zone where Gamma waves can occur. Gamma waves bind together ideas from distant ranging areas of our brain, connecting memories, experiences, and new stimuli into creative action.
Start with beta waves, move into alpha, then slowly lower to 8hz. 

With the beta ones, use them when learning new material or reading a book.
