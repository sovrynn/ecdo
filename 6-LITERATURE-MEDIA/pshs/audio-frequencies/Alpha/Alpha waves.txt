What alpha waves do:
    Relaxed Alertness: Alpha waves aren’t about zoning out. They foster a state of calm yet focused awareness. Imagine a seasoned meditator – present and collected, yet not tense. That’s the alpha zone.
    Stress Reduction: Alpha waves act as a natural antidote to stress. By promoting relaxation, they help lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and induce a sense of emotional well-being.
    Enhanced Creativity: When the mind isn’t bombarded by external stimuli or internal chatter, creativity flourishes. Alpha waves create a space for ideas to flow freely, fostering innovative problem-solving and out-of-the-box thinking.
    Bridge to the Subconscious: Alpha waves are believed to act as a bridge between your conscious and subconscious mind. This allows you to tap into your intuition and access deeper levels of insight that may be hidden beneath the surface in a Beta state.
    Visualization Powerhouse: The combination of relaxation and focus makes alpha waves ideal for visualization practices. In this state, you can create vivid mental pictures of your goals and intentions, which can enhance motivation and goal achievement.
    Meditation and Mindfulness: Activities like meditation and mindfulness training can help cultivate alpha wave activity. By focusing on the present moment and letting go of distractions, you can train your brain to spend more time in this beneficial state.

    How to Change: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness, or gentle yoga. Close your eyes and visualize peaceful scenes, or listen to music designed to induce Alpha states.
    Why: Alpha waves are linked with states of calm alertness and bridge the conscious and subconscious mind, enhancing creativity.
    When: Foster Alpha waves when looking to reduce stress, brainstorm, or tap into your creative reserves, perhaps when seeking innovative solutions or engaging in artistic activities.
    
    Alpha waves also help in conscious learning

Conscious learning is the process of learning in a state of total awareness, thinking about what you are learning, and trying to memorize and recall what you have learnt. It is also called Active Learning or Explicit Learning. Alpha waves create a stronger connection between conscious learning and unconscious learning.

When you are learning actively, there is the need for the brain to process and store the information easily. This method of processing and storing information by the brain is done unconsciously. In fact, only less than 20% of the processing activities of the brain is done on a conscious level. This is why alpha waves are extremely useful for studying.
Memory Retention

As much as alpha waves improve attention, they also improve assimilation and memory retention. After studying, a good way to assess the knowledge you have gained is by trying to remember what you have learnt. This comes easy when you study in the alpha brainwave state. Alpha waves help you learn, store the information and also make memory retention easy. Studies have shown an improvement in memory retention when alpha waves are produced.

Alpha waves are synonymous to relaxation. Thus, they are useful not just during studying but also after studying.
    
    Alpha State Characteristics:

    Relaxed Focus: The Alpha state is associated with relaxed alertness, mindfulness, and a calm, meditative state of mind.
    Reduced Anxiety: Being in Alpha reduces stress and anxiety levels, as it is linked to the brain’s resting state, which promotes feelings of calm and relaxation.
    Enhanced Creativity: Alpha waves facilitate more creative thinking and problem-solving because they allow for a freer flow of ideas, without the constraints of highly focused attention.
    Lowered Guard: In Alpha, the mental filters and barriers are lowered, allowing for less critical and more expansive thinking, reducing the impact of fear and limiting beliefs.
