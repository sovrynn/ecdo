<h2> Jupiter-Saturn Conjunction Series from 0 CE to 3000 CE </h2>
<h3> (You read correctly: 3000 Years!)</h3>
</center>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This page analyzes conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn over the 3000
year interval 0 CE to 3000 CE (occultation data from 10000 BCE to
10000 CE), and describes the reasons behind the
various patterns that are associated with these events. The long
time intervals are needed because these conjunctions occur rather
infrequently, and you need to track a lot of them to learn what is going
on. There is also a page specific to 
<a href="https://sparky.rice.edu/public-night/jupsat.html"> the conjunction of Dec 21, 2020</a>, if you
are looking for something more focused on that event. 
<p>
Saturn and Jupiter are two of the five planets visible to
the unaided eye in the night sky. Jupiter is particularly
bright, appearing as a brilliant point of white light in the sky,
while Saturn is a fainter dull white object, yet still
about as bright as a typical bright star.
Every 20 years or so Jupiter and Saturn align
(i.e. are in conjunction), and during those years these planets
can make a beautiful pair in the sky. Their relative motion during a
conjunction year is fun to watch, and provides an excellent way to learn
about planetary motions. This article covers the basics
of the Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions, and then goes into detail as to how the
different conjunctions relate to one another. The more you dive in
and ask more questions about the motions, the more complex the
answers become. Yet ultimately all of the behavior described here comes from
orbital motions of the Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Visibility</h2>
In terms of pure spectacle,
<a href="https://sparky.rice.edu/public-night/venjup.html">conjunctions between Venus and Jupiter</a> are
generally flashier than ones between Jupiter and Saturn.
While Jupiter is typically impressive in the night sky and
easily visible even in fairly bright twilight and in urban areas,
the same is not always true for Saturn. Both Jupiter and Saturn
are fainter when they appear close to the Sun than
they are when they are closest to us (and on the opposite side of the sky
from the Sun). Compared with their maximum brightnesses,
Jupiter drops by about a half when it appears close to the Sun
and Saturn by about a third. This brightness drop
is more of a problem for Saturn as it is always much fainter
than Jupiter, and can get lost in twilight glare. If the sky is
too bright to see Jupiter, you're not going to see Saturn.
As we shall see, many of the closest approaches of Jupiter and Saturn occur
either in the eastern skies at dawn or in the west at sunset.
Binoculars can help out a lot for viewing conjunctions in bright
twilight.
<p>
Nonetheless, conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn have a lot
going for them. Unlike conjunctions between any of the other
bright planets, Jupiter and Saturn typically remain within ten degrees of
one another in the sky for a period of a year or more around the actual
date of the conjunction, making for a long event that one can easily
monitor on a casual basis. Even if the conjunction itself happens to
be difficult to see because it occurs close to the Sun, the planets
will make an impressive pair in the night sky for months beforehand
and afterwards, meaning they can be observed together when they are closest
to us and appear their brightest, and are located in a fully dark sky
well above the horizon. There are also rare years that feature three
distinct conjunctions, all visible in the middle of the night. We
discuss how all this plays out below.
</p><p>
</p><h2>What is a Conjunction?</h2>
Simply put, a conjunction is when two objects line up in the sky. But that
alignment is never perfect, as the orbits for planets like Jupiter and Saturn 
are tilted slightly relative to one another, so what we really want 
to say is that a conjunction occurs when planets come close together and then
move apart. But how close together should count for a conjunction? We need a quantitative
definition.
<p>
Because the orbits of the planets all lie nearly in one
plane, a natural thing to do is to measure the angle (known as longitude)
to the position of the planet measured in the plane of the
Earth's orbit counterclockwise from some reference
direction. In the diagrams below, that reference direction is to the right, and
is where the Sun appears when viewed from the Earth on the first day of spring. With this
choice, the rightmost part of the orbit has longitude zero degrees, the top is
90 degrees, leftmost is 180 degrees, and bottom is 270 degrees. <i> If Jupiter and Saturn
have the same longitude as viewed from the Earth, we will call that a conjunction.</i>
Notice by this definition the planets may
approach one another, but until the longitudes overlap we don't count
it as a conjunction. For orbits in a plane, conjunction defined this way means
that the planets exactly align during conjunction, which is what we want.
As a technical point, the closest approach is called an appulse. But whenever 
two planets like Jupiter and Saturn pass one another they are moving along the plane,
so the closest approach (appulse) coincides with the longitudes being the
same (conjunction) to a high degree of accuracy.
</p><p>
Because the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn around the Sun
are both significantly larger than the size of the Earth's orbit,
the view of the planets from the Earth is similar to what you'd see
from from Sun. Hence, the time of conjunction as seen from the Earth is
quite similar to the moment where they have
the same longitude as viewed from the Sun, and we can use this fact
to help think about the problem.
Where the Earth is located in its orbit has crucial
consequences as to whether a conjunction can be observed, as the Earth's
position determines the time of year of the conjunction and also
its elongation from the Sun, but we can worry about those aspects once we get
the general cycles of the conjunctions figured out.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The Basics</h2>
Both Jupiter and Saturn are outer planets (outside the Earth's orbit).
Like all the planets including Earth, they orbit in a counter-clockwise
direction as viewed from a point far above the Earth's north pole. The
inner planets move fastest. Jupiter has an orbital period of <b>11.86 years</b>
and Saturn's period is <b>29.46 years</b>.
<p>
Suppose Jupiter and Saturn line up when viewed from the Sun (as in the figure below). How long
would it take for them to line up again? Jupiter takes 11.86 years = 4332.59 days
to orbit, and so on average moves 0.083092 degrees per day. 
Saturn moves around slower, at 0.033463 degrees per day. Thus, Jupiter is constantly
picking up 0.0496284 degrees on Saturn every day. After a time
(360/0.0496284) days = 7253.91 days = <b>19.86 years</b>, Jupiter will have
gained 360 degrees on Saturn and once again the planets will align as viewed from the Sun.
For this reason, Jupiter and Saturn conjunctions happen about once every 20 years.
You can break up your life into a few of these segments if you like, marking
time with this cosmic watch. A typical lifespan includes four conjunctions
of Jupiter and Saturn.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The 5:2 Jovian/Saturnian Orbital Resonance and the Six Different Conjunction Series</h2>
Let's look at this a bit more closely. If we start by aligning 
Jupiter and Saturn to the right of the Sun
(call it Conjunction 0 and define that as zero degrees),
then the next conjunction (call it Conjunction 1) as viewed from the Sun
will occur after 19.86 years and Saturn will have
moved (19.860/29.457)*360 = 242.7 degrees, while Jupiter has moved
(19.860/11.862)*360 = 602.7 = 242.7 + 360 degrees. Similarly, Conjunction number 2 now
occurs at 242.7 + 242.7 = 485.4 degrees = 125.4 degrees on the circles.
Finally, Conjunction 3 puts us at 125.4 + 242.7 = 368.1 = 8.15 degrees. 
Conjunction 6 is therefore at 16.3 degrees. This situation is shown in the following figure:
<p>
<img src="Jupiter-Saturn%20Conjunction%20Series_files/jupsat2.jpg">
</p><p>
<i>Diagram to scale of the orbits of the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. 
Initially, we align Jupiter and Saturn relative to the Sun at longitude = 0 in
an event denoted as 'Conjunction 0'. Subsequent conjunctions are labeled. Conjunctions
3 and 6 nearly line up with Conjunction 0.  The Earth moves slowly clockwise in its
orbit for successive conjunctions. For example, if the Earth (blue dot) is at position
0 for Conjunction 0, it will be at position 3 for Conjunction 3 and position 6 for
Conjunction 6.
</i>
</p><p>
<i>Notice after three conjunctions we are nearly back to the same position in the
orbits!</i> At that point Jupiter has gone around just over 5 times and Saturn just
over 2 times. We could have noticed this by dividing their mean motions
(0.083092/0.033463) = 2.483 ~ 2.5 = 5/2. So it isn't a perfect resonance, but
it is pretty close. Hence, we might expect conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn
to occur in distinct groups of three, and after three conjunctions we'd return
to about the same place in the figure. Hence,
grouping conjunctions into three series ensures that each conjunction
in that series occurs in the same general location in the sky.
Resonances of this sort are common occurrences in celestial mechanics, and cause
gaps and concentrations in many orbiting systems, such as Saturn's rings (resonances
with its moons) and the asteroid belt (resonances with Jupiter).
</p><p>
Although the above series of three is real, we forgot one detail - we are observing from the Earth
and not from the Sun. If you are on the bottom side of the Earth's orbit and Jupiter and Saturn
are off to the right (e.g., Conjunction 3), then Jupiter and Saturn 
will be visible in the morning sky before dawn, while if you are on
the other side of the Earth's orbit (e.g. Conjunction 6) the planets will be visible in the evening sky after sunset.
That is, after three conjunctions = 59.58 years, the Earth completes a bit more than 59-1/2 of its own
orbits, and so is nearly on the other side of its orbit from wherever it was three conjunctions ago.
So this isn't good - if we said that Conjunction 3 was in the same series as
Conjunction 6 then one event would evening, the next one morning, then evening, and so on
for adjacent events in the series.  Instead, if we break up the conjunctions into groups of
six, then after six conjunctions = 119.1608 years, Jupiter and Saturn
will now have moved 2*8.15 = 16.3 degrees ahead (counterclockwise)
as viewed from the Sun, while the Earth has
moved 0.1608*360 = 57.9 degrees, or about 2 months, also in the same direction.

<i>Animation of 120 years of the motions of the Earth (inner orbit), Jupiter
(middle orbit), and Saturn (outer orbit). The orbits are to scale. Conjunctions
of Jupiter and Saturn as viewed from the Sun are marked as C-0 through C-6.</i>
</p><p>
You'll notice that there will be slight differences between when Jupiter and Saturn
line up with the Sun and when they line up with the Earth. For example, in
the diagram, Conjunction 3 as viewed from the Sun occurs a bit earlier for
the Earth because the Earth is on the bottom half of its orbit, and from that vantage point
Jupiter has already passed Saturn when Jupiter and Saturn line up with the Sun.
Similarly, Conjunction 6 occurs a bit later for the Earth than it does for the Sun
because the Earth is on the top half of its orbit, where it does not appear
that Jupiter has passed Saturn quite yet.  These small positional offsets will
introduce some scatter, but on average we expect
the dates between successive conjunctions in a series (like Conjunction 0 and
Conjunction 6) to increase by about two months or so. Within a series,
a conjunction in May should be preceded by one 119 years ago in March and followed 
in 119 years by one in July. The longitudes should increase, but slowly, in a series. 
</p><p>
This is good: adjacent conjunctions within any one of the six series will generally occur at about
the same time of the year, and because the series were constructed to keep
adjacent conjunctions in the same part of
the sky, it means the planets will have roughly the same elongation from the
Sun between adjacent conjunctions within a given series. So it makes sense to
group the conjunctions into six separate series.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Opposition and Triplet Conjunctions</h2>
It is getting complicated so it is time to look at some data soon. But
first we need to recognize what can happen with outer planet conjunctions
when they are observed near opposition, when the Earth is situated on
a line between the planets and the Sun. These conjunctions should be the
best ones as they will visible in the middle of the night, and the planets
are also brighter because they are closer to us.
<p>
Take a look at the following diagram. Here we have an outer planet 
like Mars, Jupiter or Saturn being observed from the Earth. What matters
as far as an observer on Earth is concerned is the angle the planet appears
relative to the stars, indicated by the brown arrows.
In the diagram, we are taking the down direction to be zero degrees. At point
A, the planet appears at about -17 degrees. As the Earth moves from A to C,
that angle steadily increases to about +7 degrees. Increasing angles are to the
east in the sky. But between points C
and E the angle <i>decreases</i>, and so the planet now moves westward in the sky,
moving fastest at opposition (point D) when it appears opposite to the Sun in 
the sky. This westward movement is called <i>retrograde motion</i>. It happens
when the Earth is passing the planet and is similar to what
you see on the highway when you drive past a slower vehicle and that vehicle 
appears to move backward relative to the surrounding scenery. As far as north/south
is concerned, whether the
planet moves in either direction or even goes north and then south and makes a loop
depends on how the orbits are tilted. Here, I have the planet continuing to
go north in the bottom diagram. If the Earth and the planet were exactly in the same plane
the planet would simply shift east and west, and overwrite its path in the sky.
The Earth and the outer planets are fairly close to being in the same
plane, and so the motion is primarily left and right (east and west) on the sky.
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Jupiter-Saturn%20Conjunction%20Series_files/jupsat3.jpg" width="800">
</center>
<p>
<i>Retrograde motion occurs between points C and E in
this diagram. Opposition occurs at point D.</i>
</p><p>
Notice retrograde motion occurs only over a segment of the orbital
paths of the Earth and planet. This segment gets larger as the planet gets further away,
and approaches 180 degrees, i.e., the entire bottom half of the Earth's orbit
instead of just from C to E as in the diagram, for a very distant planet.
However, the amplitude of retrograde motion, i.e., the
distance between C and E on the sky, decreases for more distant planets.
For example, Saturn's retrograde motion typically covers about 6.6 degrees on the sky and
occurs over 141 days centered on opposition, while Jupiter retrogrades more,
9.9 degrees over a shorter interval, 123 days.  From one year to the
next (opposition to opposition), Saturn moves eastward about 12 degrees on the sky,
while Jupiter moves 30 degrees eastward. 
</p><p>
When the planets are aligned closely
enough with opposition to get triplet conjunctions, the first one of these will occur
before retrograde motion begins, and the third one will occur after retrograde motion
ends, with the middle one happening during retrograde. This is all made clear (hopefully!) in
the following animation and diagram.

<i>Longitudes of Jupiter and Saturn for a morning, triplet, and evening conjunction
from consecutive members of the conjunction years in Series 2. Longitude increases
to the east and decreases to the west. The planets move westward
(retrograde; down in the plot) around
the time of opposition. The vertical separation between the curves is the distance
between the planets in longitude, essentially equal to their separation in degrees 
on the sky. If the red curve is above the black one, Saturn 
is to the east of Jupiter, while if the black curve is above the red, then Saturn lies
to the west of Jupiter.</i>
</p><p>
Let's think about what happens as Jupiter passes Saturn by. Three scenarios from
consecutive members of series 2 are shown in the above figure. The
Aug 25, 1563 event was a morning-only conjunction. 
Jupiter caught up with Saturn and moved well past it before the planets
began to retrograde. By then Jupiter had gone too far ahead, and its
retrograde motion was not enough to catch up with Saturn again, so there
was only one conjunction, at longitude 125.3 degrees.
After 119 years in 1682-1683, the next conjunction in the series occurs
in roughly the same part of the sky at longitude 143.5 degrees,
about two months later in the year
in the morning of Oct 23, 1682. But this time the curve for Jupiter was shifted
just a bit to the west (lower longitudes) relative to Saturn than it was in 1563.
So this time Jupiter caught up with Saturn as they both moved westward during 
their retrograde motions and there was a 
conjunction on Feb 8, 1683, only a few days from opposition for
both planets.  After a month or two the planets again turned to the
east, and Jupiter passed Saturn for a third time, visible in the evening skies
on May 17, 1683. The next event in this series, 119 years later, was
on July 16, 1802. The steady progression of Jupiter's curve to lower
longitudes relative to Saturn's produced an evening-only event, as Jupiter did not catch up
to Saturn before retrograde.  In this way, conjunctions within a
series move from the morning sky, to a triplet near opposition, to the evening sky.
</p><p>
Conjunctions within a series typically move forward about 1 - 2  months
between successive events, and we see that here, as the morning conjunctions shifted
from Aug 25 to Oct 23 between 1563 and 1682, and the evening one moved from
May 17 to July 16 between 1683 and 1802. Triplet conjunctions are a bridge that
connect the morning events with the evening ones.
Triplet conjunctions are rather rare, as the oppositions need to line up
fairly well to get all three conjunctions, but they do happen regularly and
we should be on the lookout for them as we go forward.
</p><p>
As the above animation shows, the opposition that follows
a conjunction year does not produce
another conjunction (also no conjunctions occur in the preceding year)
For example, after the 1802 conjunction there was no conjunction 1803:
Jupiter needed to loop completely around the sky relative to Saturn before 
they lined up again about 20 years later in the morning of June 18, 1821.
However, that conjunction was part of a different series and occurred in
a different part of the sky from the one in 1802. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>Initial Predictions</h2>
With this setup of six conjunction series and considering triplet
conjunctions, we predict the following:
<ul>
<li> Individual conjunction events within a series will be separated
by 119 years and will move forward on average about two months each conjunction
until the triplet conjunctions occur.
</li><li> All series will have progressions where conjunctions aligned with the Sun
gradually move into the morning sky, then around midnight when a group of three
conjunctions (triplet) may occur together, and then finally the series moves to 
the evening sky before aligning once again with the Sun. The time for
a series to make this full progression should be about (360/(57.9-16.3))*119.16 ~ 1360 years.
</li><li> The location in the sky of each conjunction in a series should increase in longitude
by 16.3 degrees, making one full cycle relative to the stars every 2634 years. If instead
we use the convention of measuring longitude eastward from the vernal equinox for that year,
we have to keep in mind that the vernal equinox itself moves around once every 25772 years,
so longitude measured that way increases a little faster, 17.95 degrees each time
and the time to return to fixed longitude is then a bit shorter, 2390 years.
</li><li> Conjunction series 1 and 4, offset from one another by about 60 years,
should occur in roughly the same part of the sky,
but they will mirror one another in the sense that when one is in the morning, the
other is evening and vice-versa. Similarly when one has a conjunction aligned with the Sun,
the other will have a conjunction near opposition. Series 2 and 5 will have a similar
relationship relative to one another, as will series 3 and 6.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h2>How do these predictions stack up against real data?</h2>
<p>
The following table compiles
data for the conjunctions between 1200 CE and 2400 CE. The longitude (fixed, 2000 coordinates) shows
where the conjunction occurs on the sky. Note the longitudes are similar
every 60 years, with a slight forward drift, as expected. The separation between the planets
is next, and then comes the elongation in degrees from the Sun, with
negative being morning and positive being evening. The minus sign
changes every 60 years, as subsequent conjunctions switch from morning to evening
and back again, with exceptions when the series goes past the Sun or switches
from morning to evening as it passes through opposition.
These behavior we also expected. Then comes the series
number, and you'll notice it simply progresses 1-2-3-4-5-6 through the different
series except where there are triplets. Series 2 and 5 have similar longitudes, as 
expected, as do series 1 and 4 and series 3 and 6. The last columns show whether or not a
conjunction is particularly close, if it is easy to see, and
if there is a group of three associated with an opposition. A '?' means the
conjunction will be relatively easy to see at some latitudes, but not others.
All triplet conjunctions are easy to see because they are visible in the middle of the night.
After a triplet conjunction the series moves to the evening (positive elongations),
moves to align with the Sun (decreasing values) and then to the morning sky
(negative elongations), until once again getting close enough to opposition to
have a triplet conjunction. We anticipated all of this behavior.
The closest conjunctions occur in specific longitude ranges, and all conjunctions
are within 1.3 degrees. The section below on <a href="#sep">separations</a>
explains these aspects of the conjunctions.

As we noted above, triplets aren't too common. Within the 1200-year
interval tabulated above, there were 54 single conjunctions and 7
triplets. Some of the single conjunction events such as the ones
in 1265, 1385, 1821, and 2398 nearly had triplets.
Some plots of the six series may help clarify further:

<i>Locations in the sky (longitude for coordinate system 2000.0)
for all Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions from 0 CE to 3000 CE. X's are 
morning conjunctions and open squares are evening ones. Three symbols
on top of one-another indicate a triplet. Series 1 and 4 trace nearly
exactly the same longitudes, but alternate from morning to evening
between them, as do Series 2 and 5, and Series 3 and 6. All series
progress steadily to the east (higher longitudes) with time. 
</i>

</p><p>
So the predictions all held true, generally. All the series have a progression
from evening skies (positive elongation), to aligned with the Sun (zero elongation),
to morning events (negative elongations) and then usually one or two triplet
conjunctions visible in the middle of the night. Series 1 and 4 (and similarly
2 and 5, and 3 and 6) are related in
that they have similar longitudes, and when one is in the morning the other is
in the evening, and when one is near the Sun the other has a triplet opposition
conjunction. The graphs show that the time required for a cycle to move once around the sky is about
2600 years, exactly as predicted.
</p><p>
However, some features emerged here
we did not expect. We don't always get a triplet
conjunction in a series; for example, in Series 5 the single morning conjunction
on July 23, 1265 was followed by a single evening conjunction on April 8, 1385.
Both of these were close to being triplet conjunctions but the retrograde motion
just missed causing them. For example, after the July 23, 1265 event,
the planets approached to within about
68 arcminutes of one another on January 13, 1266 before separating again, but
this approach did not qualify as a conjunction because Jupiter never quite caught
up to Saturn in longitude.
On the other hand, sometimes we get more than one triplet conjunction back to back,
as happened in Series 1 in 1305/1306 and again in 1425.
The plots show that while the
average time between triplet conjunctions in a series may be around 1360 years,
the period seems to vary, and the shape isn't very periodic - it
is almost like it is dragged out in some places and compressed in others,
which explains why we might sometimes get no triplet conjunctions and sometimes
get two of them.  What might cause these variations?
</p><p>
</p><h2>The Orbits Aren't Circular</h2>
<p>
It's time to look at the orbital shapes in more detail. First of all, they are not
all in the same plane, something that affects mainly the separation distance,
as described in <a href="#sep">the next section</a>. But the orbits are also ellipses and
not circles. This detail matters a lot because planets move faster when they
are closer to the Sun. Astronomers use eccentricity (e) to define how oblate
an orbit appears, with e=0 being a perfect circle and e=1 opening so much it
never closes, making a parabola. For Jupiter, e=0.0484 and Saturn has e=0.0539.
These are actually relatively large. The Earth's eccentricity is lower by
a factor of three, e=0.0167 (though it does vary over very long timescales
and can get up to 0.068 or so, in the so-called Milankovitch cycles).
</p><p>
If the average radius of a circular orbit is R, then its
diameter would be 2R. For an ellipse, we define 2R to be long axis of
the ellipse, so R is half that, called the semimajor axis. The Sun is located off
the center of the ellipse, such that the closest approach of the planet to
the Sun, known as perihelion, is R*(1-e) and the farthest distance, known as aphelion, R*(1+e).
If the average orbital speed is v, then when e is small like it is here,
the planet moves at v(1+e) when closest, and v(1-e) when furthest away.
Let's redraw the orbit diagram we used above, indicating the locations of
perihelion with a 'p' and aphelion with an 'a', and add a longitude scale
while we are at it. The red arcs and the curly symbols have to do with the
tilt of the orbital plane, and we'll go over that in the next section.
</p><p>
<img src="Jupiter-Saturn%20Conjunction%20Series_files/jupsat2a.jpg">
</p><p>
<i>Orbits of the Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn to scale. The Earth's orbit is in
the plane. In the red halves of their orbits, Jupiter and Saturn are above the plane,
and the black halves they are below the plane. The Omega-shaped symbol is the
ascending node, where an orbit moves from below the plane to above it, and the
U-shaped symbol is its counterpart, the descending node where planets move below the
plane. The location where a planet is closest to the Sun on its elliptical orbit
is marked with a `p', and the location where it is furthest from the Sun is
marked `a'.  </i>
</p><p>
Jupiter and Saturn move most rapidly when they are close to
perihelion, at longitudes 14.8 degrees and 92.5 degrees, respectively.
After 10 Jupiter periods = 118.6 years, Jupiter returns to the
same place in its orbit. The eccentricity doesn't matter one way or
another for that to hold true. Now Saturn already returned to its
starting point after 4*29.46 yrs = 117.84 yrs and so has
had 0.76 years to move ahead in its orbit. If Jupiter's orbit were circular,
it would move ahead 9.8146 degrees, and catch up to Saturn at a rate of
0.0496284 degrees/day if Saturn's orbit were circular,
overtaking it in 197 days = 0.54144 yrs. This is how
we got 118.62 + 0.54 = 119.16 years between cycles.
</p><p>
But now suppose Saturn is near aphelion, around longitude l = 270. 
Jupiter is about halfway between aphelion and perihelion, so should
be moving near to its average speed. But Saturn's orbital motion is
now slower than average by a factor of (1-e) so it moves
ahead only (1-0.0539)*9.8146 = 9.28559 degrees, meaning that Jupiter
has less far to go to catch Saturn. Moreover, the rate Jupiter gains on Saturn
is faster because Saturn is going slower than 
average: 0.083092-(1-0.0539)*0.033463 = 0.05143 degrees/day, assuming Jupiter
is going its normal speed. So it now takes 9.28559/0.05143 = 181 days, or 16 days less
time than usual for Jupiter to catch up with Saturn. Hence, the Earth
is about 16 degrees back of where it would be if the planets were moving at their
average speeds. If the Earth would normally be, say, at l = 240 degrees it is
now at 225 degrees or so. But this offset also shifts the conjunction a bit
earlier because now Jupiter appears just ahead of Saturn as seen from the Earth. Combining these
effects it is possible for the dates between adjacent conjunctions in a series
to advance as slowly as two weeks in this part of the Jupiter/Saturn orbital diagram. 
The effect is largest when Saturn is at aphelion and Jupiter at perihelion,
around l = 330 degrees. Conversely, a conjunction series will move quickly
when Saturn is at perihelion and Jupiter at aphelion, around l = 150 degrees.
</p><p>
The position of the Jupiter/Saturn
conjunction doesn't change a whole lot from the eccentricity effects, but
the delays and speed-ups make a difference as to where the Earth is in
its orbit, and therefore how the series appears from Earth. The eccentricity
effect is evident in the plots, where the series seem drawn out for longitudes
between 270 degrees and 360 degrees, and compressed when the longitude
is between 90 degrees and 180 degrees. For example, Series 1 moves very 
rapidly from a conjunction located close to the Sun in 351 CE through
the morning sky to a triplet
conjunction at opposition in 710 CE, back through the evening sky to
a conjunction near the Sun again by 1068 CE and onward to triplet conjunctions 
at opposition in
1306 CE and 1425 CE. So the Cycle has moved Sun-&gt;opposition-&gt;Sun-&gt;opposition in
only nine conjunctions (1074 years). The average longitude in this period is 116 degrees.
But after 1425 CE, Series 1 gets stalled in the evening sky and takes twelve
conjunctions (1429 years) to finish just one leg, opposition-&gt;Sun,
in 2854 CE.  The average longitude during this period is 322 degrees,
exactly where we expect eccentricity to make the series progress slowly.
</p><p>
Triplet conjunctions occur when the oppositions of
Jupiter and Saturn are within about 1.7 days of one another. If a Series moves
quickly then the conjunctions may be sparse enough to miss that window so
that no conjunctions occur, as noted above for Series 5 that went directly from
a single morning conjunction in 1265 to a single evening one in 1385. Likewise,
if the elongation and timing are right, it is possible to have a Series
contain back to back triplets. Although it did not occur in the interval from
0 CE to 3000 CE, in principle it should be possible to get 
three triplets in a row in a series. It almost happened during the late
Roman Empire in Series 6, where there were triplets in 333 CE and 452 CE,
and very nearly a third one in 571 CE, missing a triplet on March 2, 571 by
less than a half degree in longitude.

<p>
If the elliptical orbits of Jupiter and Saturn were in the same plane,
then every time Jupiter moved in front of Saturn, their disks would
line up perfectly and Jupiter would occult (move in front of) Saturn.
However, orbits are never exactly in the same plane.
Astronomers describe the tilt of an orbit relative
to the plane of the Earth's orbit by two angles: (1) the 'inclination', i.e.,
the amount of the tilt, and (2) by 'longitude of the ascending node' where 
on the sky the orbit of the planet intersects the plane
of the Earth's orbit such that the planet
moves from below the Earth's orbital plane to above it.
In the above orbital diagram, the parts of the
orbits above the plane are shown in red, and below the plane in black.
The curly symbols represent the nodes, when the planet moves above
Earth's plane or below it.
As you might guess, you get a descending node
at a longitude 180 degrees away from the ascending node.
</p><p>
Saturn's orbital inclination relative to the Earth is 2.485 degrees,
and Jupiter's is 1.303 degrees. It is interesting that the ascending nodes of both
planets are similar, 100.6 degrees for Jupiter and 113.7 degrees for Saturn, so
that if Saturn is above or below the Earth's orbital plane, Jupiter usually is
as well (this is partly caused by the Earth's orbit being tilted relative to
all the large planets). Hence, in the diagram 
you can imagine both orbits tilting a bit above
the plane on the left side (longitudes 100.6-280.6 for Jupiter and 113.7-293.7
for Saturn) and below the plane on the right side.
</p><p>
Because the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn align reasonably well, we expect that
no closest approach will ever be worse than about 2.485 - 1.303 ~ 1.2 degrees,
the difference in the inclinations of the two planets.
Indeed, between 0 CE and 3000 CE the maximum conjunction
distance, i.e., the 'worst' ones, were 1.3 degrees in 1306 and again in 1940. Both
years featured triplet conjunctions at opposition, so the proximity of the Earth
to Jupiter and Saturn accentuated the inclination differences. Conjunctions in
both years occurred when the planets were tilted most out of the plane: longitude
206 degrees (therefore above the plane) in 1306, and longitude
39 degrees (therefore below the plane) in 1940.
Jupiter/Saturn conjunctions are good that way, always within 1.3 degrees of
one another in the sky.
</p><p>
What about closest approaches? As seen from the Sun, the orbits of Jupiter
and Saturn intersect at longitudes 127.4 degrees and 307.4 degrees. These
locations will have the closest conjunctions. The observed longitude
for closest approaches may vary by +/- 10 degrees or so from these two values depending
on where Earth is in its orbit, and as the conjunctions get wider, we will begin stray
from the optimal range.
</p><p>
Let's look at more data. The next table shows the closest conjunctions during the 3000 year interval:

Look at those longitudes! The pattern for closest approaches is clear: they
all have longitudes in two narrow ranges - between 119.6-144.9 degrees and 292.8-320.6 degrees -
close to the predicted optimal orbital intersections of 127.4 +/- 10 degrees
and 307.4 +/- 10 degrees.  Hence, there are specific locations in their
orbits where Jupiter and Saturn appear to overlap in the sky.
The 2020 and 2080 conjunctions are close because they line up with these
special points in the orbits. For the 2020 conjunction, Jupiter and Saturn
are around longitude 300 degrees, just below the Earth's orbital plane,
while the Earth is up at the top of its orbit at 90 degrees. The Earth
spins counterclockwise, so this case of the planets appearing to the left
of the Sun as viewed from the Earth means the conjunction is an evening event.
After three more conjunctions we get to 2080, where after two Saturn orbits
and five from Jupiter, the planets have moved about 8 degrees ahead to around 308
degrees. The Earth is now over at a longitude 175 degrees or so, and this vantage
point pushes the longitude of conjunction ahead a bit to 310 degrees. Now the planets
are visible to the right of the Sun, and so the 2080 event occurs in the morning sky.
<p>
The standouts in the table are the conjunctions of March 6, 372, and March 4, 1226.
Both easily visible in the morning sky, Jupiter and Saturn would have merged
into a single point of light for most people. The image below (again adapted from
Stellarium) shows what the 372 CE conjunction would have looked like in
a telescope. Though undoubtedly the conjunction was observed, no one ever
saw it like this because telescopes had not yet been invented in this time of
the Roman emperor Valentin I. Another favorite has to be the triplet sequence that
occurred in 1682 and 1683, where the three conjunctions were not only visible in
the middle of the night when skies were dark and the planets at their brightest,
but these conjunctions were also very close. These conjunctions happened only
73 years after the invention of the telescope, and not long after Huygens first
identified Saturn as having rings in 1655.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Occultations and the 854-Year Cycle</h2>
The disk of Jupiter never occults Saturn during the 3000 year interval of
this study. Even the 372 CE conjunction with its separation of 1.9 arcminutes
does not achieve the 0.4 arcminute separation required for an occultation. 
The apparent sizes of the disks of Jupiter
and Saturn are just really small, so it is very difficult to line them up perfectly.
In addition to the 372 CE event, there
was a nice triplet conjunction in 1793 BCE and the one on May 1 of that year had a separation
of only 1.3 arcminutes.
But to try to find a case for occultation, where Jupiter runs in front of Saturn,
we need to expand the time interval of the study. This actually begins to
get a bit tricky to do. While there are excellent predictions for the
positions of all the planets going forward or backward in time for several
thousand years, once we start looking at times before about 4000 BCE or
ahead of about 6000 CE the predictions begin to get more uncertain. There is
a recent compilation available from JPL, published in 2014, which gives
planetary ephemerides outside of this date range. I use these predictions
in this section, though it is good to recognize that there are 
uncertainties in the best of predictions, and the effect these have on the results
grows with distance into the future or past. 
<p>
Concentrating on the group of closest approaches (less than about 10 arcminutes)
an interesting aspect appears: the closest approaches concentrate into distinct
groups, where the members of each group are separated by nearly exactly
854 years. This grouping scheme removes the 80% or so of wide conjuctions and leaves
only the close ones, as shown in the following table.

(*) Occultation
</pre>

Look at the entries in the last grouping. We start on September 6
of -4414 (4415 BCE). Nearly exactly 854 years later, on August 12,
-3560, we have a conjunction with nearly the same longitude,
separation, and in the morning sky. The series gradually shifts
earlier in the year to May, in 854 year intervals. The May 4, -144 conjunction is a triplet
that includes Dec. 10, -145, and Oct. 18, -145, and another triplet
follows 854 years later with Sept. 13, 709 in the morning, Feb. 4, 710
in the middle of the night and March 30, 710 the last of the evening
ones. Starting from the morning triplet of Sept. 13, 709, we now
move ahead 854 years later on Aug. 25, 1563 with a single morning
conjunction, and continue every 854 years as the series moves
towards the Sun and the evening sky, and get triplets again in
7540/7541 CE and 8394/8395 CE. All the groups behave in a similar
manner. Notice how similar the longitudes are, and the regular
pattern for the series that goes ...1-2-3-4-5-6-1-2-3...
<p>
<i>So what causes the 854-year cycle/series for close approaches?</i>
Go back and look at the first diagram up at the top of the page
(the 5:2 resonance figure). Suppose conjunction 0 was a nearly
perfect alignment (remember the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn
are tilted out of the plane). Conjunction 3 almost gets us
back to Conjunction 0, but is off by 8.15 degrees. In the meantime, Conjunction 4
will occur a little to the right of Conjunction 1, Conjunction 7
a little more to the right and so on. Now, each synodic period
of 19.86055 years moves us 242.7359 degrees around the circle, so after 
n synodic periods the conjunction location is at n*242.7359
degrees. We only care where it ends up on the circle, not how
many times it goes around, so we want the remainder of
n*242.7359 to be as close to zero as possible. Likewise we
need the Earth to be in the same spot, so we want n synodic
periods to be equal to an integer number of years.
</p><p>
It is easy enough to loop through values of n and see
what might work. For example, n=3 leaves you 8.15 degrees
too far, or a fraction 0.023 = 8.15/360 of the circle ahead of where
you'd like to be. That isn't too bad, but n=3 corresponds
to 59.582 years, so you are 0.582 around the Earth's orbit
from where you want to be, and that's pretty bad. So we 
want n to bring both of these as close to 0 (or equivalently, 1,
which puts you in the same place because once around a circle
is the same as never moving).
</p><p>
Drumroll....  n=43 equals 19.86055*43 = 854.0036 Earth years, and
corresponds with 43*242.7359/360 = 28.993, or almost
exactly 29 revolutions. So after 43 synodic periods we return
to a nearly identical setup as Conjunction 0. Notice that 43 = 6*7 + 1, so
we go through series 1 through 6 seven times, with one left over.
This is why the series number always increases by 1 after 
854 years in the table. 
</p><p>
To the extent that the planetary positions are reliable, the
above table gives some interesting results. There are now
<b>four</b> occultations, one in the distant, prehistoric past on
6/1/-6856, and three in the far future (two in the same year!) on
2/16/7541, 6/17/7541, and 2/25/8674. The ones on 6/1/-6856 and
6/17/7541 are so well-aligned that the entire ball of Saturn
disappears behind Jupiter, leaving only the rings to poke out.
It looks like Jupiter has little handles or ears.  Unless you
have a scheme for living 5500 years, you'll have to be
content with the pictures on this one.

</p><h2>Though Occultations are Extremely Rare, There are Plenty of Pretty Alignments</h2>
Although there are no occultations between Jupiter and Saturn in the 0 CE and 3000 CE
interval, there are no shortages of beautiful alignments of the Jupiter/Saturn
pair with other celestial objects. Above is one I noticed from the next conjunction
in 2040/2041: a lovely alignment between Jupiter, Saturn, and the star Spica in
a near perfect isosceles triangle with the full Moon right in the middle.
<p>
</p><h2>Other Planets Can Join the Fun</h2>
In a conjunction year for Jupiter and Saturn, the two planets are always within
about 10 degrees of one-another in the sky. Over the course of the year they
move once around the sky relative to the Sun, and during that time they will always
go past Mercury and Venus, and usually Mars as well. So every conjunction year between
Jupiter and Saturn features groupings that involve other planets, and, of course, the
Moon, which moves around the sky once each month. Sometimes the conjunctions with 
other planets are impressive in their own right, though many are lost in the glare
of the Sun. One good one ocurred on December 5, 749, where only a few hours before
the closest approach of Jupiter and Saturn somehow Mercury managed to slip between them!
That event would have been hard, but perhaps not impossible to observe as
it was only 19 degrees from the Sun. In 2020, Mars passed within a degree of Jupiter
on March 20 and then Saturn on March 31, with the waning crescent Moon in the vicinity
on March 18. During this time Jupiter was about 7 degrees from Saturn. After the Jupiter/Saturn
conjunction as the planets emerged into the morning sky, there was a fairly close
conjunction of Jupiter with Mercury on March 5, 2021
at an elongation of about 27 degrees from the Sun, though
by then, Jupiter and Saturn were/will be about 8.5 degrees apart, and starting to look
less associated. Every conjunction year has things like this happening, so if you have
a Jupiter/Saturn conjunction year it is worthwhile looking to see what the other planets
are doing as well.  There is always something going on!
