# ORGANIZATION OF THE SOURCEBOOKS
- **Fossil clocks**: Bivalve growth rings and tree rings serve as indicators of various natural time periods, such as the length of months or years. Their utilization challenges standard geological interpretations of time.

- **Extinctions and overkill**: The fossil record often shows immense numbers of animals that seem to have perished within geologically short spans, suggesting possible catastrophic events. These extinctions raise questions about their causes, revealing that they may stem from rapid, catastrophic occurrences or other unknown factors correlated with the environment.

- **Mammoth graveyards**: These sites, particularly around the Arctic Ocean, feature extraordinarily thick deposits of muck containing abundant organic remains. This unusual concentration of remains invites exploration into the geological and environmental factors that may have contributed to such phenomena.

- **Animals in rocks**: Reports of frogs and toads trapped within rocks, sometimes still alive, highlight bizarre geological occurrences. These claims challenge conventional geological understanding and suggest that certain geological processes might preserve living organisms in unexpected ways.

- **Sealevel indicators**: Fossilized animal and plant remains serve as evidence for previously high sea levels. This anomaly provides insights into past climate conditions and supports discussions around historical geological events influencing biodiversity and habitat.
  
# SECTION EB: BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
- **Fish graveyards**: Vast numbers of fish fossilized in quick succession raise questions about the processes behind their preservation. Observations suggest that these occurrences likely relate to sudden and catastrophic events rather than slow, uniform gradualism.
# EBE-002 SUPERNOVAE AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS
- **Biological Damage from Radiation**: Early theories suggested that supernovae might cause biological extinctions due to radiation damage. However, calculations indicated that the radiation effects were actually too minimal to account for significant extinction events.

- **Climatic Effects from Nearby Supernovae**: The authors propose that a supernova explosion could have drastic climatic consequences, potentially leading to the extinction of many species, including dinosaurs. This hypothesis is supported by previous discussions on the radiation doses and their correlation with observed mass extinctions.

- **Detection of Supernovae Emissions**: The belief that high-energy cosmic rays and other forms of radiation are generated during supernova outbursts is bolstered by pulsar discoveries. These emissions could lead to significant changes in the atmosphere and impact life on Earth.

# EBE-003 EXTINCTIONS AND OVERKILL
- **Energy Deposition in the Atmosphere**: The effects of massive energy influx into the atmosphere could result in significant climatic instability and extreme storms. The energy levels involved are comparable to the gravitational binding energy of the upper atmosphere, leading to profound alterations in atmospheric circulation.

- **Long-Term Climatic Changes**: Increased ultraviolet emissions from the Sun could precipitate long-term changes such as ice ages and disrupted greenhouse effects due to ozone layer alterations. Such shifts may result in increased storminess and lower temperatures globally.

- **Other Potential Causes of Extinction**: The mechanisms leading to mass extinction may not be solely linked to supernovae; intense solar outbursts can also be critical factors. This hints at a broader understanding of climatic changes and their impacts on Earth's biota.

# EBE-004 THE GREAT EXTINCTIONS
- **Mass Extinction Events and Their Patterns**: Paleontological records reveal a cyclical pattern of sudden appearances and disappearances of life forms throughout Earth's history. Major extinction events coincide with the emergence of new life forms, suggesting a potential link to external factors like supernovae.

- **The Role of Cosmic Rays**: The theory suggesting that radiations from supernovae may invoke significant mutations and extinctions has sparked considerable debate among scientists. Critics argue that such radiative impacts could have occurred gradually rather than in a sudden event, which necessitates further investigation.

- **Unconformities in Stratigraphy**: Geologists note “unconformities,” where older rock layers show signs of erosion before newer sediments are deposited, indicative of significant time breaks in geological history. These unconformities raise questions about the relationship between ancient and more recent life forms, particularly during transitions between major eras.
# Chapter 1: Biologic Unconformity and Anomalies in Evolution

- **Anomaly of Animal Extinction and Emergence**  
  Whole groups of animal life vanished while new species suddenly appeared or proliferated rapidly. This raises the question of what external influences could have caused such drastic changes in biodiversity.

- **Disappearance of Dinosaurian Reptiles**  
  All types of dinosaurian reptiles including Mosasaurs went extinct, yet crocodilians, turtles, and the Tuatara survived. This anomaly prompts inquiry into the survival mechanisms of those that persisted through the cataclysmic events.

- **Sudden Appearance of Primitive Ungulates**  
  Vast herds of primitive ungulates seemingly emerged abruptly at the beginning of the Tertiary period. The record of only a few inches of sediment deposited during this time underscores a significant gap in our understanding of these developments.

# Chapter 2: Mammoth Graveyards and Catastrophism

- **Mammoth Carcasses as Evidence of Catastrophism**  
  Mammoths found in the Arctic Ocean's shores are key evidence suggesting that the Earth has experienced widespread catastrophism in recent history. Uniformitarians interpret these findings differently, leading to ongoing debates surrounding the historical interpretations of these events.

- **Contrasting Views of Howorth and Velikovsky**  
  Howorth's theories were more favorably received than Velikovsky's catastrophism, which resulted in significant upheaval in the 1950s. The discourse continues to evolve as new evidence and interpretations emerge.

# Chapter 3: The Mammoth and the Flood

- **Preservation of Mammoth Carcasses in Siberia**  
  The preservation state of the mammoth carcasses indicates they must have been frozen shortly after death. This preservation challenges the idea of a gradual environmental change leading to their entombment.

- **Existence of a Universal Deluge**  
  Howorth proposes that the extinction of megafauna, including mammoths, was due to a universal deluge affecting several regions worldwide. This theory seeks to explain the parallel found in the fossil records across different continents, marking the legacy of extensive catastrophic events.

- **Critique of Uniformitarianism**  
  Critics, including Howorth, argue that uniformitarian views often overlook potential catastrophic influences in geology. They stress the need for a broader investigation into geological phenomena that are not adequately explained by gradual processes.
# El-17 EBM-003 MAMMOTH GRAVEYARDS

- **Escape of Carcases from Decomposition**  
  The theory suggests that a flood of exceptional character could have carried mammoth bodies north, potentially burying them before they decomposed. If this occurred during the right season and temperature, the remains might evade rot and become entombed.

- **Inadequate Explanations for Catastrophes**  
  It is posited that while circumstances for a single catastrophe are comprehensible, explanations involving multiple catastrophes are considerably less so. The author finds the burden of proof rests on those who argue for numerous cataclysmic events regarding the mammoths.

- **Location of Mammoth Remains**  
  Evidence shows that mammoth remains are not commonly found in river deltas but are abundant in higher lands like tundra mounds. These locations are specifically supported by findings from Dr. Bunge's research, indicating a need for re-evaluation of where mammoth remains are discovered.

- **Nature of Siberian Geography**  
  Northern Siberia is characterized as a flat tundra rather than mountainous terrain, limiting the capacity for large-scale floods to occur and cover higher lands. The terrain's vast, frozen nature argues against the possibility of mammoths being floated and buried by river floods.

- **River Flood Limitations**  
  The passage states that while temporary floods do occur, they cannot cover the higher lands where many mammoth remains are found. The argument is that these floods would not provide enough water volume to inundate such areas and annihilate animal life.

- **Skeletal Positions**  
  Some mammoths are discovered standing upright and partially buried, suggesting rapid burial rather than slow sedimentation. The author claims that such positioning and preservation indicate that they were not simply washed downstream but buried more abruptly.

- **Continued Existence of Flora and Fauna**  
  The remains of trees found alongside mammoths suggest a different climate during their existence. The presence of freshwater shells and rooted trees suggests that the mammoths lived in a lush environment, contradicting the idea that they were merely floated and buried.

# El-19 EBM-004 MAMMOTH GRAVEYARDS

- **Mr. Howorth's Conclusions**  
  Howorth concludes that a significant catastrophe at the end of the mammoth period involved a universal flood that impacted a wide area. This flood not only led to the death of these mammals but also resulted in their subsequent burial under debris.

- **Biblical and Scientific Narratives**  
  Howorth presents the biblical deluge as one among many pieces of evidence supporting the occurrence of a universal flood. His arguments suggest that while the biblical narrative is significant, it should be considered alongside various scientific observations from around the globe.

- **Assessment of Mammoth Habitat**  
  The continuous presence of mammoth remains suggests they lived in Siberia, contradicting theories of their transportation post-mortem. Observations indicate a lack of waves on the bones and preservation in situ, supporting the idea they died where they were found.

- **Mixed Fauna in Deposits**  
  The findings include an array of animal remains, suggesting that different species lived contemporaneously but were simultaneously overwhelms by a flood. Howorth's hypothesis suggests that these animals, rather than co-existing peacefully, were trapped together by rushing waters.

- **Drowning Hypothesis**  
  Howorth uses examples of well-preserved remains, such as that of a rhinoceros found with blood vessels still intact, to support his drowning hypothesis. He argues that flooding could account for the preservation of remains in caves and fissures, which would not be possible through other means.

- **Cultural and Temporal Distinction in Human Species**  
  There exists a marked separation between the remains of Palaeolithic and Neolithic humans, with distinct cultural artifacts found within different contexts. The consistent absence of Pleistocene fauna alongside Neolithic tools strongly suggests that these two periods did not overlap in time or habitat.
# MAMMOTH GRAVEYARDS

- **Complete disappearance of one type of man and reappearance of another**  
  The phenomenon describes the complete absence of intermediate forms that would typically link two distinct types of man, fauna, and flora. This raises significant questions regarding the causes of such a sudden transition in the ecological landscape.

- **Immense flood as an explanation**  
  An immense flood has been proposed by M. Dupont to account for similar phenomena observed in various geographical regions. This theory suggests that sudden, catastrophic events could dramatically reshape ecosystems and lead to mass extinctions.

- **Survival of smaller mammals amidst the extinction of larger species**  
  While large mammals like the Glyptodon have become extinct, smaller creatures managed to survive. This disparity raises questions about the specific conditions or advantages that enabled smaller species to endure catastrophic environmental changes.

- **Disorganized collection of bones in New Zealand**  
  The discovery of mixed bones from different species in New Zealand suggests a general catastrophe that overwhelmed these creatures. This chaotic burial pattern points to a sudden and violent event that could alter ecological dynamics.

- **Unexplained cause of extinction for giant species**  
  Despite proposing various theories, Darwin ultimately concluded that no explanation sufficiently clarifies the extinction of large American mammals. This acknowledgment of unsolved mysteries reflects the complexities involved in understanding historical ecological shifts.

- **Landslip exposes a mammoth carcass**  
  A landslip along the River Beresowka revealed the head of a mammoth, allowing scavengers to attack it before an expedition preserved the remaining specimen. This scenario illustrates the delicate balance between discovery and preservation in paleontological contexts.

- **Mammoth suffocated due to entrapment**  
  Examination of a mammoth carcass revealed that it likely died from suffocation after falling into a crevasse. This detail provides insight into the physical struggles these creatures faced in their environment.

- **Different ecological conditions indicated by mammoth remains**  
  Stomach contents of woolly mammoths reveal an abundance of grasses and other plants that suggest a richer environment than what is found in modern tundras. This information supports theories of climate change and shifts in vegetation over time.

- **Historical representations of mammoths differ**  
  The woolly mammoth displays distinct anatomical features compared to modern elephants, including a notable topknot and a coat of long hair. These differences elucidate the adaptations necessary for survival in extreme cold climates.

- **Lack of comprehensive studies on frozen mammoths**  
  Despite the existence of various studies, comprehensive analyses focusing specifically on frozen mammoths are lacking. This gap in scientific literature complicates a full understanding of their ecological and evolutionary significance.
# El-27 EBM-006 MAMMOTH GRAVEYARDS

- **Frozen Mammoths Population**  
  The frozen mammoths were members of a populous race located in Siberia and not just occasional strays. Contrary to some popular beliefs, many were not found perfectly fresh and undamaged.

- **Marine Fossils Absence**  
  Marine fossils have never been discovered in the deposits containing frozen mammoths. This points to a lack of marine influence in the environments where these animals were preserved.

- **Age Confusion**  
  There has been significant debate regarding the age of frozen mammoths. Recent evidence suggests they existed in the last half of the Pleistocene epoch but has resulted in a complex dating situation.

- **Floral Changes**  
  The flora associated with various mammoth specimens indicates different climatic conditions. Some fossils point to slightly warmer climates, while others suggest conditions consistent with an interglacial period prior to the last glaciation.

- **Mammoth Location and Climate**  
  Almost all frozen mammoths were found in areas that experienced varying degrees of glaciation. The climate in which they thrived was likely warmer and moister than present-day conditions.

- **Anomalous Flora and Climate**  
  The flora associated with some mammoths was warmer-latitude flora, indicating climate discrepancies. For example, the climate appeared warmer than at present during the late glacial period in Siberia despite global cooling trends.

- **Unexpected Findings**  
  The Mamontova mammoth presents a paradox since it was found under glacial deposits but surrounded by warmer-associated flora. This suggests a warmer climate existed at some point during late glacial times.

- **Absence in Postglacial Deposits**  
  Despite extensive studies, mammoths are not found in postglacial deposits in Europe and North America. This poses further questions about their extinction timeline in relation to rising temperatures.

- **Death Causes**  
  Evidence suggests no catastrophic event led to the death and preservation of frozen mammoths as previously thought. The condition of the preserved cadavers indicates that they likely died from normal causes rather than sudden phenomena.

- **Asphyxia as a Mode of Death**  
  The examination of some specimens suggests asphyxia, either from drowning or being buried alive, was a more likely cause of death. This is supported by the robust condition of the cadavers and the preserved state of their flesh.

- **Specificity of Frozen Specimens**  
  Only mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses have been found frozen in Siberia, indicating a peculiarity in these species' physiology. This raises questions about their vulnerability in the environment compared to smaller fauna.

- **Foraging Habits Before Death**  
  Stomach contents and burial conditions imply that mammoths died in a warmer season when locomotion was difficult. This may have contributed to their entrapment and subsequent preservation.

# EBM-007 RIDDLE OF THE FROZEN GIANTS

- **Quick-Freezing Hypothesis**  
  Many woolly mammoths were found remarkably fresh, leading to the hypothesis that they were quick-frozen. The presence of flesh that appeared intact contradicts the idea they were killed by slow, natural processes.

- **Catastrophism Theories**  
  Sanderson speculated that a sudden drop in temperature, or even catastrophic weather events, could have led to the rapid freezing of mammoths. This raised questions about the methods of their demise and preservation.

- **Diversity of Specimen Conditions**  
  In Alaska, some mammoths were found mangled and still fresh, suggesting a violent death before freezing. Others showed signs of decomposition prior to being frozen, raising concerns about how many conditions existed in their burial environments.

# EBM-008 THE GLACIATED GRAVE OF THE MAMMOTH IN SIBERIA

- **Vast Graveyards**  
  Northeast Siberia is described as a graveyard filled with bones of various perished animals, indicating a major death event. This context suggests clustering of remains does not simply imply normal mortality but a significant environmental influence on the population.
# MAMMOTH GRAVEYARDS

- **Anomaly of Abundant Animal Bones**  
  The northern Siberia landscape is described as a vast graveyard abundant with the bones of extinct megafauna such as elephants and rhinoceroses. Although these bones are commonly found in diverse terrains, it remains a mystery how these massive animals perished in such quantities.

- **Frozen Elephants with Flesh Intact**  
  Some reports state that the bodies of elephants, perfectly preserved with flesh, fur, and hair, have been discovered standing upright in frozen cliffs. This phenomenon raises the question of how these animals were preserved for thousands of years and why they remain frozen in such a state.

- **Mammoth Bones Found on Various Islands**  
  Mammoth remains and tusks have been uncovered on numerous Arctic islands, suggesting a much different geographical and climatic past. This widespread distribution challenges current understandings of mammoth habitats and their ability to thrive in extreme environments.

# The Age Paradox
- **Paradox of Location**: Tektites are rarely found at their landing sites, a phenomenon attributed to their geological rarity and the dynamics of stream processes. Thus, the notion that tektites are not found in their original locations aligns with geological transport theories.

- **Distribution Patterns**: Tektites often accumulate in gravels due to their size and the influence of running water, making their occurrence in such locations understandable. This also contributes to their rarity in other geological contexts.

- **Cosmic-ray Evidence**: The absence of cosmic-ray interactions in tektite glass implies that they did not remain long in space before atmospheric entry. This suggests that tektites originated locally, rather than from distant celestial bodies.

# The Flight
- **Entry into Atmosphere**: Tecktites, shown to have fallen from the sky, demonstrated specific entry mechanics through aerodynamic experimentation. Testing revealed that these objects commonly entered the atmosphere at high speeds, particularly at low angles, with similar behaviors observed across different tektite types.

- **Pre-Atmospheric History**: Evidence suggests that tektites were not long in space, which limits their potential origins. Their size and mass indicate that they couldn't travel far without being affected by atmospheric conditions during their flight.

# Possibility of a Lunar Origin
- **Lunar Composition**: The compositional and morphological characteristics of tektites suggest a connection to the moon, particularly if they were formed in a vacuum. The presence of bubbles and lower water content compared to terrestrial glass further supports this hypothesis.

- **Transport Concerns**: One major objection to the lunar origin theory is the absence of a mechanism to keep tektite ejecta concentrated during their journey. While the Australasian field could potentially fit this category, the evidence suggests an extensive mixing that complicates the idea of a single lunar source.

- **Impact Theories**: Tektites could also originate from significant impacts on Earth, where a comet could create conditions that allowed for tektite formation in a brief explosion of material. Such a process could feasibly eject tektites into the atmosphere from a designated terrestrial impact site.

# Tektites and Craters
- **Moldavite-Crater Association**: The link between moldavites and the Nordlinger Ries crater has gained strength since both were dated at 14.8 million years. Distinct chemical compositions, however, may indicate separate origins of the glass and the moldavites despite their temporal correlation.

  As erosion affects the landscape, distinguishing between different types of thrusts becomes necessary. The Heart Mountain thrust showcases varying thrust behaviors, illustrating the complex interplay of geological movements over time.
# Structural Interpretation
- The "early basic breccia" is in contact with the Grove Creek formation in a manner that cannot be logically attributed to an erosion surface or a plane of intrusion. If this was a fault contact, it would be expected to show some fragments of volcanic rock, which have not been found.

- There is no clear mechanism for replacing the sedimentary strata above the Grove Creek formation with the "early basic breccia." The lack of fault contacts between the two units undercuts the assumption that they were faulted together, suggesting a more complex geological scenario.

# Anomalies in Fault Movement
- The presence of Madison limestone on top of Grove Creek suggests a fault contact where younger beds are thrust over older strata, contrary to the usual sequence. Explaining this unusual relationship becomes complex when considering the tight lateral contacts of fault blocks.

- The difficulty in visualizing how blocks of Madison limestone could be thrust into a position over Grove Creek raises questions about fault dynamics. The proposed theory suggests that younger rocks may slide down into gaps between fault blocks, complicating the understanding of stratigraphic relationships.

# Highland Overthrusts

# MOUNDS AND PIMPLED PLAINS

- **Anomaly 1**: The Mima-type mounds are inexplicably distributed along the Pacific Coast, coinciding only with the range of the pocket gopher. Notably, both the mounds and the gophers terminate abruptly near Puget Sound, raising questions about their origin.

- **Anomaly 2**: Burrowing animals similar to gophers, like ground squirrels and moles, inhabit many mound prairies, yet they do not contribute to mound formation. The absence of ground squirrels in western Washington and moles in most California mound prairies suggests that these species play no role in the creation of Mima-type mounds.

- **Anomaly 3**: Mima-type mounds only occur where there is a thin layer of workable soil atop a dense substratum, which varies in geological composition across locations. This difference implies that the formation mechanism of the mounds does not depend on a specific geological context.

- **Anomaly 4**: In deep sandy soil, gophers do not form Mima-type mounds, indicating that their burrowing habits do not lead to localized mounding if there are no substrate restrictions. For example, the ground near Olympia remains level despite long-term gopher activity.

- **Anomaly 5**: Geological deposition, a common mechanism for forming hillocks and mounds, cannot account for the Mima-type mounds due to their unoriented structure. Aerial photographs reveal a lack of directional alignment in Mima mounds, contrasting with the typical deposits seen with sedimentary processes.

- **Anomaly 6**: Erosion, typically resulting from environmental movement, cannot explain the Mima-type mounds either. The presence of a mossy turf on the mounds serves to protect them from erosive forces, creating stable, protected conditions that contradict erosion as a formative agent.

- **Anomaly 7**: The peculiar structure of Mima-type mounds includes unstratified fluffy soil alongside distinctly bedded substratum, which is an anomaly in geological terms. Additionally, features such as "mound roots" and a characteristic depression at the summits of the mounds add complexity to their formation.

This process reveals a synergy between vegetation and environmental elements that results in geomorphic changes.

- **Anomaly 11**: Mounds can develop significantly without the influence of any single species or external force, yet the action of wind and water erosion is omnipresent in shaping their form. The lack of vegetation in older mounds creates a distinct phase of decline after initial growth phases.

- **Anomaly 12**: Uneven erosion rates result in asymmetrical mound profiles, highlighting an imbalance in environmental forces acting during different phases of mound development. This variance can lead to perpetually maintained prominences while surrounding areas are worn down.

- **Anomaly 13**: Unique interactions between vegetation and hydrology impede drainage and allow for the perpetuation of mound structures, complicating the simplistic understanding of mound emergence. This finding indicates the need to consider multiple ecological factors converging to form distinct landforms. 

- **Anomaly 14**: The exclusive presence of these mound phenomena on the Pacific slope can be attributed to a unique combination of ecological and geological factors that rarely occur elsewhere. This spatial limitation raises further questions about the interplay of biotic and abiotic relationships needed to form such mounds.
