# Anomaly Evaluation   

- **Woodhenges**  
  With the exception of the single recognized American woodhenge, astronomy was probably not the main objective of woodhenges; most seem to have been supports for large roofed buildings of some sort. The American woodhenge, at Cahokia, Illinois, was apparently only a simple calendar site and is, therefore, not anomalous.

- **Suggestions of Trans-Atlantic Cultural Diffusion**  
  Despite some similarities between the American and British woodhenges, they are separated in time by up to 3 millennia and also in purpose. Therefore, they cannot be considered evidence for early cultural diffusion across the Atlantic.

# Possible Explanations   

- **None Required**

# Similar and Related Phenomena   

- **Stone circles (MSH7)**  
  Woodhenges may be older than stone circles—perhaps they were even their precursors. Most British woodhenges were simply buildings and not observatories, suggesting they are not anomalous in any respect.

# General Observations   

- **Astronomy and Woodhenge Structures**  
The axis of the original British Woodhenge was aligned with the summer Solstice, but the structure was not used for astronomy. Its posts probably supported a roof that precluded observations of the sky, indicating that it was a timber temple or meeting hall.

- **Wooden Structures in New World**  
The woodhenge at the American Cahokia site in Illinois was almost certainly devoted to astronomy, but it was basically a calendar site and not sophisticated enough to call anomalous. The great temporal gulf separating the Old World and New World woodhenges essentially bars any suspicions of trans-Atlantic influences. 

- **Independent Invention**  
Despite noted similarities between American Indian timber structures and those in Britain, this is likely a case of independent invention due to the time gap. The absence of anomalies across woodhenge structures removes the need for detailed analysis. 

# China Anomalies
