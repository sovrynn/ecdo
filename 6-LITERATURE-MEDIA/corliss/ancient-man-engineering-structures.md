# Runestones - Anomalies in Oklahoma's History 

- **Inscriptions Age and Origin**  
  One faction claims the inscriptions were made by Norse explorers around 900 years ago, suggesting a historical Viking presence in Oklahoma. In stark contrast, skeptics argue that some inscriptions could have been made within the past century, undermining their validity as evidence for Viking exploration.

- **Interpretation Disputes**  
  The runestones achieved notoriety as a controversy primarily due to differing interpretations regarding their ages and origins. This has created a polarized debate, with no room for compromise between those who advocate for the Viking narrative and those who dismiss it as forgeries.

- **Environmental and Geological Issues**  
  The stones were reported to consist of rocks common to the areas where they were found, but some contend they may have been transported from different geological regions. This raises questions about their authenticity and the conditions under which the inscriptions were made.

- **Quality of Inscriptions**  
  It is noted that when translated, the inscriptions made little to no sense in English, which complicates claims of their Norse origins. This can indicate either a lack of understanding by those who inscribed them, or that they were not produced by a literate Norse culture.

- **Cryptological Interpretations**  
  Proponents for the Viking origin of the inscriptions have employed cryptographic methods claiming the inscriptions contain hidden dates in a code used by Norse churches. However, the interpretation of these codes as significant is questioned, suggesting they might not provide credible evidence of an ancient Norse presence.

- **Geological Similarity of Stones**  
  The Heavener No. 2 and No. 3 inscriptions display formatting that significantly differs from the remaining runic inscriptions. This inconsistency leads to skepticism over whether a single runemaster could have created these inscriptions, supporting claims of varied origins.

- **Norse Influence from Native Cultures**  
  There is speculation that the Vikings may have borrowed runic symbols or motifs from Indigenous North American cultures. This raises the possibility that the visual language of the inscriptions could reflect a convergence of influences rather than a purely Norse origin.

- **Consistency of Weathering**  
  The stones purported to be of the same geological composition exhibited inconsistent weathering patterns, indicating they might not have been inscribed around the same time. This anomaly challenges the narrative of a singular Viking influx in the area, suggesting variability in the timing and method of inscription.
# Some Enigmas of Ancient Writing

- **Poteau inscription characteristics**
  The runes exhibit sharp lateral edges and high ridges from a metal tool, suggesting a recent crafting method. Furthermore, the interior color of the stone stays intact, contrasting with its weathered exterior.

  Observations of archaeological artifacts in Oklahoma highlight a significant difference in weathering patterns compared to the inscriptions. The findings emphasize that these newer inscriptions align minimally with the characteristics of ancient Norse relics.

- **Kensington stone vs. Scandinavian runic tradition**
  The Kensington inscription's forms do not fit the established Scandinavian linguistic continuum typical of its era. Scholars argue that its characters and language reflect a modern creation rather than an authentic medieval artifact.
# Some Enigmas of Ancient Writing

- **Invented Letters**  
  The Kensington Stone features the inventiveness attributed to its engraver, who created a j-rune that was not in use until the 16th century. This is significant, as it means that the stone, which is dated 1366, utilizes letters that were actually invented centuries later.

- **Anachronistic Language**  
  The presence of terms like "opdagelsesfaerd," which translates to "expedition," in the inscription raises questions about the linguistic capabilities of its creator. Such terminology would be impossible in the 14th century, suggesting the inscriber did not adhere to the historical context expected of their time.

- **Patina Misunderstandings**  
  There is a debate about the authenticity of the Kensington Stone, with some suggesting that an h carved in the stone by Holand only recently took on patina. However, findings confirm that the stone has remained sheltered from the elements, complicating claims regarding its age and authenticity.

- **Imperfect Copies**  
  A sketch of the Kensington Stone inscription, thought to be an accurate replica, turns out to be a rough draft rather than a copy, establishing a disconnection between the sketch and the stone itself. The discrepancies in spelling and character representation hint at the presence of a different engraving process altogether.

- **Undeciphered Indus Script**  
  The Indus script remains largely undeciphered, with linguists unable to establish its linguistic family or structure due to the brevity of established inscriptions. With surviving examples being too short for comprehensive analysis, the task of understanding this ancient language becomes increasingly daunting.

- **Problems with Chronology**  
  Although many Indus scripts are inscribed on various artifacts, the absence of a consistent chronological sequence complicates efforts to trace the evolution of the script. This undermines the ability to interpret symbols meaningfully, as a lack of context limits the understanding of their significance.

- **Limited Representation of Signs**  
  Indus inscriptions on objects such as seals and pottery show a limited range of signs that are often too few to draw significant conclusions about the language. The repetitive nature of the symbols across various contexts suggests an early-stage system that lacks the complexity needed for comprehensive linguistic analysis.

- **Easter Island and Indian Scripts**  
  Connections between the signs of the prehistoric Indian script and those found on Easter Island tablets suggest shared elements, yet definitive conclusions remain elusive. The idea of any specific ties or influences between these geographically distant cultures adds another layer of intrigue to the study of ancient writing.
# Some Enigmas of Ancient Writing

The tusks and bones found suggest a practical and cultural integration of elephants into their society, marking a notable aspect of their civilization.

# Anthropological Evidence
- **Blond Mandan Physical Traits**: Accounts from explorers in the 18th and 19th centuries noted the unusual physical traits of the Mandan Indians, including blondism and non-Indian features, leading to speculations of European ancestry. These observations highlight a compelling blend of cultural traits that seemed out of place in the northern Plains.

- **Mixed Descent Theories**: Theories regarding the mixed descent of the Mandan people arose, suggesting links with European nations through potential pre-Columbian contact. Explorers described the Mandan as tall and well-made, with a complexion that often appeared lighter than that of other tribes, reinforcing the idea of diverse ancestry.
# ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

- Anomaly of Dark Pigmentation in Mandans: The Mandan tribe exhibits a unique hereditary phenomenon of individuals possessing silvery-grey hair from childhood to old age, which suggests a genetic characteristic rather than a result of disease or habit. This observation was supported by both Lewis and Clark, who acknowledged the lighter pigmentation among some Mandan individuals as contrasting with the typical darker hues found in other Native American tribes.

- Unexplained Light Pigmentation: Some members of the Mandan tribe were recorded to have been noted as having fair complexions and light hair, suggesting a possible admixture with European genes. However, the absence of clear evidence for such admixture prior to the 18th century creates a paradox in understanding the origins of these traits.

- White Eskimos: Reports indicate the existence of a group described as "white Eskimos" near Coronation Gulf, claiming they descended from Norse colonists. However, skepticism surrounds these claims as their physical characteristics, such as having dark brown hair instead of the expected traits associated with Norse ancestry, cast doubt on their presumed European origins.

- Light-Skinned Natives in New Guinea: The discovery of a light-skinned tribe in New Guinea raises questions about their ancestry, suggesting possible links to ancient sea-faring white populations. Despite their light skin resembling that of Malays, they also exhibit distinct cultural practices that differ from surrounding indigenous groups.

- White Indians in Darien: The Tarifuroro of Darien present a case of an advanced indigenous culture reportedly exhibiting lighter skin tones compared to neighboring tribes. The findings suggest a complex history of intermixing and adaptation to their environment, prompting further interest in their ethnogenesis.

- Racial Variety Among Koreans: Koreans exhibit three distinct physical strains, with some showing similarities to white individuals, specifically in their lighter skin and variations in hair texture. These observations highlight an intricate interplay of genetic factors across the Korean population, influencing physical features in ways that may defy traditional classifications.
# Anthropological Evidence

- **Anomaly of Koreans and Albinism**: The anthropologists believe that the blonde strain found among Koreans is a distinct anomaly rather than typical albino characteristics. This is supported by Dr. Hrdlicka's suggestion that the physical traits observed may indicate a larger form of Asiatic origin in Korean ancestry.

- **Red Race of Madagascar**: Early navigators described an extinct red race in Madagascar characterized by tall stature, prominent noses, straight blonde hair, and reddish skin. This race shares physical features with the North American Indian, indicating a possible ancient connection that has since vanished.

- **Behavioral Misinterpretations of Native Children**: During inspections, the timid demeanor and behaviors of the children led to misleading conclusions about their mental capabilities.
