# Chapter 1: Coastal Plain Anomalies 
- **Linear magnetic highs**  
In some parts of the coastal plain area, linear magnetic highs are present. These usually trend in a northeast-southwest direction and tend to swell and diminish along the strike, complicating the magnetic readings.

- **Flat-elliptical bay borders**  
Many of the bays have a slightly flattened elliptical border on the southwest side. The reason for this variation may be due to the drifting of sand or possibly linked to the developmental processes of the bay itself.

- **Coarseness of rim sand**  
The rim sand of bays is generally coarser than the average sand in the area, as supported by various theories including the meteoric air-shock wave theory. This coarseness can be intensified by the actions of ants and the effects of wind on finer sand particles.

- **Lack of stratification in rim sand**  
The sand in the rim shows little to no stratification, and the underlying formations appear undisturbed. There is currently no verified evidence of disturbed ground beneath the bays, despite rumors of such features.

- **Absence of metallic and glass fragments**  
Metallic iron, basement rock fragments, or fused glass have not been found in association with Carolina Bays. The porous soil and climatic conditions contribute to the expectation that such materials would be absent.

- **Formation on Pleistocene terraces**  
All bays formed on the sandy Pleistocene terraces of the coastal plain and are younger than the well-developed beach ridges they intersect. Exceptions occur near the coast, where marine flooding has affected the sand rims.

- **Evidence of sea encroachment**  
There is direct evidence that the sea has encroached upon some bays and subsequently withdrawn, as seen in Blythe Bay, Wilmington, North Carolina. These processes have caused peat deposits to be covered by marine sediments.

- **Lake bottom springs**  
A few of the bays are known to have lake bottom springs located mostly near the southeast ends. These springs contribute to the overall hydrology and ecology of the bay systems.

- **Maximum peat thickness**  
The bays are generally filled with peat, reaching a thickness of 15 to 30 feet. This elevation of peat is determined by the surrounding water table, which affects the overall hydrological balance.

- **Presence of light-colored silt**  
Bottom samples from some bays reveal several feet of light-colored silt beneath the peat deposits. This sedimentary layer indicates that the bays were formed quickly and subsequently filled with water, leading to sedimentation.

# Chapter 2: Criticisms of the Meteor Theory 
- **Surface meteorites not found**  
No surface meteorites have been found associated with any of the bays, which raises questions about their meteoric origin. Critics argue that any surviving iron meteorites from 20,000 years ago would have disintegrated by now.

- **Undisturbed strata beneath rims**  
The strata beneath the rims of the bays remain undisturbed, suggesting that they were not formed by traditional impact structures. The response to this skepticism is that shock waves from the atmosphere would not disrupt deeper layers.

- **Size disparity in bay filling**  
It has been argued that smaller bays would have filled in more readily than larger ones, contradicting observations. However, the reverse is purported to be true based on evidence from various locations.

- **Aligned bays**  
Aligned bays, like those near Rains, South Carolina, are thought by some to be unlikely due to random meteorite distributions. The counterargument posits that such alignments can occur from meteorites striking a rotating earth.

- **Magnetic highs at bays**  
The magnetic highs recorded at the southeast rims of some bays seem to be too low to support a meteoric origin. Critics mention that these inconclusive magnetic highs do not correspond to the significant magnetic features located further south.

# Chapter 3: Other Theories of Origin 
- **Johnson's hypothesis of complex origin**  
D. Johnson proposed a complex origin for the bays, suggesting that artesian springs and groundwater solutions produced basins occupied by lakes, forming beach ridges and dunes. His hypothesis stands as a major critique against the meteoric theory.

- **Cooke's segmented hypothesis**  
C.W. Cooke theorized that segmented lagoons and crescent-shaped keys account for the bays' ellipticity, customized by gyroscopic action. This hypothesis integrates varying geological processes to explain the formations.

- **Grant's biological hypothesis**  
C. Grant posited that the bays were excavated by large shoals of spawning fish, conceptualizing a biological explanation for their origin. This theory diverges significantly from more geological or aeronautical explanations.

- **Kelly's tidal theory**  
A.O. Kelly theorized that strong tidal currents around stranded sea ice cakes could form the bays. His proposal suggests dynamic interactions between ocean tides and terrestrial features led to the bay formations.

- **Wind theories for bay formation**  
Several authors have proposed that wind plays a significant role in the shaping of the bays, either through wind scouring in arid conditions or via wind-driven water effects. These wind-driven theories offer an alternative perspective to the mainstream meteoric interpretations.

- **Bliley and Pettry's findings**  
D.J. Bliley and D.E. Pettry's study concluded that multiple periods of formation might account for the Carolina Bays’ features, suggesting wind and waves affected their development. Their evidence implies a complex interplay of environmental factors over time.

# Chapter 4: Comparisons with Other Features

Observations from Norway indicate the presence of distinct spiral lines on the walls of potholes, suggesting processes other than simple erosion.

- **Implications of large potholes for the moulin theory**: The moulin hypothesis—proposing that water cascading from an ice sheet forms potholes—encounters challenges when examining large depths found in extremely hard rock. Evidence from Pennsylvania showing a 45-foot deep pothole raises doubts about the feasibility of such a hypothesis.

- **Inclined potholes**: While most potholes are vertical, some reported instances reveal inclined potholes that must also be explained by the excavation mechanism. Observations from the Mokelumne River documented inclined features among a group of 250 potholes, suggesting variability in formation processes.

- **Unusual characteristics of groups of potholes**: Potholes often exist in groups, showing intriguing arrangements that challenge straightforward explanations. Analysis in Colorado identified multiple groups aligned along slopes and linking features that seem to contradict the expected random distribution of features formed by erosive processes.

  High-level terraces are identified along mountain sides far from major rivers and can span vast distances. Their heights indicate significant geological events, albeit lacking recent studies.

- **Anomaly Evaluation**  
Anomalies may dissipate if local factors can explain the existence of these terraces. However, if these features signify a global occurrence, they could indicate broader marine phenomena or geological movements.
# Anomalies 

- **High Level Terraces in Southeastern Ohio**: Professor J.J. Stevenson identified numerous high-level terraces in the upper Ohio river region that are nearly level and rise from 1100 to 2580 feet above sea level. These terraces lack a causal connection to the Cincinnati ice dam theory, yet they are well preserved and consist primarily of rock benches covered with sand.

- **"Parallel Roads" of Glen Roy in Scotland**: The parallel roads are horizontal and correspond directly in elevation on both sides of the glen. Early interpretations attributed their formation to ice dams during the Ice Ages, but this explanation faces various geological objections.

- **Terraces in Connecticut**: Connecticut features multiple terraces with elevations ranging from 280 to 1680 feet. These terraces exemplify a complex erosion record that indicates significant geological activity in the region.

- **Base-Leveled Surfaces in Massachusetts**: Geological studies in western Massachusetts uncovered remnants of four base-level surfaces at elevations of up to 2,840 feet. The evidence suggests a history of significant geological change over time in New England.

- **Piedmont Terraces in Maryland**: Maryland's Piedmont region contains terraces with heights between 520 and 745 feet, alongside water-worn pebbles and gravels. This illustrates the complex geological history and erosional processes that have shaped the region.

Lesley theorized about the implications of a substantial historical submergence on the terrace formations. The distribution of these terraces indicates widespread geological processes across multiple states.

- **Horizontal Beds in Chile**: In the Coquimbo valley, horizontal beds were found that resemble Glen Roy's parallel roads, formed from water-worn stones. These formations reflect natural processes that deposited materials at certain elevations along the valley.

- **Unsubstantiated Reports in the Andes**: Reports of marine beaches and a sea horse in Lake Titicaca are presented as evidence for a post-Pliocene uplift of the Andes, but scrutiny reveals these claims are largely unfounded. This raises questions about the reliability and interpretation of geological evidence associated with the region.

- **Erosion Surfaces in Tasmania**: Five major erosion surfaces have been identified in Tasmania, showcasing varying elevations from 800 to 4300 feet. These surfaces suggest a complex geological history influenced by both faulting and climate changes.

- **Concordances of Plainlands and Plateaus**: L.C. King proposed that widespread concordances in the elevations of plains and plateaus point towards a global geological process rather than isolated events. His assertion of pediplanation presents a perspective on the interconnected nature of Earth's geological history.

- **World-wide Pediplaned Surfaces**: King identifies significant similarities in the age and elevation of pre-Cretaceous and pre-Miocene geological surfaces globally. He indicates that continental drift and global forces likely contributed to the formation of these surfaces across vast regions.
# ETH1 Guyots and Plateaus 
- **Flat-Topped Seamounts (Guyots)**: These are truncated volcanic seamounts with flat tops currently found 1000-2000 meters below present sea level. They are mostly capped by Cretaceous sediments, and hundreds have been mapped in the Pacific, though rare in the Atlantic.

- **Anomaly Evaluation**: There is a prevalent belief among geologists that guyots were shaped by wave erosion, marking ancient sea levels. This interpretation suggests significant sea level changes beyond typical expectations for the Cretaceous period.

# ETH2 Anomalous Oceanic Plateaus 
- **Description**: Submerged plateaus are noted for their distinct morphology and seismic characteristics that set them apart from surrounding ocean floor topography. Some of these plateaus appear continental, while others seem to be of oceanic origin, with no consensus on how the latter formed.

- **Moving mountains (X4)**  
  The movement of Monte Arbino since 1888 has caused concern among local authorities, as the summit has shifted significantly to the east. Another mountain, Geleztas, in Transylvania, moved closer to the town of Monorokezek, leading to unusual proximity.

- **Salt mountains (X5)**  
  The salt mountains near the Virgin River in Nevada are notable for their purity and clarity. Their origins raise questions about how such structures, seemingly out of place, came to be classified among evaporites.
# ETL1 Land-Water Distribution Anomalies 
- **Supposed regularities in the earth's topography**: Various crystalline shapes have been proposed to represent the earth's structure. Some, such as de Hauslab's octahedron and de Beaumont's pentagonal dodecahedron, belong to a series of ideas that suggest an underlying geometric order. 

- **Green's tetrahedral theory**: In 1875, Lowthian Green posited that the earth takes the shape of a tetrahedron. He argued that four projecting points of this tetrahedron are aligned with the major land masses of the planet.

- **Regularities seen in tectonic plates**: A. Spilhaus explored new geometrical interpretations based on tectonic plates’ arrangements. His findings include azimuthal equidistant projections of an icosahedron that correspond with the major tectonic plates.

# ETL2 Island Arcs 
- **Features of island arc systems incompatible with plate tectonics**: Island arcs are often associated with multiple-arc structures and aseismic ocean basins, raising questions about the typical plate tectonic framework. Despite many observations supporting plate tectonics, certain phenomena appear to contradict established theories.

- **Island arcs where features that should have been subducted have not been**: The Lesser Antilles arc presents a case where geologists, like A.A. Meyerhoff and H.A. Meyerhoff, argue that certain geological features should be subducted but remain visible instead. This observation challenges the conventional understanding of subduction along this arc.

- **Missing sediments in subduction zones**: Many geological studies show significant sediment volumes are absent in trenches where subduction is expected. This discrepancy raises doubt about the validity of subduction as a geological process in many areas.

- **Apparent age decrease of oceanic crust as island arcs are approached**: According to predictions from plate tectonics, oceanic crust should age as it moves away from geological ridges. However, studies reveal that this age in some regions, such as the Aleutian Arc, appears to decrease instead.

- **Undeformed sediments in trenches of island arc systems**: Observations reveal that sediments in supposed subduction zones are often undeformed, contradicting the expectations of profound disturbance due to subduction. Such findings suggest alternative geological processes might be at play.

- **Directed structural features showing unexpected polarities**: Certain geological formations possess polarities that reflect the tectonic stresses, often contradicting predictions. Significant patterns on the earth's surface display features with unexpected orientations, challenging existing tectonic theories.

- **Nonexistence of subduction zones**: Many proponents of the expanding earth hypothesis question the reality of subduction zones as geological features. They argue that numerous tectonic phenomena cannot be accurately explained within the subduction framework, leading to skepticism about its role in continental formation and dynamics.
# ETL3 Large-Scale Patterns of Lineaments 
- **Terrestrial lineament systems**: Despite widespread recognition, there is no accepted explanation for terrestrial lineament systems. Their appearance across tectonic plate boundaries raises questions about their origin and relation to continental drift.

- **Global cracking**: An alternative hypothesis suggests that cracking could be due to core contraction or overall expansion of the Earth. This radical idea remains unproven, leaving the true significance of terrestrial lineament systems uncertain.

- **Spiral pattern in tectonics**: A fundamental spiral pattern encircling the Earth has been proposed, reflecting sinistral crustal movements. This pattern appears to influence geological processes, including island arc development, and may transgress some tectonic plate boundaries.

# ETL4 Measurements of the Relative Velocities of Continents 
- **Inconsistent relative velocities**: A report in 1983 indicated no relative motion between North America and Europe, which contradicted expectations from plate tectonics. However, subsequent measurements in 1987 detected relative velocities consistent with theoretical predictions, diminishing the earlier anomaly.

- **Early astronomical measurements**: Initial measurements of intercontinental distances were plagued with many sources of error and are now considered unreliable. The development of long baseline radio interferometers has improved accuracy but still struggles to detect small changes over vast distances.

# ETLS5 Geological Indications of an Expanding Earth 
- **Sea-floor spreading vs. subduction**: If sea-floor creation has outpaced subduction, it implies Earth expansion to accommodate the extra area. Studies indicate that over 165 million years, sea-floor spreading likely exceeded subduction by 33%, suggesting an increase in Earth's surface area.

- **Criticism of expansion data**: Measurements supporting the expanding Earth theory face intense scrutiny and criticisms regarding their precision. Despite this, the anomalies presented indicate that there may have been significant changes in Earth's size over geological time.
# ETL5 Indications of an Expanding Earth 

- **Paleomagnetic estimates of the earth's change of radius in geological time**  
  Paleomagnetic studies show an increase in the Earth's radius since the Carboniferous, aligning with some hypotheses of expansion. However, later research by McElhinny challenges this view, providing evidence that limits the possible expansion to less than 0.8%.

- **Negative evidence accumulates**  
  New palaeoradius estimates indicate no significant expansion, suggesting implications for Earth's expansion theories. Additionally, it asserts that other celestial bodies like the moon, Mars, and Mercury have not shown signs of expansion over time.

- **Carey's objections to paleomagnetic data**  
  S.W. Carey's criticisms of paleomagnetism suggest that it cannot accurately measure the Earth's paleoradii due to continental deformation. This ongoing debate creates uncertainty around the validity of paleomagnetic methods in supporting or denying Earth expansion.

- **Later paleomagnetic measurements**  
  Subsequent findings have indicated that during the Proterozoic, continental blocks exhibited common polar wandering paths, suggesting evidence of Earth expansion. This poses a challenge to existing explanations of continental movement during geological time, raising questions about how continents returned to their prior positions.

- **Traces of hot spots on the earth's surface**  
  Research involving hot spots indicates that Earth's radius was significantly smaller 120 million years ago. Stewart's analysis concludes that there could have been an increase in Earth’s radius of up to 12% over that time.

- **The paleogeographical approach**  
  Analyses of sea-covered continental areas from different geological ages suggest that declining average values could signify a shrinking Earth. Conversely, a constant level in sea coverage could imply that Earth’s volume has remained relatively unchanged over time.

- **Lack of evidence for an ancient oceanic crust**  
  Geochemical evidence indicates that no mantle-derived oceanic crust exists from the Proterozoic era. The global abundance of important geological indicators has dramatically decreased, suggesting the absence of ancient oceanic crust prior to a billion years ago.

- **General observations**  
  Observations indicate a close correlation between the rate of Earth's radius increase and Hubble's law for universal expansion. However, uncertainties about Hubble's constant raise questions about the reliability of this correlation in supporting expansion theories.

# ETL6 Continental Fits—Good and Bad 

- **Continental fits on a smaller earth**  
  Experiments suggest that continental fragments can fit together more accurately on a smaller Earth model than the current one. H.G. Owen's research supports this notion, indicating that a better fit of continental fragments occurs at an Earth diameter reduced by 20%.

- **The ubiquity of good "fits"**  
  The finding that many coastlines fit together raises skepticism regarding the validity of continental drift as a proof of past supercontinents. The arguments surrounding parallelism between coastlines hint at potential shifts related to tectonic systems rather than actual historical contact.

- **The badness of some "good fits"**  
  Many supposed compelling continental fits encounter significant inconsistencies, including overlaps and geological misfits. Critiques highlight discrepancies in the Bullard fit and the need to introduce complicated geological explanations that challenge the simplicity of continental drift models.

# ETL7 Topographical Anomalies and Continental Drift 

- **Topological impossibilities created by continental drift**  
  The hypothesis has given rise to regions that appear to have expanded contrary to expectations of compression. Furthermore, it raises issues concerning the amount of area available on the globe to account for past faunal and paleogeographical relationships.

- **Lack of subduction zones**  
  The failure to identify subduction zones where expected deformities in crustal sections should occur poses a significant challenge to continental drift theory. This absence suggests inconsistencies in the proposed mechanisms of crust recycling and movement.
# Anomaly Evaluation 

- **Anomaly 1: General observations**
  Certain continents have reportedly moved in ways that would seem incompatible with the concept of a present-sized Earth. The expanding Earth hypothesis is proposed as a potential resolution to this issue.

- **Anomaly 2: The Pacific perimeter paradox**
  The Pacific rim encompasses only a third of Earth's surface area, yet significant portions of it are said to have moved with Eurasia and Africa. This raises questions about the feasibility of such transformations, suggesting instead that a substantial expansion of the Earth may have occurred in the past.

- **Anomaly 3: The Arctic paradox**
  Fossil and paleomagnetic data indicate that since the Permian, the Arctic should have contracted due to converging continents. Contrary to this expectation, the Arctic region has been opening up, which could only be explained by an expanding Earth.

- **Anomaly 4: The India paradox**
  India has significant paleogeographical connections with several landmasses, presenting challenges for the continental drift theory to explain these links. The proximity demands among these regions cannot be satisfied on a smaller Earth, further supporting the expanding Earth theory.

- **Anomaly 5: The Africa paradox**
  Africa, surrounded by an ocean-floor-spreading rift zone, is theorized to have a sink that should account for a greater area than Africa itself. The paradox centers on the lack of expected subduction zones and sediments in various locations.

- **Mound Characteristics**: Gilgai soils typically exhibit circular and rectangular depressions, with mounds acting as the predominant topographical expression in certain regions. These features are documented extensively by geologists and soil scientists, particularly in Australia.

# ETM3 Mudlumps and Mud Islands 

- **Formation Theories**: Mudlumps and mud islands are believed to be extruded from plastic sediments under tectonic forces or subterranean gas pressures. Although this theory is appealing, it lacks direct observational support, questioning its validity.

- **Physical Characteristics**: Mudlumps can rise impressively to heights of up to 25 feet and discharge significant amounts of gas and saltwater. They are subject to erosion from currents and tides, which can diminish their presence over time.

# ETM4 Drumlin Anomalies 

- **Conflicting Theories**: Drumlins are commonly thought to be formed by glacial activity, yet their occurrence in both bedrock and drift in the same fields presents a challenge to this theory. Notably, glaciologists admit that explaining the formation of drumlins remains difficult, undermining their assumed proof of ice-sheet action.

- **Variations in Drumlin Shape**: Anomalies in drumlin shapes complicate our understanding of their formation, as both drift and bedrock drumlins exhibit similar morphologies. Questions also arise regarding the role of variations in pore water pressure and potential water-sculpting processes in their development.
# Drumlin Anomalies 

- **Drumlin associations with other geological features:** Remarkably straight and parallel ridges, interpreted as an elongated type of drumlin, trend southeasterly across an area of ground moraine in North Dakota. These drumlins are often accompanied by shallow grooves and arcuate recessional wash-board moraines.

- **Giant ripple marks:** A pattern of linear ridges, resembling giant ripple marks, is visible on the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, where they trend transversely to the axes of the drumlins. The significance of these ripples is that they are typically indicative of flowing water rather than ice.

- **Terrain slope:** An unusual uphill orientation of drumlins is observed in various regions, suggesting the flow of currents over hills and from the sea. For instance, in north central New York, the flow direction indicated movement uphill towards the Allegheny highlands.

- **Drumlin features incompatible with theory:** Certain drumlin characteristics contradict the existing glacial theory, such as the occurrence of both drift and bedrock drumlins in the same fields, which share similar forms and orientations. Additionally, the stratification patterns in many drumlins remain undisturbed, despite the expected effects of ice sheet weight.

- **Existing ice sheets do not form drumlins:** J.K. Charlesworth stated that modern glaciers do not produce drumlins in their nascent stages. Although some accumulations may resemble drumlins, the process of their formation by current glaciers remains unobserved.

# Missoula-Flood-Surface Mounds 

- **Description:** Small mounds, typically 2-4 feet high and 10-30 feet across, occur on basalt surfaces cleaned by the Missoula Flood. These mounds differ in nature and composition from the surrounding basalt and often appear in groups or lines.

- **Data Evaluation:** Studies of the mounds reveal several contradictions regarding their characteristics, such as the presence of underlying depressions and the composition of the mound material. This lack of consensus suggests that their origin remains somewhat anomalous.

- **Contradictory claims:** Observations by Freeman claim that mounds occur above depressions in the basalt surface, while others argue these mounds lie on flat or tilted surfaces without depressions. Additionally, discrepancies in the shapes of the mounds have led to differing hypotheses about their formation.

- **Recent field studies:** Recent observations confirm that the mounds are common on surfaces left bare by the Missoula Flood. They are typically described as fine silt mounds shaped like segments of ellipsoids, occurring above depressions in the base surfaces. 

# Fluid-Vent Mounds 

- **Description:** Mounds consisting of sand, mud, and other materials are formed by expelled liquids and gases. These mounds can vary significantly in height and often possess visible vents atop them.

- **Anomaly 4**: The presence of non-standard characters, such as "=" in "ETM1=R2", deviates from the expected numerical or alphabetical designation format. This could hinder reference identification and create ambiguity in citation.

# Chapter 3 

- **Anomaly 5**: Some author entries are shown with additional notes or identifiers, such as "ET V1-R55" closely following names. This overlapping of information can make it difficult to decipher which data points relate to specific authors without further clarification.

- **Anomaly 6**: There are multiple listings with sequences of numbers and letters that do not follow a recognizable pattern, for example, "ETM10-R2" and "ETM12-R14". Such disjointed sequences challenge the reader to establish a logical reference system. 

# Chapter 4 

- **Anomaly 7**: The inclusion of non-standard abbreviations or identifiers, such as "ETB1-R34", disrupts the flow of the text. Readers may struggle to understand what these identifiers signify compared to the standard citation styles typically used.

- **Anomaly 8**: Many entries include repeated identifiers such as "ETB1-R15" across different authors, indicating potential duplication or error in referencing. This raises questions about the credibility and accuracy of the information presented. 

# Chapter 5 

- **Anomaly 9**: There are unexplained gaps in the numeration of identifiers, which may suggest missing entries or an error in the compiled list. This irregularity could hinder users from understanding the complete context or reference hierarchy.

- **Anomaly 10**: The document mixes various types of data sources (journals, books, reports) without clearly distinguishing between them. This amalgamation can lead to confusion regarding the nature of references and their respective relevance to readers’ specific interests or needs.
# Origin of Submarine Canyons 

- **Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary Crater**: This anomaly refers to the impact events that are linked to mass extinctions, most notably the dinosaur extinction. The absence of transitional fossils before and after this boundary suggests a sudden catastrophic event.

- **Fluid-vent Craters**: These structures are unique geological formations that result from the expulsion of fluids from the Earth’s crust. Their presence indicates significant geological activity and provides insight into subsurface processes.

- **Great Bahama Submarine Canyon**: This canyon serves as a prime example of underwater erosion and geological processes at work. Its formation provides critical information regarding sediment deposition and the dynamics of ocean currents.

- **Mediterranean Submarine Canyons**: These canyons are characterized by their steep walls and complex formation history, often resulting from past sea-level changes. They play a significant role in the biodiversity and ecological processes of the Mediterranean Sea.

- **Paleomagnetism**: The study of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks helps to understand the movement of tectonic plates. It reveals information about continental drift and the ancient positions of landmasses.

- **Tunguska Event**: This historical event demonstrates the impact of asteroid or comet collisions on Earth. The absence of a crater and the extensive area affected suggest a large explosion in the atmosphere rather than surface impact.
