# ETB BAYS, LAKES, SMALL DEPRESSIONS
- **Large Groups of Oriented Lakes and Shallow Depressions**  
  These are large groups of shallow depressions oriented in common directions, often filled with water. The dimensions of these depressions vary, with some being as small as puddles while others expand to several miles across.

- **Anomalous Features of Potholes**  
  Potholes, commonly found in glaciated regions, are often assumed to be simple structures formed by water. However, some potholes exhibit features that defy traditional geological explanations, such as unusual shapes and internal fluting.

- **Fluid-Vent Craters and Fissures**  
  Fluid-vent craters and fissures present intriguing anomalies in geology, raising questions about their formation processes. These features may result from various geological activities, but their precise origins remain a topic of debate.

- **Gilgai Topography**  
  Gilgai topography consists of small, irregular depressions and mounds formed in clay-rich soils. The mechanisms behind the development of this topography challenge conventional ideas of soil formation and landscape dynamics.

- **Mountain-Top Depressions**  
  These depressions found at the tops of mountains seem to present a puzzle regarding their origins. Whether they result from erosional processes or other geological factors remains unclear and invites further investigation.

- **Depressions in Chalk Country**  
  Depressions found in chalk landscapes often present distinct geological features. The origins of these depressions—whether natural or influenced by human activity—remain subjects of investigation.
# Chapter 1: Coastal Plain Anomalies
- **Linear magnetic highs**  
In some parts of the coastal plain area, linear magnetic highs are present. These usually trend in a northeast-southwest direction and tend to swell and diminish along the strike, complicating the magnetic readings.

- **Flat-elliptical bay borders**  
Many of the bays have a slightly flattened elliptical border on the southwest side. The reason for this variation may be due to the drifting of sand or possibly linked to the developmental processes of the bay itself.

- **Coarseness of rim sand**  
The rim sand of bays is generally coarser than the average sand in the area, as supported by various theories including the meteoric air-shock wave theory. This coarseness can be intensified by the actions of ants and the effects of wind on finer sand particles.

- **Lack of stratification in rim sand**  
The sand in the rim shows little to no stratification, and the underlying formations appear undisturbed. There is currently no verified evidence of disturbed ground beneath the bays, despite rumors of such features.

- **Absence of metallic and glass fragments**  
Metallic iron, basement rock fragments, or fused glass have not been found in association with Carolina Bays. The porous soil and climatic conditions contribute to the expectation that such materials would be absent.

- **Formation on Pleistocene terraces**  
All bays formed on the sandy Pleistocene terraces of the coastal plain and are younger than the well-developed beach ridges they intersect. Exceptions occur near the coast, where marine flooding has affected the sand rims.

- **Evidence of sea encroachment**  
There is direct evidence that the sea has encroached upon some bays and subsequently withdrawn, as seen in Blythe Bay, Wilmington, North Carolina. These processes have caused peat deposits to be covered by marine sediments.

- **Lake bottom springs**  
A few of the bays are known to have lake bottom springs located mostly near the southeast ends. These springs contribute to the overall hydrology and ecology of the bay systems.

- **Maximum peat thickness**  
The bays are generally filled with peat, reaching a thickness of 15 to 30 feet. This elevation of peat is determined by the surrounding water table, which affects the overall hydrological balance.

- **Presence of light-colored silt**  
Bottom samples from some bays reveal several feet of light-colored silt beneath the peat deposits. This sedimentary layer indicates that the bays were formed quickly and subsequently filled with water, leading to sedimentation.

# Chapter 2: Criticisms of the Meteor Theory
- **Surface meteorites not found**  
No surface meteorites have been found associated with any of the bays, which raises questions about their meteoric origin. Critics argue that any surviving iron meteorites from 20,000 years ago would have disintegrated by now.

- **Undisturbed strata beneath rims**  
The strata beneath the rims of the bays remain undisturbed, suggesting that they were not formed by traditional impact structures. The response to this skepticism is that shock waves from the atmosphere would not disrupt deeper layers.

- **Size disparity in bay filling**  
It has been argued that smaller bays would have filled in more readily than larger ones, contradicting observations. However, the reverse is purported to be true based on evidence from various locations.

- **Aligned bays**  
Aligned bays, like those near Rains, South Carolina, are thought by some to be unlikely due to random meteorite distributions. The counterargument posits that such alignments can occur from meteorites striking a rotating earth.

- **Magnetic highs at bays**  
The magnetic highs recorded at the southeast rims of some bays seem to be too low to support a meteoric origin. Critics mention that these inconclusive magnetic highs do not correspond to the significant magnetic features located further south.

# Chapter 3: Other Theories of Origin
- **Johnson's hypothesis of complex origin**  
D. Johnson proposed a complex origin for the bays, suggesting that artesian springs and groundwater solutions produced basins occupied by lakes, forming beach ridges and dunes. His hypothesis stands as a major critique against the meteoric theory.

- **Cooke's segmented hypothesis**  
C.W. Cooke theorized that segmented lagoons and crescent-shaped keys account for the bays' ellipticity, customized by gyroscopic action. This hypothesis integrates varying geological processes to explain the formations.

- **Grant's biological hypothesis**  
C. Grant posited that the bays were excavated by large shoals of spawning fish, conceptualizing a biological explanation for their origin. This theory diverges significantly from more geological or aeronautical explanations.

- **Kelly's tidal theory**  
A.O. Kelly theorized that strong tidal currents around stranded sea ice cakes could form the bays. His proposal suggests dynamic interactions between ocean tides and terrestrial features led to the bay formations.

- **Wind theories for bay formation**  
Several authors have proposed that wind plays a significant role in the shaping of the bays, either through wind scouring in arid conditions or via wind-driven water effects. These wind-driven theories offer an alternative perspective to the mainstream meteoric interpretations.

- **Bliley and Pettry's findings**  
D.J. Bliley and D.E. Pettry's study concluded that multiple periods of formation might account for the Carolina Bays’ features, suggesting wind and waves affected their development. Their evidence implies a complex interplay of environmental factors over time.

# Chapter 4: Comparisons with Other Features
- **Alaskan oriented lakes**  
Similarities exist between the oriented lakes of northern Alaska and the Carolina Bays; however, no meteoric origin is considered for these lakes. The unique geologic conditions, including permafrost, play a crucial role in their formation.

- **Texas Panhandle lakes**  
The depressions in the Texas Panhandle show various classes, including circular and linear shapes. Original irregularities and solution processes may lead to the formation of these lakes, yet they differ from the expected mechanisms of bay development.

- **Kalahari salt pans**  
The ephemeral lakes in Botswana's Kalahari, formed through deflation, bear resemblance to the Carolina Bays, although meteoric origins are not discussed. The environmental and climatic conditions reflected in these pans portray a complex hydrology that mirrors bay formation.

- **Eastern New Mexico depressions**  
In eastern New Mexico, depressions vary significantly in size and depth, housing ephemeral lakes that depend on climatic variations. Judson's argument highlights the unique leaching and wind deflation processes responsible for their development.

- **Holland's bays**  
Similar formations to the Carolina Bays exist in the Netherlands, though their discovery is hindered by civilization. Von Drabbe's hypothesis of glacial origin for Dutch depressions contrasts sharply with prevailing theories regarding the Caroline Bays’ inception.

- **Playas of southwestern Australia**
