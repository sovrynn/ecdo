# Chapter 1: STRATIGRAPHIC ANOMALIES [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Cylinders, Boulders, and Inclusions in Strata**  
  Large boulders included in fine-grained sedimentary matrices challenge the standard beliefs in sedimentary formation processes. Their origins often raise questions, especially when they appear to have traveled significant distances, suggesting alternative transport mechanisms beyond the typical ice-rafting theory.

- **Cylindrical Structures in Sandstone**  
  The discovery of cylindrical structures in Paleozoic sandstones has sparked renewed interest due to their intriguing formation and appearance. The Patagonian structures, which lack published data, display peculiar characteristics that present a challenge to conventional explanations, raising further questions about their genesis.

- **Cylinders and Pipes in Strata**  
  These curious structures, also known as "pipes" or "pots," appear to disrupt the expected sedimentary patterns such as cross stratification. Their presence and the conditions surrounding their formation indicate a rapid geological process that diverges significantly from current sedimentary models.

- **Disintegration Process**  
  Rapid release of former high pressure may lead to disintegration. Uplift from the flood depths would decrease pressure on underlying rocks.

- **Cross Stratification**  
  Proposed that the pattern of cross stratification may result from a disintegration process. Features supporting this include the presence of polystrate pillars in cross stratified formations.

- **Polystrate Pillars**  
  The existence of polystrate pillars in cross stratified sandstone and drift suggests a non-sedimentary origin. They indicate that cross stratification may arise from pressure-related disintegration.

- **Drift Pillars**  
  Observations revealed pillars in cross stratified drift gravel at a site south of Kitchener, Ontario. These pillars varied in appearance, being stained and even exhibiting a concentric structure.

- **Pillar Composition**  
  Some pillars consisted of materials like sand and clay, showing resistance to weathering compared to the enclosing gravel. Distinct color banding and alignments of pebbles were noted in certain pillars.

- **Bent Stratification**  
  The pattern of cross stratification around some pillars showed a downward bend, indicating unusual geological activity. This bending may be linked to the pillars’ presence during the stratification process.

- **Comparison with Potholes**  
  Pillars in drift resemble potential geological structures described as "pots" in Maryland and Virginia. While their shapes differ, they share concentric structures and bent stratification closely resembling phenomena seen in potholes.

- **Pillars of Cross Stratified Contents**  
  Some pillars exhibit patterns of cross stratification internally, suggesting they are not products of sedimentary processes. Their existence within fine cross stratified sand raises questions about their formation in fast-flowing environments.

- **Whirlpool Theory**  
  A unique mechanism proposed for the formation of one sand pillar involves an erosive whirlpool. This suggests individual pillars may arise from various geological processes, complicating the origin explanation for larger groups.

- **Frost Action Theory**  
  Theories linking pillars to seasonal frost action do not account for the shapes and contexts of many structures. Features such as deep, narrow shapes challenge the viability of frost effects as a consistent cause.

- **Heat Exposure**  
  Evidence from a pillar east of Drayton, Ontario, indicates signs of intense heat in the form of glazed and cracked outer boulders. The unusual composition defies simplified frost action explanations, suggesting a complex formation process.

- **Disintegration as Formation Process**  
  The theory that rock disintegration contributes to cross stratification provides a cohesive explanation for pillar formation. This view aligns with a belief that much of the sedimentary rock in Earth's crust formed during a significant global flood. 

- **Relationship Between Pillars and Potholes**  
  The proposed mechanism for creating drift pillars might clarify similarities with potholes, which are generally formed by erosive processes. The resemblance in shape and structure implies a shared origin, complicating traditional sedimentary narratives.

- **Pillar Structures in Sandstone**  
  Examples of pillars and pipes found in various sandstone formations, like the Potsdam sandstone, share similarities with drift pillars. Concentric internal structures and the presence of vertical pillars suggest a broader phenomenon across geological locations.

- **Free-Standing Pillars**  
  Observations of free-standing sandstone pillars in different regions indicate these may represent the result of extensive disintegration processes. Similar features to traditional potholes were noted, enhancing the understanding of their formation types.

- **Geological Disintegration Theory**  
  By examining forms related to disintegration, it becomes apparent that both pillars and potholes serve as geological indicators of ancient processes. Further studies could clarify the mechanisms behind their formations and possible implications for understanding ancient environments.
# Predictions Based on the New Theory [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Potholes**: The contents of potholes should reveal concentric features, internal cross stratification, or other features similar to those of pillars in sandstone and drift. This prediction can be tested through future observations to verify or refute the theory presented.

- **Pillars in Cave Fill**: Pillars similar to those which occur in drift may also be expected in cave fill. Given that potholes are common in caves, the pillars' presence can be interpreted as a result of disintegration analogous to the processes suggested for the drift.

# Why Pillars Are of Interest to a Creationist [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Polystrate Structures**: Many pillars are not fossils in the traditional sense, but as polystrate formations, they provide compelling evidence for rapid strata formation. Their existence challenges the conventional uniformitarian explanations, suggesting a different geological process.

- **Escaping Uniformitarian Explanations**: The failure of uniformitarian methods to successfully explain these structures reinforces the interest for creationists. The proposed explanations may offer a more coherent narrative that can be tested through observable predictions.

# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Cylindrical Structures in Permian (?) Siltstone**: Numerous cylindrical structures found in calcareous siltstone beds are perpendicular to bedding and share identical composition with the surrounding material. These cylinders are interpreted as fossil springs or quicksand pipes formed from local hydrostatic pressure.

- **Conical and Cylindrical Structures in the Potsdam Sandstone**: These structures, including two cylindrical and one inverted conical, have been previously interpreted as concretions or products of whirlpool action in potholes. The formation of these structures appears to be tied to movements of unconsolidated sand into cavities created by falling sand.

- **Sandstone Pipes of the Laguna Area, New Mexico**: Hundreds of sandstone columns called sandstone pipes are exposed, piercing through nearly horizontal strata of Jurassic age. These pipes exhibit characteristics of reworked sandstone and were likely formed during sedimentation processes involving poorly consolidated sediments.

- **Columnar Structure in Limestone**: Rare columnar structures in limestone have been observed, one of which occurs in a unique geological setting at Temiscouata Lake, providing a problematic account for its origin. These columns are noted for their rapid disintegration and irregular formation, possibly influenced by tectonic forces.

# Erratic Boulders in Strata [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Origin of the Giant Conglomerates of Green Mountain and Crook's Mountain**: Large granite boulders are embedded in conglomerate beds, showcasing a size increase from the base to the upper layers. This supports the theory that the conglomerate was deposited in front of a rising thrust block, allowing for the movement of increasingly larger boulders.

- **Catastrophic Stratigraphy**: Deposits in places like Timor exhibit large exotic blocks that appear far from their origin, suggesting catastrophic processes responsible for their distribution. This phenomenon raises questions about historical events that could have allowed such transport and deposition, as seen in other regions worldwide.

- **The Origin and Age of the Boulder-Bearing Johns Valley Shale**: The Johns Valley shale is characterized by irregularly distributed boulders from various geological formations, raising questions about its origin and age. The boulders' fossils and lithologic features can help identify their sources, revealing a complex geological history that challenges conventional stratigraphic boundaries.
# Inclusions in Strata [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Boulders Deviation:** The boulders observed have fossiliferous Devonian chert that closely resembles the Camden chert found in Tennessee, which is not present in the Arbuckle Mountains district. This suggests that the boulders were derived from formations foreign to the local geology.

- **Absence of Johns Valley Shale:** The formation of Johns Valley shale, which is not present in the existing Arbuckle Mountains area, is specifically noted. This absence indicates that the boulders are not sourced from the Arbuckle region.

- **Ozark-type Boulder Similarity:** Many boulders found near Boles, Arkansas resemble units known in the Ozarks more than those in the Arbuckle Mountains. This highlights a discrepancy in boulder formation sources.

- **Ancestral Ouachita Mountains Uplift:** An important uplift of Ozark-Arbuckle type rocks occurred along the northwestern front of the Ouachita Mountains. This uplift is thought to have contributed "erratic materials" to marine sedimentation areas.

- **Johns Valley Shale Composition:** The Johns Valley shale consists of components that are derived from formations of the Arbuckle-Ozark type that are foreign to the geologic section of the Ouachita geosyncline. The erratic constituents span a range of ages, contributing to complexity in determining the age of the formation.

- **Haymond Boulder Beds Composition:** The "Haymond boulder beds" are described as sedimentary layers with recorded outcrops exhibiting conglomerate strata identified as evidence of diastrophism and uplift. Various types of rock, including Precambrian granite and fossiliferous Pennsylvanian limestone, indicate a mixed geological history.

- **Transported Boulder Evidence:** The boulders described as being of various types indicate that they're a part of boulder-bed members of the upper Haymond formation. This complexity suggests a history of faulting and early growth of Pennsylvanian folds.

- **Housetop Mountain Boulder Type:** The sedimentary fragments found at Housetop Mountain indicate a primary composition of well-rounded igneous and metamorphic rocks. This supports a history of transport and accumulation under complex sedimentary processes.

- **Iceberg Transport Conclusion:** Evidence suggests that icebergs carried boulders from ancient mountains in Oklahoma into Arkansas during the Carboniferous period. This transport method indicates a significant geological event that shaped the region.

- **Massive Boulder Occurrences:** Fragments found in the Boles locality indicate that the ice-transported boulders vary significantly in size, with some measuring up to 200 feet in length. This suggests a previously active glacial environment with substantial geological ramifications.

- **Iceberg Origin Theory:** The existence of iceberg-formed deposits in Arkansas serves as one of the first documented occurrences of ice-transported boulders in the region. This theory aligns with observations made in southeastern Oklahoma.

- **Columnar Holes Description:** The formation of columnar holes in wandering dunes involves the decay of treelike structures buried beneath shifting sands. These holes serve as remnants of a past forest, illustrating the dynamic geological processes involved in dune formation.

- **Quicksand Structures Findings:** Structures resembling quicksand movement were identified in the bedded tuffs of Great Langdale. These findings suggest that sediment behavior involved repacking and pore-water expulsion, contributing to sedimentary dynamics.

- **Sandstone Dikes Evidence:** Sandstone dikes in California are noted for their prevalence and specific geological interactions. Their formation appears to correlate with seismic activity common to the area's geological context.

- **Limestones as Eruptive Rocks Hypothesis:** A discussion emerged regarding the origination of limestones in association with alkali-rich igneous intrusions, provoking inquiries into transformer dynamics. This speculation challenges prevailing sedimentation views, highlighting the need to reassess geological formation theories.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Limestone as a primary mineral**  
  Geologists have been hesitant to accept calcite as a primary mineral due to the ease with which it dissociates upon heating. However, recent evidence suggests that intrusive carbonate rocks, such as crystalline limestones, may actually have a magmatic origin in locations like Alno.

- **Magmatic origin of limestone in Southern Nyasaland**  
  Dr. F. Dixey's research indicates that crystalline limestone found in breccias from post-Karoo vents, like those on Chilwa Island, may have a magmatic origin rather than being derived from smaller limestone bodies in the Basement Complex. The presence of alkali-rich rock dykes further supports this conclusion, pointing towards an integrated magmatic process.

- **Dogmatic origin of carbonate rocks in Norway**  
  Mr. S.I. Tomkeieff asserts the dogmatic origin of carbonate rocks in Norway, aligning with earlier conclusions presented by W.C. Brogger. This suggests a broader classification and understanding of limestone origins across regions with geologically similar formations.

- **Sedimentary origin of carbonate rocks**  
  Prof. S.J. Shand posits that many limestones, including those at Alno and Fen, are derived from sedimentary or metamorphosed sedimentary sources. He references specific areas where carbonate-rocks associated with nepheline-syenite demonstrate the incorporation of sedimentary limestone into magmatic processes.

- **Peculiarities of limestone intrusions in Haliburton and Bancroft**  
  Prof. C.E. Tilley acknowledges that while some limestone-syntexis theories can apply, the limestone intrusions in certain areas present peculiar characteristics that distinguish them from other limestone occurrences. Nonetheless, he maintains that magmatic origin is valid for most limestone examples in Prof. Shand's comprehensive list.

# Unusual Flint Bodies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Paramoudra enigma**  
  The Paramoudra, a singular fossil body found in Northern Ireland's chalk, presents a remarkable geological puzzle. These flint bodies, which vary in size and structure, possess central apertures filled with chalk, raising questions about their formation and origin.

- **Vertical "Potstones" found in Norwich**  
  Sir Charles Lyell's observations noted the presence of vertical flints, termed "Potstones," intersecting the horizontal flint nodules near Norwich. This phenomenon challenges standard models of formation since these vertical structures appear continuous without any apparent disruption from surrounding sedimentary layers.

# Problems in the Glacial Theory [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Drift deposits and glacial striations south of ice sheets**  
  There are notable drift deposits and apparent glacial striations found significantly south of the established ice sheets, complicating the interpretation of glacial activity. This raises questions about the underlying mechanisms that could have caused such patterns and formations away from direct glacial influence.

- **Erratic blocks above original quarries**  
  The occurrence of erratic blocks positioned hundreds of feet above their source quarries poses a challenge to the traditional understanding of glacial movement. Their elevation suggests a powerful force or event that must be reconsidered outside the conventional ice sheet dynamics.

- **Striations indicating northward motion of ice sheets**  
  Some striations found suggest a northward movement that contradicts the expected patterns of glacial retreat in areas where southward flow was presumed. This anomaly could imply that complex interactions or different processes were at play during ice sheet dynamics.

- **Distributions and structures of drumlins and eskers**  
  The peculiar dimensions and internal structures of some drumlins and eskers defy straightforward explanations within the glacial framework. Their formation may reflect more complex geological processes than the existing models suggest.

- **Boulder trains linked to catastrophic flooding**  
  The theory regarding boulder trains and their associated erosion implies that they might have been formed through catastrophic flooding rather than through gradual glacial processes. This alternative view draws attention to the need for broader interpretations of geological events in shaping the landscape.

- **Enclaves devoid of drift**  
  The presence of areas without drift, or "driftless enclaves," poses significant challenges to the Ice Age theory, suggesting selective preservation or post-glacial processes that may have overlooked these regions. Such observations necessitate the exploration of additional influencing geological factors beyond the standard glacial models.
# Howorth's Objections Considered [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Many of the assumptions involved in the glacial theory are contrary to physical laws and known facts about the properties of ice. Howorth argued that these flawed assumptions reveal a reluctance among geologists to accept a catastrophic alternative to the glacial theory.

- Howorth advocated a return to the older view that the drift layers were deposits from the Noachian flood, transported by violent currents. This perspective was widely accepted before the prominence of the glacial theory, which he believed lacked compelling evidence.

# Difficulties in the Glacial Theory [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The distribution of drift presents challenges to the notion that it has been caused by glaciers, as it is absent in expected areas and present in tropical regions. For instance, drift has been reported in places like the Amazon jungles, where glaciers should not logically exist.

- Current glacial deposits are different in character from the drift attributed to ancient ice-sheets, showing angular fragments rather than the rounded boulders characteristic of drift. This inconsistency raises questions about the validity of the glacial theory, especially since present-day glaciers do not form deposits similar to those claimed from the past.

# The Cause of an Ice Age Still Undetermined [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The numerous astronomical theories proposed to explain ice ages have not resulted in a generally accepted explanation, as the matter remains confusing and unresolved. Considerable contradiction exists among experts, indicating a lack of consensus despite extensive discussions.

- The recent emphasis has shifted from finding specific causes for glaciation to understanding broader climate change factors. This reframing reflects ongoing uncertainty within the scientific community regarding the origins and processes of glacial events.

# Problems About the Motion of the Ice [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The glacial theory relies on the assumption that large ice-sheets moved and transported materials, but the mechanics of this movement are not well-understood. Significant difficulties arise, particularly concerning how erratics can be found far from their supposed sources.

- Howorth pointed out that glacier ice is incapable of traveling over large flat areas or uphill, as the ice would crush under its own weight rather than move. This fundamental flaw in the theory suggests that the mechanics of ice movement need to be reconsidered to align with observed physics.

# How Could the Ice Move Uphill? [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- There is a critical issue in explaining how glaciers could move boulders uphill over long distances, a phenomenon not observed in contemporary glaciers. The mechanics of current ice-sheets demonstrate that they achieve a uniform slope, yet the glacial theory requires an explanation for this contradictory movement.

- Appeal to transcendental causes for glacier mechanics is seen as a departure from established physical laws, raising concerns about the validity of arguments made by proponents of the glacial theory. Such reasoning is criticized for lacking scientific rigor, especially when empirical evidence contradicts these assumptions.
# The Drift [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Transcendental Ice**  
  The glacial theory relies on properties of ice as observed today, suggesting that any appeal to a transcendental ice, not observed currently, relegates the theory to the realm of philosophy. This raises questions about the scientific validity of the glacial theory, as it hinges on properties that supposedly do not align with the nature of ice.

- **Uphill Motion**  
  The motion of ice described by the glacial theory suggests that ice can move uphill, which contradicts the fundamental principles of gravity. As noted by Sir Henry Howorth, such behavior requires an explanation beyond present-day experiences of ice movement.

- **Basal Movement of Ice-Sheets**  
  The theory posits that the formation of drumlins and flutings involves a significant basal movement within ice-sheets. However, the causes of this assumed motion remain mysterious, particularly as drumlins in regions like Northern New York show indications of being formed by uphill flow.

- **Gravity and Ice Motion**  
  The concept of "gravitational pressure of the rearward mass" is cited as a mechanism for the ice to flow uphill. This raises several paradoxes since higher altitude drumlins appear to contradict the principle of gravitational movement under current understanding of ice behavior.

- **Limit to Ice Mass Movement**  
  Sir Henry Howorth critiques the concept that massive ice-sheets can be pushed significantly without fracturing. He argues that pushing an ice mass greater than seven miles in extent would lead to its crushing and the dissipation of forces required for movement.

- **Streamlining and Drift Formation**  
  The streamlined forms of drumlins suggest their shaping involved moving ice, yet this same motion is supposed to have occurred after the ice melted. This contradicts the accepted timeline and suggests the presence of moving ice after melting involving drift, complicating the glacial theory.

- **Melted Ice Activity**  
  It is unclear how melted ice could resume shaping drift formations post-melting, as it supposedly failed to leave any debris behind. This presents a contradiction within the theory about the processes that form drumlins and streamline landforms.

- **Erosion vs. Stratification**  
  The process of erosion proposed by the advancement of glaciers raises questions about the preservation of cross strata in sedimentary deposits. This conflicts with the idea that moving ice would destroy all traces of such stratification in the material it moves over.

- **Debris Distribution**  
  The suggestion that ice sheets during their advance could have shaped drumlins without accumulating debris raises difficulties in understanding their formation. If the ice was indeed melting and simultaneously advancing, it poses questions about the lack of drift accumulations above the streamlined surfaces.

- **Problems with Erosion of Hard Bedrock**  
  Critics, including Howorth, suggest that it is improbable for ice sheets to erode hard bedrock while leaving softer strata unharmed. This presents a significant challenge to the glacial theory, which assumes ice can carve formations from both rigid and loose materials.

- **Angular vs. Rounded Particles**  
  The discrepancy between angular sand and rounded stones in drift challenges the glacial theory, as one would expect similar shapes from similar geological processes of transport and erosion. This raises questions about the processes assumed to be active during glacial periods.

- **Cross Stratification Mechanism**  
  The origins of cross stratification within the drift are not well explained under the glacial theory, leading to mysteries regarding how these patterns formed in a presumed glacial environment. Observations of the sediment layers indicate that classical river deposition mechanisms do not align with glacial processes.

- **Kames and Eskers Enigma**  
  The origins of kames and eskers present further difficulties, notably in distinguishing their formations from those expected under glacial conditions. Since the processes that formed these structures are not clearly understood in the context of ice movements, they remain enigmatic within the glacial framework.

- **Course of Eskers**  
  The sinuous nature of eskers following elevations contradicts straightforward scenarios of ice movement, necessitating multiple explanations that may not coherently align. This ambiguity highlights the complexity and unresolved issues surrounding glacial theory, pointing to potential flaws in the explanations provided.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Icedisintegration Features**: These features are believed to be a result of ice sheets disintegrating into isolated blocks during melting. The presence of these structures has led to conflicting interpretations among Quaternary geologists regarding the processes involved in the melting and disintegration of ice.

- **Anomalous Fossils in Supposed Glacial Deposits**: Fossils found in drift deposits challenge the assumption that the Quaternary era was solely characterized by cold-climate lifeforms. The discovery of a wide variety of lifeforms, some suggesting warmer climates, raises questions about the interpretation of these fossil assemblages in the context of glacial theory.

# Drift South of the Ice Sheets [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Glacial Pebbles in Eastern Kentucky**: The discovery of erratic pebbles in northeastern Kentucky presents the first evidence supporting glacial ponding in an area previously thought devoid of glacial characteristics. The hypothesis suggests that these pebbles are remnants of both river and glacial front sources, likely transported by floating ice during the readjustment of drainage systems in the region.

- **Striated Boulders on the Southern Coastal Plain of Virginia**: The occurrence of striated and faceted boulders across the Coastal Plain suggests glacial action, as evidenced by their distribution and characteristics. While some are believed to have originated from ice, the exact mechanisms of their striation remain uncertain, prompting further geologic exploration.

- **Striated Cobbles in Southern States**: Found in terrace deposits along the Potomac and James rivers, these cobbles resemble those deposited from stranded ice blocks and challenge traditional interpretations of glacial influence. Their presence along the Tennessee River basin indicates a broader distribution that may suggest mechanisms of formation distinct from direct glaciation.

- **Possible Evidence of Pleistocene Ice Action in Southeast Texas**: The presence of numerous boulders of varying geological origin along the Brazos River, far from their outcrops, suggests a formative process involving ice or water. Their peculiar striations and stratigraphic relations hint at a possible ancient ice jam, which could explain their current distribution and preservation.

- **Glacial Phenomena in Nicaragua**: Drift deposits in Nicaragua containing unstratified beds of gravel alongside highly contorted schists present an anomaly in the expected geological formations of the region. This evidence of glacial activity raises questions about historical climatic conditions and the extent of ice influence in less commonly studied areas.
# The Drift [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Transported Boulders Near Ocotal**
  The transported boulders near Ocotal are situated about three thousand feet above sea level, while those near Libertad are approximately two thousand feet high. This anomaly suggests that the ice of the Glacial era extended significantly further south than previously believed.

- **Glacial Scratches South of the Terminal Moraine**
  Glacial scratches observed near the mouth of the Connoquenessig show grooves that are five feet wide and eighteen inches deep, indicating intense glacial activity. These grooves challenge previous assertions regarding the extent of glacial phenomena, suggesting a more complex distribution of local glaciers south of the presumed terminal moraine.

- **Erratics at High Levels in Northwestern America**
  Boulders from the Laurentian Axis have been found distributed across the Great Plains up to twenty-five miles from the Rocky Mountains, reaching elevations of around 4,200 feet. The position of these erratics raises questions about how they could have been transported there, with hypotheses suggesting either glacial movement or sea-borne ice transport.

- **Bowlder Trains of Richmond and Great Barrington**
  The Richmond train extends in a nearly straight line from Fryes Hill into Berkshire County, but the boulders diminish in size and number as the train continues. The angular appearance and freshness of the boulders suggest they have not been subjected to significant weathering, indicating a recent glacial activity.

- **Kettle-Holes and Boulders of Granite in Kentucky**
  High-level kettle-holes and granite boulders are found at significant elevations above contemporary water levels, suggesting unusual past hydrological events. These observations point to the possibility that substantial glacial activity contributed to shaping the current landscape in ways not previously accounted for.

- **Glacial Influence on Kentucky's Clay Deposits**
  The clay and cherty formations of Kentucky display characteristics akin to those found in glacial deposits, possibly influenced by a vast continental ice-sheet. These findings challenge traditional notions of glacial geography and suggest a more southern extent of glacial influences in North America.

- **Ice-Age Boulders in the Isle of Man**
  Boulders on the Isle of Man that have been carried nearly eight hundred feet above their source indicate significant glacial movement. This phenomenon mirrors similar occurrences elsewhere, confirming that glaciers can indeed transport materials to elevations well beyond their origin.

- **Rhone Glacier Terminal Moraine Elevations**
  The terminal moraine of the northern branch of the Rhone glacier is found approximately two hundred feet above the Lake of Geneva, contradicting expectations based on glacial behavior. This finding is pivotal, suggesting that glaciers might exhibit more complex movement patterns than anticipated, including climbing uphill.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Boulders Distribution and Variation**  
  The distribution of bowlders in the valley of Seekonk Brook shows considerable variation, with a lesser number occurring north of Alford compared to the southeast toward Great Barrington. There is a notable difference in their form and condition, as those in Great Barrington are rounded and weathered, distinct from the angular blocks of the Richmond train.

- **Weathering Effects on Boulder Characteristics**  
  The bowlders in the southern train are well-rounded and exhibit marked weathering effects, contrasting with the fresh, angular surfaces of the Richmond train. Weathering has not only discolored the surface but has also penetrated beneath it, indicating a longer exposure to environmental elements.

- **Concentration of Boulders**  
  Among the walls in the Seekonk Valley, numerous boulders were discovered built into stone walls along roadsides, with some remaining in the fields, highlighting their concentration in specific areas. This concentration includes rounded and weathered boulders of various rock types, notably the green Rensselaer grit, which closely resembles the amphibolite.

- **Geographical Source Doubts**  
  The distance of boulders near Great Harrington from Fryes Hill raises questions about their origin, as the current evidence does not firmly establish their source from that hill. Observations suggest the possibility of another source, as smaller bowlders with similar characteristics were discovered near Queechy Lake.

- **Outcrop Hypothesis**  
  The occurrences of amphibolite schist on Haystack Mountain and elsewhere raise issues regarding whether the nearby boulders in the Konkapot Valley could originate from these outcrops. The direction of ice movement indicates that it would be unlikely for these boulders to have been transported from such outcrops given the required distance.

# The Nature of the Englacial Drift of the Mississippi Basin [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Boulder Belts' Formation and Distribution**  
  Boulder belts in the Upper Mississippi region have unique configurations resembling terminal moraines, although not all patches have been studied thoroughly. Areas most examined include parts of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Dakota.

- **Irregular Patterns of Boulder Scattering**  
  Surface boulders with irregular forms and uncertain relationships are prevalent in the region between the Wabash and Kankakee rivers, particularly in northern Indiana. The formation of these patches appears closely tied to the intermingled morainic features characteristic of the local geography.

- **Diverse Geological Origins**  
  While surface boulders were derived mostly from the crystalline terranes of Canada, some erratics consist of impure limestone or limy sandstone that poses a challenge in classifying their origin. Most boulders align with specific types like Huronian rocks and granitic or gneissoid formations, lacking substantial representation from the intervening paleozoic rocks.

- **Superficial Boulder Characteristics**  
  The boulders of these surface belts are typically superficial and range in ubiquity, appearing anywhere from fully exposed to completely buried beneath different sediment types. This unique positioning distinctly contrasts the compositions of underlying till layers, emphasizing their disparate origins.

- **Angularity of Boulders**  
  Unlike the typical rounded boulders found in till sheets, the boulders in the described series tend to be more angular and show less evidence of glacial abrasion. This difference in shape suggests a distinct transport mechanism, with the angular boulders implying limited glacial rounding and more surface degradation processes.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Absence of Commingling**  
  The conspicuous absence of characteristic markings that should have been left by boulders lifted from the base of the ice indicates a distinctness in the methods of transportation involved. This rarity of any semblance of commingling further supports the idea that basal and englacial materials were not habitually mixed in the interior regions.

- **Calgary Silt Characteristics**  
  The Calgary silt, a thick layer of poorly stratified brown silt, lacks varves, coarse sand, or gravel, suggesting its deposition under turbulent flow conditions rather than as a typical river deposit. Its characteristics do not resemble the expected outputs of nearby mountain rivers or glacier-derived materials, raising questions about its origin.

- **Erratics Train Emplacement**  
  The Erratics Train, composed of large quartzite boulders, was transported to its current location without evidence of striation or rounding, indicating an unusual method of emplacement. The lack of features commonly associated with glacial transport suggests a significant deviation from expected geological processes.

- **Calgary River Anomaly**  
  The "Calgary River" is characterized by a significant width and an anomalous elevation gradient that does not align with traditional river systems. Its failure to incise a recognizable channel suggests that it may not have functioned as a normal river, challenging established geological understandings.

- **Bone Bed Deposition**  
  The bone beds located along the Bow River were deposited in a way that does not align with the river's current course, indicating they may not be part of the Calgary River deposition. The discrepancies suggest alternative explanations for their formation and imply a complex geological history.

- **Erratics Size and Transport Mechanism**  
  The "Big Rock" Erratic weighs around 20,000 tons and shows no signs of glacial transport, complicating explanations for its emplacement. The theory of icerafting is proposed, requiring massive bodies of water to facilitate the transportation of such large boulders while maintaining their fresh state.

- **Tidal Inundation Proposal**  
  The concept of tidal inundation is introduced as a plausible mechanism for the transport and deposition of erratics, suggesting that a massive tide may have contributed to the geological anomalies seen today. This theory provides a framework for understanding the conditions under which these large boulders were emplaced far from their original location.

- **Lake Bonneville's Anomalies**  
  Investigations into Lake Bonneville suggest that its high beaches and salinity levels cannot be satisfactorily explained by established models, indicating the need for a reassessment of its geological history. The presence of rounded pebbles and distinctly shaped beach features point to complex hydrological processes that may involve tidal influences.

- **Bliss Boulder Field Energy Source**  
  The distribution of large basalt boulders in the Bliss boulder field raises questions about their energy source for emplacement, suggesting the absence of sufficient current power in the present Snake River. The hypothesis is proposed that a tumultuous tidal system could have been responsible for displacing these boulders over considerable distances.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomalous Groove Formation**  
  The presence of polished and smoothed rock surfaces found on mountain tops raises questions about the functioning of glaciers. It challenges traditional theories on how glaciers could shape the landscapes without a direct physical restraint.

- **Absent Striated Stones**  
  Geographical regions such as the plains of Northern Italy lack evidence of the typical stony clay found in places like Switzerland, despite historical glacial descent. This absence indicates that glaciers may not have produced the drift observed in these areas.

- **Glacial Sheet Formation Inconsistency**  
  The theory that glaciers could form extensive continental sheets of till is debunked by the lack of evidence suggesting their ability to reach such remote locations. Existing glacial evidence does not support the claim of a significant glacial presence in far regions.

- **Limitations of Glacier Impact**  
  Local glaciers are quantitatively insufficient to account for the vast areas of drift debris identified across different landscapes. This raises significant doubts about glaciers being the sole producers of the volume of drift we currently observe.

- **Curved Striations**  
  Unique curved glacial striations have been noted in certain regions, which seem to defy the assumption of a straightforward glacial action. Their presence indicates complex interactions and possible shifts in the flow of glacial ice.

- **Giant Grooves in Laurentian Hills**  
  Massive grooves have been documented on the Cloche Mountains with variations in depth and breadth, suggesting dynamic glacial action. These observations propose a different understanding of past glacial movements across hard metamorphic rock surfaces.

- **Serrated Striae Observations**  
  The serrations found on rock formations along certain river banks indicate unusual glacial actions. Their distinctive characteristics challenge standard explanations as to how they were formed.

- **Marking Direction of Ice Movement**  
  New markings that reveal the specific direction of glacial movement can help gauge the pressures exerted during glaciation. This method could provide valuable insights into the kinetic behaviors of ice during the Drift Period.

- **Scoop Marks Interpretation Challenges**  
  The origin and formation of scoop marks in various regions remain perplexing, with some even proposing that they may not have been created by glacial activity. These elongated excavations prompt further inquiry into their actual cause.

- **Unstriated Scoop Marks Differences**  
  Unstriated scoop marks are distinct from their striated counterparts, being smoother and smaller on average. They pose a mystery regarding their formation and how they differ in impact from traditional ice markings.
# GIANT GLACIAL GROOVES IN NORTHWEST CANADA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- In the Mackenzie Valley area west of Great Bear Lake, glacial grooves are unusually large, with individual grooves measuring up to 100 feet in depth and over one mile in length. These grooves are straight and parallel, reflecting the influence of bedrock erodibility and topographic position.

# GIANT GLACIAL GROOVES AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN THE JACKSON HOLE AREA, WYOMING [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The ice covered over 1300 square miles in Jackson Hole and was as much as 2500 feet thick in places. Some grooves extend beneath the alluvium-covered floor of Jackson Hole, indicating minimal erosion in broad valley areas after this glacial stage.

- The grooves range in size from minor fluting to U-shaped valleys that are 400 feet deep and 1500 feet wide. Longitudinal median points are higher than the ends of grooves, suggesting they could not be stream channels.

- Thin deposits of Buffalo till veneer most grooves, while ends of the grooves extending across Flat Creek are buried by a moraine of Bull Lake (?) age. The difference in elevation between the highest and lowest grooves, located 2 miles apart along the Gros Ventre River, is 2000 feet.

- Groove swarms appear where the principal channelway narrows and where ice impinged against moderately sloping valley sides, and these swarms are not necessarily localized in leewards of sources of rock that could serve as abrasive tools. The most extensive ice sources were the Yellowstone Park, Absaroka, and Wind River mountains.

# PLEISTOCENE GLACIATION IN THE BLUERIDGE PROVINCE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Glacial polish, grooves, and striations found at 1370 meters elevation in the headwaters of Boone Fork on Grandfather Mountain indicate previous alpine glaciation. This Boone Fork glacier was located 890 kilometers south of the previously recognized southern limit of alpine glaciation in the Appalachian Mountains.

# NORTHWARD MOVING ICE IN THE THETFORD MINES AREA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Evidence of northward moving ice in the Thetford Mines area is based solely on crag-and-tail glacial striations observed on horizontal or sub-horizontal bedrock surfaces. This proposed northward movement is believed to represent a local deviation in late-glacial time from the more common southeastward direction as the ice sheet thinned due to melting.

# THEASAR OR OSAR OF SCANDANAVIA AND FINLAND [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The asar is a notable feature in the landscape of Sweden, which has been described by various explorers and divides into two classes: the asar properly consisting of rolled stones and sand-asar made primarily of sand. There are examples where masses of rolled stones and beds of sand or tough clay pass into each other, similar to formations seen in the Cromer cliffs.

- The contour and nature of the asar vary with their contents, featuring steep sides for the stony asar and rounder outlines for the sandy ones. The remarkable rounded stones found within the asar are predominantly water-worn and are often described as "cannon-shot gravel." 

- The asar traverse the landscape irrespective of the underlying topography, frequently going uphill and downhill or across natural drainage paths. Erdmann noted that although they can sometimes follow valleys or mountain flanks, their overall direction tends to be singularly parallel in Sweden.

- A significant feature is the extensive size and volume of these gigantic mounds, with some traced over long distances—such as the Upsala asar, which is about 200 kilometers long. The height of the asar can vary greatly, often reaching up to 100 metres or more in some areas.

- The majority of the asar consist of rounded stones, typically not mixed with angular erratics, and are arranged with their longer axes generally aligned with the trend of the asar. Stratified sand and stiff blue clay with marine shells can be found at the uppermost layers of the asar, but they commonly lack fresh-water debris or terrestrial mollusks. 

# THE ORIGIN OF DRUMLINS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The origins of drumlins remain debated, with two main theories: one suggesting they are formed by the erosion of pre-existing drift, while the other postulates they are depositional in nature. Recent support leans more towards the depositional theory, although it struggles to explain the formation of drumlins with extreme compositions.

- Many drumlins have been found to form from materials existing before the ice advance, leading some to theorize that erosion must have been a factor in their creation. The shape and alignment of many drumlins also point towards a consistent erosive process, indicating a complex interaction between glacial movements and pre-existing landscapes.
# Objections to the Erosional Theory [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Thwaites suggested that drumlins of the erosional type should be shaped like roches moutonnees; yet it is well known that drumlins formed from pre-existing materials have the same shape as till drumlins. This suggests that the expected correlation between erosional shape and composition is not valid.  
- The width of drumlin belts (10-20 miles) exceeds that of most moraines. This discrepancy in size raises questions about the validity of the erosional theory as it pertains to drumlins.  
- The drift in drumlins is apparently the same age as the surrounding drift. This might indicate that there is no evidence of readvance of the ice in many areas where there are till drumlins.  

# Modified Erosion Theory [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Drumlin formation may involve a combination of clay till, sandy or loamy till, rock, and pre-existing drift, suggesting a diverse composition. Rock drumlins are found side by side with other varieties and maintain a consistent shape.  
- Many glaciated regions do not support the presence of drumlins. This indicates that drumlins are not universally formed in all glaciated areas, which challenges the robustness of their defining characteristics.  
- Drumlins exist in fields that are wider than most moraines and rarely occur singly. This suggests a systematic formation process that is likely influenced by glacial movement rather than random deposition.  

# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The absence of drumlins from certain regions of clay till can be explained by a relatively rapid ice advance. This implies that the ice movement dynamics can greatly influence the formation of drumlins.  
- The lamination found in a few drumlins could be the result of ice pressure. Any clay minerals present may have preferred orientation due to the applied pressure, leading to a rough fissility in the till.  
- Areas where drumlins have been found with cores suggest that during a slow advance, any pre-existing irregularities would have been covered with a layer of till. This layering is necessary for drumlin formation, posing questions about the conditions required for their development.  

# Boulder Fields [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Hickory Run boulder field is irregular in outline and characterized by a surface of unsorted, loosely packed boulders up to 20 feet or more in length. Its flat appearance, despite minor irregularities, indicates a unique geological history, likely influenced by periglacial conditions.  
- The surface of the boulder field shows a complete absence of finer interstitial material down to water level, suggesting a history of mechanical weathering. The morphology of the field suggests that the boulders were left immobile during deglaciation, leading to their current state of stagnation and decay.
# The Drift [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Bouldery Surface Anomaly**  
  The observation suggests that if the forest and soil mantle were stripped from the slopes, a bouldery surface similar to that of the boulder field would be produced. This implication raises questions about the geomorphological processes at play in this specific region.

- **Swampy Flat Anomaly**  
  A large, swampy flat located about half a mile east of the boulder field is bordered by rock ledges that rise approximately 40 feet. The disintegration of these ledges in place is peculiar, especially given the absence of active creep toward the valley.

- **Discontinuity of Boulder Bands**  
  Narrow, irregular, and discontinuous bouldery bands persist upvalley from the boulder field for several hundred feet. This discontinuity indicates a unique geological history that contrasts with the more uniform bouldery areas typically found in mountainous regions.

- **Weathering Rate Anomaly**  
  A joint block remains largely unchanged while showing signs of weathering; it has rounded significantly despite minimal opening of the gap between it and the adjacent block. This disparity suggests that weathering processes may have outpaced the physical movement of the blocks.

- **Stream Emergence Anomaly**  
A definite stream emerges about half a mile below the boulder field, indicating dynamic hydrological processes at work in the bouldery area. The presence of flowing water amidst the boulders raises questions regarding the interaction between the water and the geological features.

# Comparison with Other Areas [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Area Size and Gradient Anomaly**  
  The comparison of talus and bouldery accumulations highlights that similar geological formations on low gradients in areas of moderate relief are much rarer. The Hickory Run boulder field stands out for its larger extent and lower gradient compared to these typical accumulations.

- **Rockstream Differences**  
  Although rock streams in Maryland, New York, and adjoining areas display similar surface characteristics to the Hickory Run boulder field, they are narrower, steeper, and have a smaller boulder size range. This makes the Hickory Run boulder field a unique geological feature in comparison.

- **Periglacial Feature Hypothesis**  
  The Hickory Run boulder field is theorized to be a relict phenomenon from a time of glaciation associated with colder climatic conditions. This assertion reflects a distinctive geological history shaped by accelerated weathering processes and mass movement during Wisconsin glaciation.

# Conclusions [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomalous Feature of Hickory Run**  
  The Hickory Run boulder field is seen as anomalous because it does not conform to the current geological processes of the area. Its characteristics suggest it originated from intense weathering and mass movement related to frost action, promoting unusual accumulation features.

# Periglacial Frost Wedging in the "Rock Cities" [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Block Formation Anomaly**  
  The "rock cities" consist of large blocks of massive conglomerate that are separated by interconnecting passages along widened joint planes. Their peculiar formation suggests unusual geological processes, possibly involving frost wedging that induced horizontal forces without significant down-slope movement.

- **Immobility of Blocks**  
  Currently, these blocks appear immobile and are gradually disintegrating in place, which implies a historical period of activity that is now stabilized. This immobility and state of disintegration are key indicators of the changes that have occurred in these periglacial environments.

# Strange Inclusions and Involutions in the Drift [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Frigites Anomaly**  
  The presence of large, well-defined blocks of materials like sand and gravel embedded in drift clays is an unusual phenomenon in Nebraska. These blocks contrast sharply with the glacial matrix, indicating unique depositional processes that have preserved their integrity despite weathering.

- **Involutions in Sediments**  
  Highly irregular, contorted structures in Pleistocene sediments, known as involutions, provide evidence of ancient frigid periglacial conditions. Their origin is linked to intense freezing and thawing processes, reflecting the complexity of geological changes associated with glaciation.

# Unglaciated Areas [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Unglaciated Enclaves in Glaciated Regions**  
  The study of nunatak and other unglaciated surfaces in glaciated areas reveals a complex history of glacial movements. The existence of these features poses significant considerations for understanding the interplay between glacial action and terrain formation.

- **Driftless Area Characteristics**  
  The Driftless Area of the Upper Mississippi, free from glacial deposits, offers a contrasting landscape against the surrounding drift-covered regions. This unique area provides crucial insights into the effects of glaciation on geological formations and hydrological systems.
# DRIFTLESS AREA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The great terminal moraine has a sinuous course across the continent, creating distinct contrasts between driftless and drift-bearing regions. Origin theories for the loess have evolved towards it being primarily an aqueous or lacustrine deposit of glacial clays. 

- Professor Chamberlin identifies several epochs related to glaciation, including an earlier glacial epoch with vegetation growth, and prolonged interglacial epochs characterized by significant land elevation. These processes led to the formation of the terminal moraine, with evidence of ice recession and advances illustrated by subordinate moraines. 

- The driftless area's origin is suggested to be due to elevated land north-east acting as a wedge that divided the advancing ice. This division, alongside the influence of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, hindered the reuniting of ice streams, influenced by climatic factors preventing further ice movement into the driftless region.

# NO DRIFT IN SIBERIA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Citing that extensive cold regions like Siberia do not exhibit the expected signs of glacial deposits, the text highlights the absence of "Drift" despite the area's frigid temperatures. Notably, the plains of Siberia lack evidence of glacial action, drawing a stark contrast to regions like Northern America and Europe.

- Prominent geologist James Geikie notes the lack of observed glacial traces in Siberia, which would be anticipated based on observations in equidistant cold zones worldwide. The absence of typical glacial deposits in Siberia leads to the conclusion that this northern area experienced no "Drift age."

# THE LOESS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Acknowledged for its widespread deposits of unconsolidated silt, loess is generally of Pleistocene origin and commonly found in areas adjacent to large ice sheets. Its unique properties and diverse theories regarding its origin underline its significance, particularly in shaping human activities in regions like China.

- Richthofen outlines specific anomalies associated with loess, such as its unusual petrographical and faunistic differences from other deposits. The consistent homogeneous structure of loess across continents further complicates the understanding of its formation and origin.

# ON THE MODE OF ORIGIN OF THE LOESS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The homogeneity in composition and structure found in loess across various geographical regions distinguishes it from sediments deposited by water in preceding geological epochs. Notably, the absence of stratification and consistency in structure despite varying altitudes pose challenges to traditional theories of sediment formation.

- Observations of loess reveal its unique angular quartz composition, vertical cleavage, and capillary structure indicative of distinct processes rather than water deposition. Such characteristics, alongside findings of land shells and large quantities of mammal bones, further validate loess's divergence from typical sedimentary deposits.

# THE LOESS-DEPOSITS OF NORTHERN CHINA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The discovery of extensive loess deposits across Northern China signifies a geological phenomenon essential for scientific exploration, with its coverage in certain terrains presenting implications for local agriculture and habitation. The unique properties of loess, including its porous nature and extensive distribution, challenge conventional understandings related to sedimentary formations from glacial periods.

- Geologists like Baron von Richthofen assert that the apparent layers of loess are influenced by external conditions, such as debris from surrounding hills, creating a false appearance of stratification. This theory counters previous hypotheses, emphasizing that the surface layers' characteristics stem from ongoing erosion processes rather than marine deposition origins.
# The Loess [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Traffic Disruption**
  - The extreme ease with which loess is cut away can significantly impede traffic. Dust created by cart-wheels on highways is lifted by strong winds, creating depressions in the road that can reach depths of fifty to one hundred feet.

- **Caves as Homes**
  - Caves formed at the bases of loess cliffs provide habitats for millions of people in northern provinces. These dwellings are often constructed wholly from loess, with entire villages forming interconnected chambers up to two hundred feet deep.

- **Unique Soil Fertility**
  - Loess has a remarkable ability to produce crops without the need for additional manure, contributing to its reputation as the "Granary of the Empire." This unique soil structure allows for high levels of nutrient absorption, with a continuous supply of mineral substances available for plants.

- **Meteoric Origin Hypothesis**
  - One proposed explanation for the origin of loess is meteoric, suggesting that the characteristics of loess, including its lack of stratification and angular grains, align more closely with deposits from meteorites than those formed by wind or water. This hypothesis argues that the peculiar chemical makeup of loess also resembles that of stony meteorites.

- **Absence of Stratification**
  - The absence of horizontal lamination challenges the wind and water deposit theories, supporting the notion of meteoric origins instead. Vertical stratification observed in loess cannot be easily accounted for by traditional sedimentary processes, suggesting alternative origins.

- **Dust Storms Contribution**
  - The dust storms common in Northern China may illustrate the process of loess formation, where dust settled in grass-covered areas over thousands of years. This leads to the accumulation of material and the development of the distinct characteristics of loess.

# Additional Note on the Origin of Loess [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Calcium Carbonate Tubes**
  - Observations suggest that vertical tubes of calcium carbonate found in loess may result from the action of descending rainwater. The presence of these tubes introduces complexity into the understanding of how loess forms and might reveal additional geochemical processes at play.

- **Influence of Meteoric Material**
  - The hypothesis posits that meteoritic material entering Earth's atmosphere could contribute to the unique characteristics of loess deposits. If the material underwent changes due to high temperature during atmospheric entry, it might explain the angularity of loess grains and their unusual composition.

- **American Loess Phenomenon**
  - The loess found near American rivers shows thickness variation not consistent with the wind deposition hypothesis and may suggest a more complex origin. The presence of substantial loess deposits at anomalous locations leads to questions about transportation mechanisms and depositional environments.

- **Testing the Eolian Hypothesis**
  - Logical evaluation points toward a failure of the eolian hypothesis to satisfactorily explain the characteristics of loess, particularly due to its angular grains. The absence of features that typically characterize wind deposits reinforces the idea of an alternative origin.

# Origin of North China Loess [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Chinese Civilization Development**
  - The development of early Chinese civilization is attributed to the rich loess deposits that provided ideal farming conditions, though the precise origin of these deposits remains debated. Unlike other loess around the world, which are often linked to glacial activity, North China loess has no clear glacial association.

- **Electron Microscope Insights**
  - Recent observations using electron microscopy reveal that grains of Chinese loess are broken and sharp-edged, pointing away from the theory of in situ formation. Although some glacial influence may be present, the majority of the material likely originates from distantly located glaciated regions.

- **Transportation Mechanisms**
  - The formation of loess may involve a larger transportation stage where material is derived from distant sources rather than local glacial deposits. Continued aridity and mixed particle deposition during post-Pleistocene times may have hindered the formation of stable loess deposits.

- **Geological Studies in China**
  - Renewed interest in loess sedimentology in China highlights the complexities surrounding the origin and characteristics of North China loess. This suggests a need for further research into the unique processes that shaped these deposits compared to other regions worldwide.
# Patterned Ground [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Polar Patterned Ground**  
  Polar patterned ground is characterized by its occurrence primarily in polar, sub-polar, and alpine regions. This patterned ground can be classified into sorted and nonsorted varieties, which helps clarify terminology in a field often riddled with synonyms.

- **Classification of Patterned Ground**  
  The classification of patterned ground is complicated due to myriad overlapping terms and ambiguous definitions. It encompasses various forms, including patterns like circles, polygons, nets, steps, and stripes, which can arise from multiple formative processes.

- **Sorted Circles**  
  Sorted circles are defined by their circular mesh and a surrounding stone border that contributes to their sorted appearance. These circles are often found in polar environments, with their diameters ranging significantly depending on their specific formation conditions.

- **Nonsorted Circles**  
  Nonsorted circles possess a circular mesh but lack a distinct stone border, giving them a nonsorted appearance. They typically appear in clusters and are often reflected in vegetation outlines, making their identification reliant on ecological context.

- **Sorted Nets**  
  Sorted nets serve as a classification for patterned ground that bridges the characteristics of sorted circles and polygons, featuring an intermediate mesh. These nets are crucial for accommodating forms that do not distinctly fall into circular or polygonal categories.

- **Nonsorted Nets**  
  The term nonsorted net refers to patterned ground whose mesh lies between nonsorted circles and nonsorted polygons, lacking a stone boundary. This classification is intended to simplify the understanding and categorization of such forms, which can often be challenging to classify.

- **Earth Hummocks**  
  Earth hummocks are a distinctive type of nonsorted net characterized by a three-dimensional, knob-like shape and a vegetative cover. These features typically form in groups and are associated with specific ecological conditions, predominating in subarctic and alpine environments.

- **Sorted Polygons**  
  Sorted polygons exhibit a predominantly polygonal mesh and a sorted appearance, often surrounded by a border of stones. The classification of these polygons is important as it pertains to understanding their distinctive origins and the processes contributing to their formation.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Sorted Polygons:** Sorted polygons are characterized by their never developing singly, unlike sorted circles. They can range in size from a few centimeters to up to 10 meters across, with their size tending to increase with the severity of climate and water availability.

- **Nonsorted Polygons:** Nonsorted polygons display a predominantly polygonal pattern but lack the distinct border of stones typical of sorted polygons. This category includes various types such as mud-polygons and frost-crack polygons, indicating a range of origins and environmental conditions.

- **Sorted Steps:** Sorted steps are patterned ground features defined by their steplike structure and borders formed by stones that create embankments for finer materials. They typically appear in groups rather than singly, with steps measuring up to 2.4 meters wide and 7.6 meters long.

- **Nonsorted Steps:** Nonsorted steps feature a similar steplike form but are characterized by borders of vegetation instead of stones. These features usually occur in groups and include an earthen core surrounded by humus, moss, and plant roots.

- **Sorted Stripes:** Sorted stripes consist of patterned ground featuring parallel lines of stones with intervening strips of finer material. They form in groups and measure from a few centimeters to over 1.5 meters in width, demonstrating a significant degree of continuity across large distances.

- **Nonsorted Stripes:** Nonsorted stripes resemble sorted stripes but are marked by vegetation-covered ground alongside strips of bare soil. These stripes appear to alternate in width and lack the stone lines characteristic of sorted stripes, often occupying similar spatial relationships.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Local differential heaving**  
  Local differential heaving occurs due to low temperature and may combine with cryostatic movement to form a single continuous system. This phenomenon is responsible for both polygonal and circular patterns on the ground.

- **Cryostatic movement**  
  Cryostatic movement combines with other processes to potentially create unique frozen ground formations. The writer suggests that it is an important factor in explaining patterned ground.

- **Ejection of stones**  
  The ejection of stones, along with gravity movement and other processes, may be crucial in understanding the formation of patterned ground. This suggests a complex interplay of geological forces at play.

- **Solifluction**  
  Solifluction modifies patterns on slopes and plays a key role in shaping the ground. Its interaction with freezing and thawing cycles leads to distinctive surface formations.

- **Circulation due to ice thrusting**  
  After careful review, circulation due to ice thrusting is considered unlikely to be a significant factor in the origin of patterned ground. This conclusion indicates that methods of ground formation may rely on other processes.

- **Weathering processes**  
  Weathering processes such as frost wedging and artesian pressure may be relevant in specific contexts but are not deemed to have widespread significance for patterned ground. A broader understanding of these processes is still considered speculative.

- **Rill work**  
  Rill work, or the processes creating small channels in the soil, is acknowledged but again seen as something largely speculative in this context. They may contribute to surface structure but do not exclusively explain patterned ground genesis.

# Rock Rings [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Rock doughnuts**  
  Rock doughnuts, which are the focus of this discussion, are unique geological features found on granite surfaces. Their formation is related to weather pits and may involve unusual modifications of existing geological processes.

- **Weather pits**  
  These depressions, often called weather pits, have been shaped by the action of rainwater and organic matter over time. They are significant in understanding the natural processes that influence surface formations.

- **Development of annular rims**  
  Some weather pits are surrounded by raised annular rims, lending to their classification as rock doughnuts. These formations are relatively rare and provoke questions about the geological forces at work in their formation.

- **Granite weathering**  
  The weathering of granite, initiated by factors like exfoliation spalling and disintegration, significantly shapes the landscape. This process leads to features like rock doughnuts on surfaces that are exposed to the elements.

- **Induration hypothesis**  
  The induration hypothesis postulates that saturated granite might be altered around weather pits, creating more erosion-resistant structures. This theoretical model proposes a connection between weather pits and the formation of distinct doughnut shapes in the granite.

- **Differential weathering**  
  The concept of differential weathering posits that varying rates of erosion could explain the formation of doughnuts rather than induration. This theory suggests that localized corrosion might produce the observed geological features.

- **Trellis drainage pattern**  
  A trellis drainage pattern might develop near weather pits, potentially leading to the formation of knobs. This hypothesis suggests that the origin of doughnuts could be linked to broader hydrological processes affecting surface shapes.
# Patterned Ground [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Ringlike patterns, bowl-shaped basins, and domical hills**: These formations in the Grandfather Mountain area are found to be more abundant and nearly circular than would be expected without a specific formative process. Their distribution across crystalline rocks suggests a peculiar geological origin related to thick spalls of large diameter.

- **Natural pyramids on a beach**: A series of piles of pebbles on a black sandy beach in the New Hebrides shows a tendency to form low pyramids covered at high tide and exposed at low tide. The pattern has not been observed elsewhere, creating curiosity regarding its geological significance.

- **Striations in gravel bars**: Observed in the Yukon and Porcupine Rivers, these furrows on gravel bars have not been well documented in the literature. Three hypotheses explain their formation, ranging from tree trunks being moved by water to debris held in place by ice.

- **Sine-curve crack in natural ice**: A distinct sine-curve crack was observed on Lake Bohinj in January, revealing a phenomenon that joins the phenomena of cracking ice with tangential tensions. The crack's shape and characteristics raise questions about the underlying mechanical processes during freeze-thaw cycles.

- **Giant desiccation polygons of Great Basin playas**: These massive mudcracks occur in playas within the Basin and Range Province and can be up to 5 meters deep and 300 meters wide. Their formation is attributed to desiccation and shrinkage of clay soils due to drying, creating large polygons across the landscape.

- **Polygonal fracture and fold systems in the salt crust**: The Bonneville salt crust exhibits small folds and fractures believed to derive from the expansion of salt crystals and temperature effects. These polygonal patterns reflect compressional stresses causing the unique geological formations.

- **Ten o'clock marks**: Linear arrangements of sandy-loam soil patterns in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico result from frost action and sunlight exposure, creating distinctive striated surfaces. The orientation of these marks with respect to the sun raises intriguing questions about their underlying mechanisms.

- **Desert gilgai**: These patterned ground formations in northern South Australia, characterized by bare patches and rims of gibber stones, challenge conventional understanding of patterned ground beyond periglacial regions. The interplay of clay soils and hydrology gives rise to these unique geomorphic features.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Variation in Soil Structure**
  There is considerable variation in soil structure, which contradicts previous descriptions by Jessup. This discrepancy suggests the need for further investigation into the local soil conditions.

- **Desert Gilgai Formation**
  The desert gilgai observed in Death Valley, California, formed on gravel fans, indicating a different origin than the Australian counterparts. These features are likely fossil remnants from a previous climatic period.

- **Swelling and Contraction Mechanism**
  Many theories for the formation of gilgai in Australia involve repeated swelling and contraction due to alternating wetting and drying. This is echoed in the desert gilgai formation, supported by the clay content and low-density topsoil.

- **Gibber Movement on Slopes**
  On sloped sites, stones tend to move downhill, leading to the formation of stepped gilgai. Mass movement from the hillside can incorporate gibbers into the subsoil.

- **Alternate Formation and Destruction of Gilgai**
  Observations suggest an ongoing alternation between lag gravel and gilgai formation, which may reach equilibrium with environmental conditions. The theories require long-term observation, which has not yet been conducted.

- **Absence of Complete Lag Gravel Carpet**
  The lack of a complete lag gravel layer in the subsoil indicates potential lateral movement of gibbers. This could involve gibbers falling back towards the center as patches are deflated.

- **Soil Turbulence Indications**
  Jessup’s research hints at possible turbulence in the stony tableland soils, complicating the mechanism of soil formation. Experimentation has indicated that it may involve more complexity than previously thought.

- **Turbulent Flow Within Soil**
  Evidence from Leeper and Hallsworth suggests that the subsoil of gilgai depressions can reach the surface, indicating some turbulent flow within the soil. However, sodium content analysis does not support significant circulation within desert gilgai.

# Linear Sink-Hole Formations [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Linear Sink-Hole Patterns**
  Recently discovered straight line sink-holes in southeastern New Mexico are manifestations of ground-water dissolving action. These sink-holes vary in size, some reaching diameters of over 1,800 feet and are connected by trenches that may also result from solution processes.

- **Branching Sink-Hole Patterns**
  In addition to linear arrangements, some areas exhibit branching patterns of connected basins. This suggests integration of separate drainage channels into a cohesive system due to ground-water action.

# Curiosities of Coal [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Uniform Thickness of Coalbeds**
  Coalbeds present remarkable uniformity in thickness across vast areas, posing challenges for traditional theories of in-situ formation. This striking consistency indicates a complex process influencing coal deposition over large regions.

- **Cyclothem Sequences**
  The presence of cyclothems, where similar sequences of strata repeat numerous times, raises intriguing questions about the conditions under which these deposits formed. The regularity of these patterns may indicate significant geological processes at work over time.

- **Erratic Boulder Encounters**
  Miners often discover erratic boulders within coal seams, challenging assumptions about their transport mechanisms to these deposits. The occurrence of such rocks raises questions, particularly regarding the feasibility of ice rafting in tropical environments.

- **Upright Fossil Trees in Coalbeds**
  The presence of upright fossil trees penetrating some coalbeds indicates rapid accumulation of plant material, potentially faster than decay processes could occur. This situation presents inconsistencies with traditional views of coal formation timelines.

- **Underclay Structures**
  Coal underclays, often containing root-like structures, call into question the sustainability of forests that eventually turned into coal layers. The juxtaposition of these formations suggests a more complex ecosystem than commonly assumed.

# Erratic Rocks in Coal Seams [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Historical Reports of Fragments**
  Fragmented rocks embedded within coal beds have historically puzzled geologists regarding their origins. Such observations date back to the 19th century, indicating isolated instances of various rock types appearing within coal.

- **Water-Worn Rocks in Coal**
  Instances of water-worn rock fragments embedded in coal raise questions regarding their transport and deposition. The smoothness of some of these fragments suggests they traveled significant distances before becoming part of coal formations.

- **Diverse Fragment Origins**
  Numerous reports indicate fragments found in coal originate from various geological formations. Many of these rocks appear water-worn, challenging notions of their transportation and highlighting the complexity of coal formation environments.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Transport of Trees to Deep Water**  
  The concept of floating a large tree to deep water presents several logistical challenges. Trees grow on land, and transferring them without the aid of torrents or a suitable topography is nearly impossible.

- **Misconception of Shale Deposits**  
  The assumption that shales, sandstones, and conglomerates are necessarily deposited in deep water lacks definitive evidence. The writer argues that the Appalachian Coal Measures indicate these formations are flood-plain deposits rather than evidence of deep-water conditions.

- **Presence of Boulder Fragments in Coal**  
  Boulder fragments found in coal seams, notably in Ohio, challenge conventional geological understanding. These fragments, while occasionally reported, have not been satisfactorily explained or universally observed across different geological settings.

- **Regularity of Jointing in Coal Beds**  
  The study of jointing within Ohio's coal beds reveals a noticeable regularity in their trend. These joints have two distinct sets and align closely with the Appalachian folds, suggesting they were influenced by tectonic forces rather than simply by the physical properties of coal.

- **Accumulation of Vegetable Matter**  
  The accumulation of vegetable matter in Illinois coal beds shows conspicuous stratification and alternating laminae. This feature raises questions about the conditions under which the coals formed, particularly concerning the many layers and the presence of mineral charcoal.

- **Slate Binders in the Pittsburgh Coal Bed**  
  The existence of thin slate binders within the Pittsburgh coal bed poses intriguing questions about their origin and significance. Their extensive geographical distribution and uniformity challenge existing explanations of coal formation processes in that region.

- **Anomalous Fire Clay Occurrence**  
  The presence of fireclays, such as those in the Coal Measures, raises questions regarding their formation. Some beds of fire clay exist independently of coal seams, while others are of better quality, presenting inconsistencies with the standard explanation of fire clay as residual soil from vegetation that formed coal.
# Curiosities of Coal [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Carbon Oxidation and Erosion**  
  This anomaly indicates that the carbon within coal seams might have been oxidized due to prolonged exposure before being covered by sediments. Alternatively, the carbonaceous material could have been eroded prior to the deposition of the overlying stratum.

- **Refractory Clays**  
  Observations suggest that clays occurring free from coal seams tend to be more refractory than those lying beneath them. This phenomenon may stem from both greater original purity and leaching processes following land elevation.

- **Thickness of Clay Beds**  
  Clay deposits sometimes exceed thirty feet in thickness, raising questions about how vegetation could extract iron and alkalies from such a substantial clay mass. Interestingly, although one might expect the upper portions to be purer, it is often the lower parts that prove to be the best quality clay.

- **Coal Without Under Clay**  
  While coal is generally underlain by clay, there are instances where no clay layer exists at all. This occurrence possibly implies that some fireclays are better understood as clays that were transported prior to deposition, deviating from the traditional view of their formation in situ.

# Polystrates in Coal [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Fossil Reptilian Remains**  
  At South Joggins, the well-preserved carboniferous strata display numerous fossil forests and rootbeds, challenging previous assumptions about the relationships between certain fossilized plants. Particularly, upright Sigillariae observed with their roots demonstrate significant geological implications about ancient vegetation and sedimentation processes.

- **Root-Bearing Soils**  
  At various levels within the 1400-foot thickness of strata, rootbeds provide crucial evidence of ancient terrestrial surfaces. Coal seams' resistance to erosion might be bolstered by roots, which became coal, effectively stabilizing the saturated layers above them, unlike the weaker sandy or muddy layers.

- **Hollow Cylinder Structures**  
  The examination of fossil trees indicated that they were reduced to hollow cylinders, which were later filled with drifting plant debris during inundations. This suggests that conditions allowed for remarkable preservation of tree structures even amidst considerable sediment deposition.

# Rates of Sedimentation in the Lancashire Coal Measures [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Fossilized Trees and Rapid Sedimentation**  
  The discovery of fossilized trees preserved in a growth position indicates that these plants were rapidly buried by sediment before extensive decomposition occurred. Such findings reflect that numerous fossilized trees in Lancashire are associated with significant and rapid sedimentation events.

- **Inundation Mechanism**  
  The sediment surrounding fossilized trees suggests an inundation mechanism where floodwaters brought considerable sediment, leading to the preservation of these upright growths. In contrast, trees found in slower accumulating sediments likely decayed and collapsed before they could be buried adequately.

# Fusain, Mineral Charcoal, Mother-of-Coal [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Origin of Mother of Coal**  
  The substance known as "Mother of Coal" has primarily been interpreted as charred wood remnants or woody structures that escaped carbonification processes. Its association with flattened spores indicates these coals likely originated from sedimentary deposits in open water rather than peat transformations.

- **Transportation of Mineral Charcoal**  
  The prevailing theory attributes mineral charcoal formation to charred plant material resulting from fires, which was then distributed by streams into coal basins. This assumption faces scrutiny due to the logistical challenges of maintaining so much charred material amidst sedimentation processes.

- **Exposure Effects**  
  An alternative theory proposes that mineral charcoal arises from partial atmospheric decay of the surface of accumulating vegetation rather than through burning. This perspective aligns better with observed patterns in the coal's laminae structure and associated plant remains.

# Coal Jelly [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Discovery of Coal Jelly**  
  The finding of a jelly-like carbonaceous substance during courthouse excavations in Scranton highlights an unusual geological occurrence within a former swamp area. This material, possessing a gelatinous nature, solidifies upon slow drying and closely resembles anthracite coal in appearance.

- **Vein Coal**  
  The occurrence of coal in a deep cut on the B.&O. Railroad suggests unusual conditions accompanying its deposition. This coal is found only in pockets at the contact between the sandstone and shale, indicating it is not due to subsequent erosion but rather an original character.

- **Stylolites with Films of Coal**  
  The rare occurrence of stylolites in non-carbonate rocks has been observed, particularly in quartzitic sandstone from Alabama, containing thin black coal films. These stylolites are significant for their structural relations and suggest evidence supporting the solution theory of origin.

- **The Albert Coal, or Albertite, of New Brunswick**  
  The nature of the Albert coal and its occurrence have posed vexed questions in geology, characterized by an irregular vein rather than beds. The coal exhibits various peculiarities in its mining properties, including significant lateral shifts and variations in thickness, challenging established theories about coal deposits.
# Stratigraphic Anomalies  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **The Albert coal occurs in true cutting veins, not in sedimentary beds like ordinary coal.** This suggests a unique formation process compared to typical coal deposits. The presence of these true veins alters the understanding of how coal can be found in geological strata. 

- **The Albert coal was originally in a liquid state, was injected into vertical fissures, and subsequently hardened into a substance resembling jet.** This process indicates that the liquid may have derived from either vegetable accumulations or ichthyic remains in adjacent shales. The change in state from liquid to solid, influenced by oxygen interaction, showcases an unusual formation phenomenon.

- **The Albert coal must be compared with the asphaltic and bituminous veins found in the Quebec group in Canada.** Unlike standard coal beds, these materials fill veins and fissures that cut through various rock types rather than forming in traditional layers. The differing characteristics of these veins suggest significant variability in coal formation across regions.

- **These carbonaceous veins are analogous to veins of petroleum.** Successful petroleum extraction in areas like Ohio and Western Virginia occurs along lines of fracture, particularly along anticlinal axes. The findings underscore similarities and potential interdependencies between carbonaceous materials and petroleum deposits.

- **The carbonaceous veins, such as the Albert coal and Canadian asphalt, differ from metallic lodes.** Ongoing exploration for petroleum highlights the need to understand these differences, which can impact mining strategies and definitions of mineral types. A correct interpretation of these carbonaceous veins can necessitate alterations in geological terminology.

Their inconsistent shapes and fossil content highlight the diverse processes involved in coal bed formation.

- **Coal balls, once thought to be confined to a single horizon, have since been discovered across multiple coal beds.** Their irregular distribution suggests there's no predictable relationship in their occurrence between different coal layers. The variety in size and shape of these coal balls presents a fascinating aspect of coal bed geology.

- **The roof shale of coal beds commonly contains abundant remains of marine animals alongside plant material.** The distinct nodules found within the shale are characteristic and enrich the fossil record of these deposits. The juxtaposition of marine and terrestrial remains raises intriguing questions about ecological interconnections during the coal formation processes.

- **Sphaerosiderites, resembling English roof balls, have been identified within marine shales.** While these nodules often contain marine shells, they lack definitive characteristics seen in other fossiliferous structures. Their existence emphasizes the complexity of paleoenvironments represented in coal measures.

- **The coal balls and sphaerosiderites show different preservation states of plant materials, indicating varied formation processes.** In coal balls, plant material tends to be well-preserved and uncompressed, whereas in roof balls, it may be degraded. This disparity underscores the varying environmental conditions influencing fossil preservation.

# Dinosaur Tracks in the Roofs of Coal Mines [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Observations of ancient dinosaur tracks from beneath coal seams provide a unique perspective on Cretaceous life.** Specific protuberances emerging from coal seam roofs have been identified as potential tracks of ancient dinosaurs. The formations likely originated when heavy animals walked over soft peat covered by sediment.

- **The tracks made by these ancient creatures were likely visible where the coal seams have separated from the roof layers.** As peat transformed into coal over time, the sediment-filled footprints became rock formations, still retaining their original shapes. The detail observable in these tracks resembles those of large theropod dinosaurs walking on hind feet.

- **The largest dinosaur tracks found in the coal mines exceed known dinosaur footprints from mounted skeletons, suggesting unknown species.** The extensive examination of these tracks has led paleontologists to theorize about the enormous size of the dinosaurs that made them, positing they might belong to relatives of the Tyrannosaurus. The implications of such findings challenge existing understandings of dinosaur morphology and habits.

- **Fatal Ravine**: The fatal ravine on Cache Creek, located a short distance from notable attractions, is seldom visited due to its lack of hunting opportunities and general appeal. An old elk trail provides access to a depression that was once a hot spring pool but is now dry, characterized by a crust of salt that attracts local wildlife.

- **Shallow Depression**: The center of a meadow features a shallow depression where an ancient hot spring once thrived. This area is now dry and covered with salt efflorescence, which draws elk and other game into the vicinity.

- **Hot Spring Deposits**: The banks of Cache Creek are adorned with ancient hot spring deposits that have been polished by water action, resulting in a glass-like surface. The remnants of hot spring activity include a partially washed-away cone and altered travertine, showcasing the region's geothermal history.

- **Cold Boiling Water**: A deep pool in the creek demonstrates vigorous gas emissions that create the appearance of boiling water, despite the water being quite cold. This phenomenon is attributed to an excessive release of gases, including carbonic acid and hydrogen sulfide, which also contributes to the turbidity of the water.

- **Sulphurous Gas Accumulation**: Above the deposits, there is a bank of sulphur cemented with gravel, leading into a lateral gulley with a clear cold stream. The gas emanating from the area, possibly containing sulphuric acid, causes the backdrop to be steep, formed from decomposed volcanic rock.

- **Death of Local Wildlife**: Various animal remains, including bears and small mammals, were found in a basin indicative of asphyxiation likely caused by inhaling noxious gases. The lack of violence marks these deaths, suggesting a slow suffocation rather than an immediate cause of injury.

- **Gas Accumulation**: The flat nature of the ravine allows gases to accumulate in pockets, potentially leading to animal fatalities as they become entrapped in denser gas layers. This mechanism suggests a long history as a death trap for wildlife attracted to the area.

- **Rate of Gas Emission**: While volcanic regions frequently experience gas emissions, these can vary from temporary to permanent sources. Examples include the deadly gases from Vesuvius and other locations that have historically led to mass animal fatalities due to suffocation from accumulating gases.

# Methane from the Bowels of the Earth [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Gold's Outgassing Theory**: Professor Gold presented a theory that outgassing is essential for understanding the Earth's carbon deposits, suggesting that gases have steadily leaked from the crust due to heat and pressure since the planet's formation. He argued that much of the carbon seen today results from this process, leading to substantial quantities of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.

- The concept of the "mother rock" in petroleum formation requires critical proof of its potential to generate petroleum, challenging the organic theory's dominance. This suggests that previously accepted notions may need reevaluation in light of new findings.

- Anticlinal structures must be understood as vertical pathways for petroleum migration, rather than a horizontal inflow model. This perspective alters the fundamental understanding of how oil accumulates in geological formations.

- Investigations into petroleum formation have shown that years of exclusively following organic theory have led to unfruitful outcomes, as noted by Hedberg's observations of unresolved scientific queries. This highlights the need for a shift in research focus towards developing new theories in petroleum geology.

- The present understanding of petroleum demands necessitates innovative and imaginative exploration strategies that discern between proven truths and speculative ideas. Such an approach is essential for the discovery of new petroleum reserves.

- The inorganic theory presents a framework for exploring petroleum in basement rocks but has yet to be fully adopted in exploration practices. The existence of hydrocarbon accumulations in crystalline rocks indicates potential for further study in this area.

- Significant quantities of hydrocarbons found in ancient shales contradict the inorganic theory. The variance in hydrocarbon content associated with shale coloration suggests a more complex origin of petroleum than the inorganic theory can sufficiently explain.

- Studies have shown that a notable portion of sandstones in the Athabasca region are too fine-grained for typical fluid flow mechanisms. This raises questions about how oil can accumulate in these sandstones without contradicting established geological principles.

- Indicators such as porphyrins and sulfur suggest a low-temperature origin for petroleum rather than an inorganic process. This points towards the necessity of considering biological influences in the formation of oil.

- The stratification of carbon isotopes within crude oils challenges the inorganic hypothesis, indicating different geological processes at play. The variations in oil composition from various reservoirs cannot be adequately accounted for by the proposed inorganic formation mechanisms.

- The presence of diverse microscopic organic debris within oils suggests they were not transported through deep faults as proponents of the inorganic theory suggest. This diversity indicates a more complex history of oil formation and accumulation.

- Core studies reveal that hydrocarbon presence decreases with depth, counter to what would be expected if petroleum were results of an inorganic origin. This discrepancy necessitates a reevaluation of the models explaining the genesis of oil reserves.

- Evidence for ancient oil accumulations exists in geological descriptions of certain fields, supporting the idea that traditional petroleum theories may need reconsideration. These observations could enrich models of petroleum formation and migration.

- Porphyrins and other organic indicators found in Athabasca oilsands imply a closer relation to biological processes than previously thought. This underscores the importance of organic contributions to oil formation.

- The presence of relatively high amounts of porphyrins and terpenes in certain deposits challenges the notion of an exclusively inorganic origin. These findings prompt a reevaluation of the sources of oil within different geological formations.

- The geological consistency and absence of large-scale faults in the Athabasca region raise doubts about long-distance oil migration theories. This suggests that the oil formations are more likely to be resultant from local origins rather than from distant geologic sources.
# Curious Occurrences of Petroleum [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Hydrocarbon Fluid Inclusions in Quartz**

- **Peculiar Phases of Oil Saturation in Certain Sandstones**  
  There is only one known deposit of oil acting as a solid body interbedded in sediments in the U.S., specifically near Great Salt Lake. This unique occurrence is explained as oil arriving in sediment form, suggesting unconventional petroleum accumulation methods.

- **Salt Structures and Evaporites**  
  The vast amounts of subterranean salt around the Gulf of Mexico suggest extensive geological processes that led to the drying of oceans. The existence of various evaporites necessitates an explanation for the environmental changes that have occurred over geological time, including significant fluctuations in sea level.
# SALTSTRUCTURES OF GULFOFMEXICO BASIN-A REVIEW [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly 1**: Diapiric salt structures are unknown on higher parts of large structural anomalies in the Gulf of Mexico basin. Their absence indicates either thinness or absence of salt, attributed to non-deposition of sodium chloride or regional flowage of salt to lower elevations.

- **Anomaly 2**: Salt structures are also absent in the carbonate platforms of Florida, the Bahamas, and most of Yucatan. This absence is similarly explained by a lack of significant sedimentary deposition or salt flow to these regions.

- **Anomaly 3**: Salt diapirs in the Gulf region differ greatly in geometry and growth patterns from those found in the Zechstein basin of Germany. Unlike the relatively better-developed great salt anticlines and ridges in the Gulf basin, those in the Zechstein basin display different formations such as droplet types and salt walls.

# THE DAY THE MEDD DRIED UP [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly 4**: The thickness of evaporite deposits poses a problem, as the evaporation of 1000 feet of seawater leaves only about 15 feet of salt. This discrepancy suggests that the geological processes responsible for the thick salt layers must have involved significantly more seawater than is currently present in the Mediterranean.

- **Anomaly 5**: The existing salt deposits show signs of having been deposited in shallow waters, contradicting their current depth of about 5000 feet below sea level. Moreover, the interbedding of these deposits with deep-water foraminifera indicates several cycles of evaporation and refilling.

# SALT DIAPIRISM IN SOUTHERN IRAN [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly 6**: The presence of piercement salt plugs in southern Iran, known for their tongue-like projections and associated exotic blocks, represents a significant geological anomaly. These diapirs, often associated with anticlines, rise dramatically above the valley floor and suggest complex geological processes at play.

- **Anomaly 7**: There have been at least two distinct periods of salt mobilization and intrusion recognized in the Hormuz diapirs. These include a pre-Zagros phase, possibly dating back to the Triassic period, and a late Tertiary phase related to orogenic events.

# ABYSSAL OIL? [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Uneven Distribution of Bays**: The bays are scattered irregularly over the flat surface, with no discernible pattern or relationship to the coastline. Their varying positions raise questions about their formation and spatial arrangement.

- **Challenges of Wind Action Theory**: Sand ridges' attribution to wind action is questioned, as this would imply a lack of vegetation that is not evident. Additionally, any dunes formed by wind should be found on the sides opposite the bays, contradicting current observations.

- **Absence of Old Stream Channels**: No remains of ancient stream channels that would logically enter the bays have been found. This further complicates theories regarding the bays' origins, particularly concerning their irregular distribution towards the coastline.

- **Similarity to Coastal Sounds**: A comparison between the bays and the coastal sounds suggests that bays might be smaller versions of the sounds created through similar sedimentary processes. The sediment infilling these areas indicates a gradual evolutionary process.

- **Old Shoreline Features**: It is hypothesized that when the region was above sea level, it left behind irregularities resembling pittings created by surface watershed. These features may have served as basins for the creation of the bays.

- **Concerns with Origin Theories**: The theory suggesting a meteoritic origin faces objections, especially regarding the lack of observable old channel deposits. Moreover, the irregular shapes and distributions of the bays pose more questions than are answered.

- **Elliptical Shape of Bays**: The prevalent rounded or elliptical shapes of the bays remain unexplained, challenging existing models of formation. If these shapes are a result of ancient marine activity, concrete evidence is still lacking.

- **Lack of Recent Formation Evidence**: Current observations indicate that no new bays are forming, undermining the ongoing natural processes believed to create such features. This challenges the validity of existing models explaining the formation of the Carolina Bays.

- **Variation in Data Collection**: Surveys indicate areas in North Carolina have high concentrations of bays. More than 50% of surface coverage in certain regions suggests substantial geological features but raises questions about detected overlap between bay formations.

- **Geomagnetic Anomalies**: All magnetometer surveys of the bays reveal associated spot magnetic highs. These high readings are consistently located near the southeastern end of the bays, adhering to what is referred to as the "Prouty Rule."

- **Linear Magnetic Features**: In some coastal plain areas, linear magnetic highs complicate the analysis of observed magnetic data. This variability suggests underlying geological complexities that warrant further investigation.

- **Rim Composition**: The sand in the rim of the bays tends to be coarser than average, consistent with most theories regarding their formation. The differences in sand grain dynamics could further explain the structural integrity and features of the rim.

- **Lack of Disturbance Beneath Rims**: There is minimal stratification in the rim sand, implying undisturbed formations. Any hypothesized “pipes” or areas of disturbed ground beneath the bays remain to be verified.

- **Absence of Expected Materials**: Notably absent from the bays are metallic fragments or glass that would typically accompany meteoritic events. The porous soil conditions diminish the likelihood of their presence.

- **Pleistocene Terraces**: The bays originated on the sandy Pleistocene terraces of the coastal plain and are generally younger than associated beach ridges. This indicates a sequence of geomorphological changes where the bays cut across prior sedimentary features.

- **Marine Encroachment**: There is evidence that sea levels have intermittently invaded the bays since their formation, contributing marine sediments. Such dynamics can complicate the understanding of the region's historical geography.

- **Presence of Springs**: A few bays are associated with lakebottom springs, primarily found near the southeastern ends. These springs indicate unusual hydrological features for the areas, adding another layer of complexity to bay formations.

- **Peat Composition**: Significantly, most of the bays are filled with peat, which can reach depths of 15 to 30 feet. The weight and density of the peat affect the water table elevation surrounding the bays, guiding the ecological characteristics of the area.
# Distribution, Coverage, Number, and Grouping of Carolina Bays [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The Carolina Bays are geographically confined to the Atlantic Coastal Plain and a few coastal plain outliers. The large majority of these depressions are found in South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina.

- Concentration of large bays is more pronounced in certain localities as opposed to small bays. However, in general, there is a fairly uniform mixing of sizes throughout the distribution.

- Multiple overlapping bays can be seen in an elongated northwest-southeast line, forming what are referred to as "multiple bays." Elsewhere, broad, heart-shaped configurations can occur due to overlapping.

- Even in extreme northeastern Florida and the Chesapeake Bay region, very few scattered bays can be located. Additionally, about three or four questionable bays exist in New Jersey.

- Some bays have formed in lowland areas and river bottoms, while skeleton bays and partially destroyed ones can be found along the banks of the Cape Fear River. There are also instances of bays projecting across waterways, partially concealed by river swamps.

- The first visible bays going inland from Myrtle Beach show signs of partial destruction due to wave action. This indicates that the bays were likely formed in shallow water along the coastline before being partially destroyed.

- Partial destruction of bay rims has been observed in various coastal areas and in locations several miles inland. Findings from plant remains in contemporary coastal swamps support the theory of a relatively recent advance and retreat of the sea in parts of the Carolinas.

# The Origin of the Carolina Bays and the Oriented Lakes of Alaska [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The origin of the Carolina Bays and the Oriented Lakes of Northern Alaska has sparked considerable scientific intrigue. Initial theories attributed them to a gigantic shower of meteorites, eliciting widespread press attention upon their discovery.

- Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain these geomorphic features, but none have fulfilled all requirements satisfactorily. The striking similarities between the Carolina Bays and the Oriented Lakes have also been noted, at least in part.

- Cosmic collision is presented as a significant energy force that may explain the formation of the Carolina Bays and many other physical features on Earth. This includes evidence of past catastrophes and significant geological changes recorded throughout history.

- Major Chapman Grant noted features such as gravel hills that do not intersect with the bays, which differ from typical lake formations. Such observations challenge the meteorite impact theory, especially regarding the arrangement of the bays.

- Chains of nearly touching bays have been identified, suggesting a possible origin from a single large iceberg fragmenting. This occurrence raised questions about the likelihood of meteorites falling in such an ordered fashion.

- The final melting of ice likely occurred without substantial currents, leading to delicate sand rims around the bays. This process improved the symmetry of the bays, resulting from the shapes and positioning of icebergs during melting.
# Anomalies in the Origin of Carolina Bays [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Meteorite Hypothesis Objection**: Johnson argues that the presence of oval basins and sandy rims in the Myrtle Beach area prior to the beach ridges' construction would have resulted in their annihilation. This assertion is contingent on the rate of relative sea level change, which remains uncertain.

- **Formation Order of Features**: Johnson states that beach ridges and depressions are early features of the old shore zone, implying that the bays developed later influenced by these features. Contrarily, it can be posited that the bays existed first, affecting the location of the beach ridges.

- **Elliptical Crater Formation**: Johnson suggests that large meteorites impacting at oblique angles cannot produce elliptical craters; instead, he argues that they create round craters. However, evidence from Meteor Crater shows an elliptical shape formed due to impact dynamics, contradicting Johnson's claim.

- **Size Relations in Crater Formation**: According to Johnson, large meteorites should leave craters proportional to their size; he posits that a meteorite explosion upon impact would result in a larger crater. However, studies of Meteor Crater show that the meteorite was smaller than the resulting crater, challenging this assumption.

- **Need for Subsurface Investigations**: Johnson's theory of complex origin relies on geologic conditions that may not exist, suggesting the current insufficient critical specifications for a satisfactory theory of the Carolina Bays’ origin. This indicates a necessity for further subsurface investigations to yield a conclusive explanation of their formation.
# Climate [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The climate on the Arctic slope is characterized as cloudy, cold, arid, and windy. Monthly and annual climatic data collected at Barrow since 1912 are likely applicable to the entire coastal area.

# Geology [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Arctic Coastal Plain is underlain by several thousand feet of relatively impervious sandstones, shales, and interbedded conglomerates. These rocks are mostly flat-lying and have experienced gentle folding that produced low domes and anticlines.

# Permafrost [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- All surficial deposits and the bedrock beneath the Arctic slope are permanently frozen, containing large quantities of ice in various forms. Summer thaw penetrates from 6 inches to a maximum of about 30 inches, with an average summer thaw of 8-20 inches.

# Description of the Oriented Lakes Distribution [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The oriented lakes are completely concentrated in the Arctic Coastal Plain Province of northern Alaska, extending from the Arctic Ocean to the boundary with the Plateaus Province. The maximum width of this area is more than 100 miles, while the average width is between 50 and 80 miles.

# Concentration [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Oriented lakes are found in elongated belts or zones, estimated to comprise between less than 25 percent to as much as 90 percent of the land's surface. The number of oriented lakes is markedly less along the southern boundary of the area, particularly in regions of higher relief and coarser-grained surficial deposits.

# Orientation [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The parallel orientation of thousands of elongated lakes in the Arctic Coastal Plain is a rare phenomenon, similar in notable degree to the Carolina Bays. This remarkable alignment has been utilized as a guide in air navigation.

# Character of the Oriented Lakes [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Oriented lakes vary greatly in size, from small ponds to large lakes over 9 miles long and 3 miles wide. Lakes are significantly less numerous and smaller towards the southern boundary of the Coastal Plain compared to areas near the coast.

# Comparison of the Oriented Lakes of Northern Alaska with the Carolina Bays and Other Oriented Lakes [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- This paper presents the first significant description of a group of oriented lakes comparable in number and extent with the Carolina Bays in the eastern United States. The site of the Carolina Bays has been previously unique in containing such well-oriented lakes.

# Theories of Origin of the Oriented Lakes [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Theories regarding the origin of oriented lakes in northern Alaska suggest that they may result from thawing perennially frozen ground, also known as cave-in lakes. Prevailing winds along the axis of the lakes are believed to significantly influence their orientation.
# Carolina Bays [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Oriented Lakes**: Oriented lakes in the Beni basin cover roughly 45,000 square miles and are located where the water table is near the surface. They have specific distribution patterns, often concentrated along alluviated areas.
  
- **Orientation and Physical Characteristics**: Most lakes in the Beni basin show axis-aligned shorelines, trending between N.45°E and N.45°W. The size of these lakes varies significantly, with some over 12 miles long and others less than 1,000 feet square.

# Some Observations on the So-Called "Lakes" of the Llano Estacado of Texas [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Classifications of Lakes**: The depressions termed "lakes" are categorized into three classes based on their shape, depth, and arrangement, with one being linear depressions up to three miles long. The origins of these features are linked to gravitational processes and the dissolution of underlying Permian strata.

- **Factors Influencing Lake Formation**: It is believed that differential compaction and slumping due to the solution of underlying material significantly contribute to the formation of these lakes. Additionally, climatic conditions lead to the development of broad, flat valleys that are prone to interruption.

# Pockmarks and Craterlets [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Craterlets Due to the New Madrid Earthquake**: Six craterlets near the New Madrid fault are believed to be remnants of seismic activity, extending the area of destructiveness beyond established boundaries. These craters vary in size but share a common origin linked to the earthquake.

- **Characteristics and Origin of Craterlets**: Most craterlets are saucer-shaped, with diameters between 10 and 40 feet, some featuring a double structure. Assumed causes include subterranean pressures forcing material upward, though their exact age remains undetermined.

- **Small Sandcraters of Seismic Origin**: Created following the Ecuador earthquake, these small sand craters were formed by the ejection of water and sand through fissures in the earth. Reports indicate that this simultaneously coincided with the movement of tectonic structures.

# Explaining the North Sea's Lunar Floor [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Unique Topography**: An extensive region in the North Sea showcases crater-like features resembling a miniature lunar landscape, which has raised questions regarding their formation. These pockmarks vary in size and depth and are typically formed in sedimentary layers.

- **Geological Studies and Findings**: Ongoing geological surveys in the area have identified thousands of pockmarks, leading to statistical studies on their distribution and characteristics. Results reveal patterns of elongation and alignments that may relate to tidal currents.

# Pockmarks on the Scotian Shelf [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Characteristics of Pockmarks**: Pockmarks on the Scotian Shelf present cone-shaped depressions with specific ranges in diameter and depth, thought to result from subsurface gas or water seepage. Their formation suggests a dynamic geological environment influenced by gas migration.

# Modern Biogenic Gas-Generated Craters (Seafloor "Pockmarks") on the Bering Shelf, Alaska [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Crater Density**: The Bering Sea floor contains numerous craters associated with biogenic methane accumulation, with significant concentrations observed. Covering more than 20,000 km², the structures are indicative of underlying gas charges influencing sediment behavior.

- **Formation Processes**: These craters are actively forming due to trapped gases escaping, particularly during storm events, which disrupt the sediment layers above. The associated peat mud contains large organic carbon percentages, supporting these processes.

# Certain Natural Pits in the Neighborhood of Ripon [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Obscure Origin of Pits**: Numerous natural pits around Ripon are characterized by their crater-like formation in the New Red Sandstone and overlying drift-gravel. Their connections to water action and geological stability remain enigmatic.

- **Notable Occurrences**: Several pits have been formed in recent history, with reports of noise and subsequent formations being tied to subsurface collapses. The pits exhibit unique structures, sometimes filled with water, presenting challenges in elucidating their formation dynamics. 

# That Wiltshire Crater [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Notable Visual Features**: A notable crater discovered in Wiltshire is characterized by its 8-foot depression amid a potato field and a central hole suggesting some form of impact. Observations noted the presence of spurs extending from the main crater, hinting at dynamic prior activity.

- **Speculated Origins**: The crater has sparked various theories, ranging from bomb-related events to extraterrestrial impacts, with the latter being dismissed upon closer investigation. Despite extensive examination, the precise cause of formation remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate.
# Anomalies in the Crater [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Meteoritic Origin**: The crater was initially thought to be of meteoric origin, but further investigations concluded that the object was not a meteorite of any kind. This led to speculation about the surrounding flattened wheat areas and their connection to potential violent air currents.

- **Bomb Disposal Investigation**: Authorities concluded that there was no bomb involved, which diminished their interest in the crater. As a result, peace returned to the area, prompting a reevaluation of what the crater truly was.

- **Natural Subsidence**: Although natural subsidence was a possible cause for the crater, it did not appear to give that impression given the surrounding flattened wheat areas. The association of these areas with the crater indicated they might have been formed by a common event.

- **Artificial Satellite Hypothesis**: The falling body that caused the crater was speculated to be a piece of an artificial satellite. However, this explanation seemed improbable, as no aircraft were reported missing at the time.

- **Odd Radiating Spurs**: The presence of radiating spurs was noted as peculiar, particularly because the crater was located in a potato field that had been dug in various directions. This feature led to the possibility of an impact opening up old furrows in the agricultural landscape.

- **Unidentified Trace Material**: An attempt to find traces of meteoritic material in the crater was unsuccessful, leading to doubts about a meteoric impact. The absence of such material raised questions about the crater’s true origin.

- **Possible Hoax**: Although a hoax was suggested as a potential explanation for the crater, the author deemed this highly improbable. The lack of supporting evidence for such a theory made it less credible than other hypotheses. 

# Anomalies in the Tiffin Hole [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Unusual Hole Found**: A peculiar hole was discovered near Tiffin, Iowa, which was suspected not to have been made by a buffalo as traditional belief suggested. Hydraulic engineering experts found that the hole did not result from normal stream flow or erosion processes.

- **Consideration of Sinkhole Origin**: Although the possibility of the hole being a sinkhole was evaluated, it was found that bedrock lay more than 100 feet below it. Any such geological activity would not logically lead to the formation of this specific hole given the surrounding topography.

- **Jam of Driftwood**: Experts considered that a jam of driftwood could have created the hole, but investigations showed that any temporary changes made by driftwood did not result in a lasting depression. The area eventually returned to its original condition, negating this theory.

- **Possible Artificial Origin**: The notion that the hole was man-made was contemplated but dismissed since there was no reason to excavate such a hole in that particular location. Furthermore, it held no value as a water reservoir, being dry most of the time.

- **Meteoritic Origin Debate**: The elliptical shape of the hole was similar to known meteoric craters, and soil borings revealed layers rich in iron oxide. However, surrounding areas did not show such concentrations, raising skepticism about the meteoric theory.

- **Absence of Nickel**: Recent soil tests indicated a presence of iron but a lack of nickel, which countered the idea of a meteoric origin. Without nickel, a commonly found element in meteoritic materials, the likelihood of it being formed by a meteor was significantly reduced.

- **Swirl-Pit Theory**: Compared to other explanations, the swirl-pit theory described features created during powerful floods, which were thought to account for the Tiffin hole's characteristics. Although some objections remained, notably the noticeable rim, overall evidence supported this flood-related origin.

# Geophysical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Evolution of Impact Studies**: Initially, geologists were skeptical about the formation of depressions on Earth due to meteoritic impacts. This shifted dramatically in the late 20th century as more craters were identified, spurred by spacecraft observations of other celestial bodies.

- **Identification of Terrestrial Impacts**: A growing recognition in the 1960s and 1970s led to the discovery of many earthbound impact structures, explained by evidence gathered through photographs and geological surveys. This marked a notable shift in scientific understanding, accepting that Earth had also experienced significant impacts.

- **Cryptovolcanism vs. Impact Cratering**: The study of cryptovolcanic features prompted researchers to reconsider the origins of geological structures, speculating that some might actually be results of meteoritic impacts instead of volcanic activity. This was based on evidence of explosive action not aligned with the age of the surrounding rocks.

- **Geophysical Investigations**: In the 1950s, concerted efforts were made to assess potential impact sites through extensive geophysical measurements. Such studies offered novel insights into craters' depths and geological compositions, revealing layers of shock-metamorphosed materials.

- **Recognition of Shock Indicators**: The advancement of examining shatter cones, minerals, and impact melts provided concrete evidence of past impacts on Earth. Identifiable features, such as central uplifts in craters, showcased how geological formations could tell tales of ancient impacts.

- **Impact Craters Identification Criteria**: Scientists developed various criteria to distinguish between actual impact craters and other geological structures. The presence of meteorites, general circular forms, and certain mineralogical evidence were key factors in identifying true impact sites.

- **Impacts of Meteorite Composition**: The essence of studying meteoritic composition in impact sites became crucial in understanding their formation. Insights into how meteoritic materials are dispersed and physically altered by the impact process highlighted the complexity of assessing such craters.
# POPIGAY DEPRESSION: ASIBERIAN ASTROBLEME?   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Popigay Depression is a circular feature about 45 miles in diameter, located in the Khatanga river basin. Initially thought to be a result of collapse 100 million years ago, Soviet scientists suggested it may have been formed by the impact of a large extraterrestrial object around 30 million years ago.  

# SUDBURY STRUCTURE ASANASTROBLEME   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Sudbury structure is interpreted as a 1.7-billion-year-old asteroid impact structure created by a significant energy event. This impact led to the formation of a crater approximately 30 miles across and 2 miles deep, with preserved remnants of the bolide converted to sulfides along the crater wall.  

# INVESTIGATION OFTHEMANICOUAGAN IMPACT CRATER   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Manicouagan ring structure in Quebec, Canada, is heavily cratered and 65 km in diameter, offering significant insights into the processes of impact melting. It features inhomogeneous melt rocks that suggest a complex interaction of superheated silicate liquids and cold clasts during its formation.  

# VREDEFORT RINGSTRUCTURE: METEORITE IMPACT SCAR?   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The Vredefort Ring structure in South Africa is believed to be a meteorite impact structure due to various geological features that cannot be explained by tectonic or volcanic forces. The impact event is hypothesized to have produced a crater 40 km across and 16 km deep, accompanied by distinctive signs such as shatter cones and shock-induced metamorphism.  

# METEORITE CRATERS ANDASTROBLEMES   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- A survey identifies several potential new impact structures, including Circular Lake Rossignol in Nova Scotia and Ramgahr in India, based on satellite imagery and geological markers. The evidence suggests these features may correspond with previously noted impact phenomena but remain under further examination.  

# CRYPTOEXPLOSION STRUCTURES CAUSED FROM WITHOUT OR FROM WITHIN THEEARTH?   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The concept of crypto-explosion structures has been debated, as some may have been caused by meteorite impacts, while others may stem from terrestrial processes. The paper asserts that certain shatter cone formations and other indicators traditionally associated with meteor impacts may not solely evidence such events, highlighting the complexity of these structures.  

# CRYPTOEXPLOSION STRUCTURES: ADISCUSSION   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The discussion surrounding crypto-explosion structures emphasizes their complex origins and the uncertainty in conclusively linking them to meteorite impacts. Despite ongoing debates, the suggestion is made that shock indicators such as shatter cones may unambiguously indicate intense geological events, potentially of meteoritic origin.  

# BIZARRE HYPOTHESIS   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The "bizarre hypothesis" presented by Richard Feldman postulates a correlation between the meteor responsible for the Meteor Crater and the orientation of petrified tree trunks in northeastern Arizona. While geologists view this idea as far-fetched, it raises intriguing considerations about the historical impacts on Earth.  

# ASTRONS-THE EARTH'S OLDEST SCARS?   [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The research indicates that immense, ancient structures resembling those found on the moon might exist on Earth, attributed to significant meteorite impacts throughout history. It suggests that the Earth's crust has endured many catastrophic events, potentially leading to structures with diameters approaching 3000 km due to their explosive energy release.
# Locations of Possible Astrons Inferred from Topographic Maps [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Discovery of Large Ancient Impact Crater**  
Soviet scientists have discovered a large and ancient impact crater, estimated to be 6 miles deep and 400 miles wide, in northern Kazakhstan. This finding supports the notion that large meteors continued to bombard Earth long after its early formation.

- **Geological Implications**  
The impact likely caused significant geological changes, including volcanic activity and the generation of ore deposits similar to those found in Ontario’s Sudbury Basin. It suggests that such impacts can deeply rupture the Earth’s crust.

# Circular Structures of Large Scale and Great Age on the Earth's Surface [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Characterization of Circular Patterns**  
The Earth's surface shows faint circular patterns defined by their near-perfect outlines and the presence of topographic highs along their rims. Observed in numerous regions, these circles vary widely in size, with diameters ranging from under 7 km to approximately 700 km.

- **Possible Origins of Circular Structures**  
These circular formations may have been formed by meteorite impacts during a significant bombardment of Earth around 4 billion years ago. The study of these circles could provide insight into mineralization processes and the geological history of impacted areas.

# Possible Meteoric Origin of the Ocean Basins [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Undersea Crater Off the Carolina Coast**  
An extensive undersea crater off the Carolina coast exhibits a large rim beginning near Puerto Rico and extending past the Bahamas and along the Atlantic Coast. This crater's floor slopes toward the rim, resembling the structure of lunar craters.

- **Geological Evidence Supporting Collision Theory**  
The National Geographic Society expedition found minimal sediment on the ocean floor, indicating that past oceanic floods removed deposits rather than sediment accumulation over time. Geological features, such as the curvature of the Appalachian mountains, suggest ongoing adjustments from the same impact that formed the crater.

# Origin of the Pacific Basin: A Meteorite Impact Hypothesis [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Evidence of Pacific Basin Formation**  
The Pacific Basin is theorized to have formed from an immense explosion during Earth's early history, possibly as a result of a collision with a sizable celestial body. This event is thought to have excavated a large crater, which explains the current geological characteristics surrounding the basin.

- **Impact of Explosions on Oceanic Crust**  
The resultant crater depression from this explosion lacks the lighter crustal layers, creating the current depth and structure of the Pacific Ocean. This hypothesis helps explain the geological anomalies and density variations observed in the Pacific compared to surrounding regions.

# The Origin of the Earth's Ocean Basins [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Formation of Mare-Type Basins**  
The Earth's original ocean basins are believed to have formed similarly to lunar mare basins due to asteroid-sized impacts around 4 billion years ago. These early events likely reshaped a significant portion of the Earth’s crust into the ocean basin topography we observe today.

- **Implications for Plate Tectonic Processes**  
The early establishment of oceanic and continental crust portions set the stage for later plate tectonic movements, subsequently transforming continents over geological time. This hypothesis suggests that ocean basins, like oceans, might be rare occurrences in the wider context of other planetary systems.

# The Origin of Continents [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Challenges in Understanding Continental Growth**  
The origin of continental nuclei remains a significant geological challenge, with past theories failing to account for early continental growth or facing serious objections. This study posits the impact of large meteorites may have played a crucial role in the formation and development of continental landmasses.

- **Evidence from Lunar and Planetary Research**  
Studying the Moon and Mars may provide critical clues regarding Earth’s continental origins due to their less dynamically altered surfaces. The research indicates that Earth experienced significant meteoroid bombardment early in its geological history, which likely contributed to forming its continents.
# TOPOGRAPHICAL ANOMALIES [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The major difficulties with the meteoroid impact model for the production of ocean basins include inconsistent morphology of ocean basins with impact and inadequacies in explaining the origin and growth of continents. This suggests that there are fundamental questions remaining about the geological processes involved in the development of the Earth’s surface.

- The effects of fracturing down to a depth of more than 50 km would significantly decrease the pressure locally at greater depths. This pressure drop, combined with volcanic activity following an impact, could generate considerable geological changes, potentially leading to the formation of continental nuclei.

# THE ORIGIN OF DIAMONDS IN THE DRIFT [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Diamonds found in the glacial drift of Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan may have originated from an ancient meteorite crater located near the Nastapoka island arc. Following a meteorite impact, brecciation extended approximately 150 km deep, bringing fragments of mantle-rock breccia containing diamonds to the surface.

- The deposits of sediment following the crater's formation lithified but were later displaced due to isostatic rise, exposing diamond-bearing rocks again. The occurrence of diamonds in glacial drift suggests these materials have been transported from their original location by glacial movements.

# LARGE-SCALE EMERGENCE AND SUBMERGENCE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Historical records indicate minor changes in sea level; for example, some Roman structures are now submerged while ancient Greek harbors are dry. However, the section notes extreme changes in sea level, including shifts of hundreds to potentially thousands of feet, evidenced by geographic features like wave-cut benches.

- The presence of whale bones far from oceans and old seawater in freshwater lakes supports hypotheses of substantial flooding in the past. The flat-topped seamounts known as guyots provide evidence that significant geological processes must have occurred to lead to their current underwater positions. 

# THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLENROY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The parallel roads in the Glen Roy region of Scotland are about 1,150, 1,070, and 860 feet above sea level, forming horizontal terraces in yielding drift. Their formation was initially attributed to various theories including aqueducts for irrigation and modifications by lake margins but is now better understood to be influenced by glacial activity.

- Discrepancies in elevations and the lack of sediment barriers necessary for their formation lead to the conclusion that glacial glaciers likely blocked and shaped the valleys, creating these terraces. As glaciers retreated, the associated lakes would have contributed to the features we observe today, reinforcing the impact of glacial dynamics on the landscape.

# RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Actual levelings in Ontario and Quebec reveal that old shorelines slope upward to the northeast, suggesting significant geological changes over vast distances. This phenomenon may result in a differential elevation that could seemingly rise as one approaches the northeastern tip of Labrador, indicating a historical rise of the land around Hudson Bay.

- The eastern and western shores of Hudson Bay present contrasting geological features, with the eastern composed mainly of crystalline rocks and the western consisting of lower, more horizontal strata. Evidence shows that there has been a comparatively rapid rise in land elevation, marking a dynamic geological process still ongoing today.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Rising Land**  
  On the eastern side of the bay, numerous well-preserved terraces in the till and other deposits provide striking evidence of the rising land. These terraces are found at heights up to about 300 feet, with fewer soft materials for evidence at higher elevations.

- **Driftwood Lines**  
  Long lines of driftwood observed at various locations are indicative that the elevation of the land is still occurring. This wood is found up to about 30 feet above high tide, with some remnants detected nearly 50 feet high, suggesting gradual stranding as the land rises.

- **Unexpected Tide Theory**  
  The theory suggesting that extraordinarily high tides may have deposited driftwood at various levels is deemed unlikely due to practical obstacles. It is asserted that such a tide would be brief and chaotic, leading to spontaneous accumulation rather than the orderly lines observed.

- **Postglacial Marine Transgression**  
  In the Canadian Northwest Territories, the postglacial marine transgression reached depths of 360-400 feet on the mainland and 550-650 feet on northern islands. The discovery of raised marine features, without systematic study, highlights the need for further investigation on land emergence.

- **Holocene Beach Lines**  
  A sequence of 185 raised beach lines observed at Hudson Bay correlates with a 45-year solar cycle, reflecting regular meteorological events. The uniformity of these terraces is notable and suggests a relationship with planetary configurations, a concept still debated in scientific circles.

- **High-Level Terraces in Ohio**  
  High-level terraces composed of rock benches and little transported material vary in height from 1100 to 2580 feet above sea level. Their origin is attributed to wave action during periods of submergence after glacial retreat, making them a testament to geological history. 

- **Raised Shorelines of Cape Maysi**  
  The raised shorelines at Cape Maysi, Cuba, showcase a recent geological uplift, characterized by remarkably preserved wave-cut benches. Their extent and condition, contrasting with nearby islands, suggest a unique and recent uplift event in the region's geological history.

- **Marine Evidence in Hawaii**  
  The island of Lanai displays some of the highest fossiliferous marine limestone found in Hawaii at an altitude of 1,069 feet. This and the presence of shorelines indicate significant geological emergence of the island, with similar evidence expected throughout Hawaii.

- **Tertiary and Quaternary Marine Terraces**  
  New Zealand's coastal terraces, ranging from 40-1200 feet, present a complex interplay of geological movement and sea-level changes. Their correlation with marine features in the Mediterranean emphasizes the importance of regional geological studies.

- **South African Shoreline Regulations**  
  Extensive terraces in South Africa at various altitudes indicate a series of geological events driven by both uplift and changes in sea level. The interplay between local geological evolution and global relationships complicates the understanding of these phenomena.

- **Lake Titicaca and Andean Lakes**  
  The highest lacustrine basin at the heart of the Andes, particularly Lake Titicaca, highlights significant geological history tied to the region's elevation. The lake's features and dimensions bring forward intriguing questions regarding the geological evolution of the Andes.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly of Lake Titicaca Fauna**: Lake Titicaca hosts species like seahorses that are typically marine, suggesting a historical connection between the lake and the ocean. This implies that the current fauna may have survived from a time when this body of water communicated directly with the sea.

- **Anomaly of Lake Poopo Salinity**: Lake Poopo, although sizable, has a mere depth of 9 feet and excessively salty water which inhibits fish from Lake Titicaca from propagating. This peculiar salinity in an endorheic system raises questions about the water's sources and its historical connections to other bodies of water.

- **Anomaly of Lacahahuira River and Lake Coipasa**: The Lacahahuira River seasonally drains into the briny Lake Coipasa, which lacks an outlet and contributes to the region's unique salinity profile. The uncertain extent of this lake and its transformation into a vast salt desert suggests significant geological changes over time.

- **Saltflat Extent in Uyuni**: The Uyuni salt flats, at an altitude slightly over 12,000 feet, are notable for their extensive area and significant saline presence. This large salt plain, along with its neighboring lakes, supports theories of a past oceanic connection for the entire Bolivian region.

- **Presence of Salt in the Bolivian Tableland**: The high concentration of salt in the Bolivian Tableland is attributed to the area's geological history rather than local formations of salt-producing rocks. This presence indicates a formerly larger body of water that eventually evaporated as connections to the ocean were severed.

- **Inter-Andean Sea Evidence**: The ancient sea, referred to as the Inter-Andean Sea, is supported by strand-lines and fossil records that indicate a prehistoric marine environment. The height variations of these strand-lines relative to present geological features provide evidence of significant uplift and geological activity over time.

- **Dimension Changes in Tiahuanaco**: The ruins of Tiahuanaco are over thirteen miles from Lake Titicaca, suggesting the lake has receded due to geological processes. Archaeological remains found near these ruins point towards Tiahuanaco once being a bustling harbor-town, now left dry.

- **Incrustations as Proof of Watery Past**: Traces of alkaline incrustations on the stone remnants at Tiahuanaco ties the site to historical waterfront locations. These features correlate with ancient strand-lines, reinforcing the idea of significant geological shifts that affected surrounding landscapes.

- **Strand-Line Slant**: The strand-lines revealed by surveys suggest that the former Inter-Andean Sea once had varying levels across its expanse, indicating a unique geological structure. The observed decrease in elevation towards the south further supports theories of a dynamic landscape shaped by ancient sea levels.

- **Ancient Agricultural Terraces**: The discovery of agricultural stone terraces at elevations that far exceed modern agricultural practices indicates a prior state of the region conducive to farming. This evidence suggests a significant uplift in the landscape following ancient occupation by agricultural civilizations.
# To the New England Seamounts [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Geologic Ages of Seamounts**: The geologic ages of the seamounts are not known with any degree of certainty. Ziegler tentatively dated shallow-water limestones from Bear and Mytilus seamounts as Eocene (45 million years ago), suggesting the peaks may be much older than the limestone.

- **Dives with Alvin Submersible**: During the first dive on Corner Rise at a depth of 2,035 m, native rocks encrusted with manganese were observed. The bottom was mostly sediment covered, containing recent Pleistocene mollusk shells.

- **Cliff Encountered**: At a depth of 1,800 m, a 200-m high cliff was encountered. Alvin quickly passed over a series of striking topographic features that resembled eroded basaltic structures.

- **Observations at Rehoboth Seamount**: At Rehoboth Seamount, many sponges, sea urchins, and fish were observed, but no live corals were found. Manganese covered dead coral in some areas, suggesting potential changes in environmental conditions.

- **Sampling on Mytilus Seamount**: At a second sampling station on Mytilus Seamount, rocks contained prominent algae strands in a calcite matrix. The presence of algae identified as Melobesia at greater depths indicates that this seamount has subsided by 3,000 m.

# Submarine Geology of the Gulf of Alaska [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Major Submarine Mountains**: The Gulf of Alaska contains thirty-five major submarine mountains with heights varying from 3,500 to 12,400 feet. These seamounts are categorized into two types based on their topographic features.

- **Topographic Provinces of Seamounts**: One province contains seamounts that are symmetrical and volcanic in origin, while the other comprises elongate and irregularly profiled seamounts. The slopes and alignment of the seamounts indicate their respective formations.

# Basaltic Cone Suggests Constructional Origin of Some Guyots [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Black Point Structure**: A flat-topped, conical accumulation of basaltic cinders and tuff-breccia at Black Point, near Mono Lake, serves as evidence of subaqueous eruptions. The clear, pale-brownish-green glass found here suggests a unique volcanic formation process.

- **Comparison with Guyots**: Traditionally, flat tops of guyots were attributed to erosional truncation by wave action. However, the findings at Black Point raise questions about this hypothesis, suggesting some guyots may be primary constructional features of submarine volcanism.

# Exposed Guyot from the Afar Rift, Ethiopia [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Submarine Volcanoes Found**: A series of originally submarine volcanoes in the Afar Depression have been identified, resembling oceanic guyots. The flattops of these structures suggest they could be constructional features rather than solely results of wave truncation.

# Sensational Change of Atlantic Bottom [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Reported Level Change**: A cable repair-ship reported a drastic change in the Atlantic Ocean's bottom level, discovering a depth of three-quarters of a mile where three miles had been charted in 1899. Such a substantial change in depth raises questions about its accuracy and scientific feasibility.

- **Possible Causes of Change**: The report sparked debates concerning whether volcanic activity could have caused the level rise. However, the improbability of such significant sediment accumulation or uplift in such a short time casts doubts on these claims.

# The Japanese Earthquake of September 1, 1923 [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Upheaval Observed Post-Earthquake**: Following the Japanese earthquake, notable upheaval occurred in a 2000 square mile area, with the greatest uplift recorded at Tomizaki, where land rose about 8 feet. This area later experienced significant subsidence within a month, causing further geological interest.

- **Conspicuous Depth Changes**: Hydrographic soundings indicated depth changes of 50 fathoms or more in Sagami Bay post-earthquake. Ongoing soundings aimed to ascertain further elevation changes across the affected region, highlighting the earthquake's impact.

# Mystery of the Submarine Valleys [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Origins of Submarine Valleys**: Submarine valleys up to 2,000 feet deep on the continental shelf raise questions about their origins, as they seem to imply recent significant land elevation. The hypothesis of atmospheric actions during land emergences is examined but deemed insufficient to explain observed depths.

- **Comparison with Terrestrial Valleys**: The resemblance between submarine valleys and land features suggests they may have been sculpted during periods of land elevation. However, the complexity of explaining such significant geological changes continues to challenge researchers.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The error of soundings conducted by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey may be within 1 percent for depths of 10 to 200 fathoms and 3 percent for depths greater than 200 fathoms. Positioning errors range from 1:500 to 1:1000 near shore and 1:200 to 1:500 when utilizing radioacoustic ranging offshore.

- Successful dredging in the Atlantic coastal plain and California coast yielded rock fragments from canyon walls, with notables like coarse sandstone and greensand found from the Georges Bank canyons. Fragments of rock ranged from Upper Cretaceous to late Tertiary age, demonstrating the geological history retained within these submarine canyons.

- Dredging methods significantly improved by the adaptation of the refraction seismograph provided new insights into the nature of the crystalline basement beneath the Atlantic coastal plain, indicating it lies beneath 12,000 feet of less consolidated material. This work has suggested that submarine canyons are deeply incised in rocks of Mesozoic or Cenozoic age.

- Davis proposed that localized ocean currents might maintain submarine valleys, suggesting that increased density from turbid waters could facilitate their descent. Daly countered with a Pleistocene origin theory, which claims a significant drop in sea level coincided with the icecap formation, leading to erosion along the continental slope.

- The hypothesis from Hess and MacClintock posits that sudden changes in the Earth's rotation may have led to a rapid transformation of the hydrosphere, impacting sea levels globally. This theory faces skepticism due to the formidable objections surrounding the mechanics of such a rapid change in rotation.

- Shepard's proposition of a dome-shaped icecap in the Polar Regions suggests it would have lowered sea level significantly, facilitating the excavation of canyons as rivers flowed over the continental slope. This theory, however, grapples with difficulties arising from the lack of clear evidence linking submarine currents with canyon formation.

- The composite origin theory suggests submarine canyons resulted from a combination of subaerial excavation during elevated margins, delta formation, and later submergence with a maintenance role played by slides and turbidity currents. The new explanation refutes solely submarine erosion or large sea-level changes, indicating a more complex geological history of these formations.

- Recent research into the Great Bahama Canyon reveals it consists of major branches with significant height and length, marked by erosion and sedimentary features suggestive of underwater currents. Observations of rounded rock and boulders along canyon floors point to the likelihood of submarine erosion processes at work. 

- A general agreement holds that submarine canyon cutting occurred primarily during the Pleistocene, with evidence of glacial modifications resonating in the canyon structures observed at higher latitudes. The presence of terraces on the continental slopes evokes further discussion regarding erosional influences and geological activity shaping current undersea features.

- The subaerial erosion hypothesis asserts that submarine canyons resemble terrestrial canyons, with patterns and dimensions suggesting a similar origin despite the challenges posed by sea-level fluctuations. Discourse surrounding the significant changes necessary for canyon formation has prompted various proposals concerning Earth's tectonic and hydrological histories.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Unheard-of subsidences**  
  The text discusses extreme subsidence that is required to expose the canyon-cut continental slopes and notes that such subsidence would need to occur only once. Despite the skepticism surrounding significant sea-level changes, the author suggests that a reduction in sea level by 3,000 feet may suffice for the formation of various glacial epochs.

- **Sea-level lowering**  
  Each glacial epoch was characterized by a sea-level lowering that led to the erosion of valleys and canyons above water levels. Resubmergence halted canyon cutting, but by the end of the Wisconsin epoch, some canyons had eroded completely across the shelf, indicating substantial geological change.

- **Submerged canyon parallelism**  
  There is a notable exception to the complete parallelism between submerged canyons and those found on continents, particularly concerning their long profiles. Most mature land streams exhibit a concave profile, whereas the Monterey seavalley and other submarine canyons do not, calling into question the expected behaviors of canyon formation.

- **Cutting of canyons in enclosed seas**  
  The existence of canyons in partially enclosed seas, like the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan, suggests significant geological activity beneath water levels considerably lower than their current state. The author hypothesizes that graben faulting led to the subsidence of canyon areas to depths below their original levels.

- **Flat-topped seamounts**  
  The concept is proposed that flat-topped seamounts or guyots might be volcanic structures truncated by wave erosion, with sea level changes drastically affecting their shapes. The author offers two explanations for discordance in summit elevations, involving both historical volcanic activity and geological processes.

- **Turbidity current hypothesis**  
  Opposing the idea of subaerial erosion, the turbidity current hypothesis suggests that silty underflows create deep-sea channels. Despite the acknowledgment of turbidity currents in controlled environments, their absence in oceanic contexts raises questions about their role in canyon formation.

- **Misplaced faunas at depth**  
  The finding of shallow-water organisms in deep-sea environments is often attributed to turbidity currents or submarine landslides, yet this evidence fails to convincingly support such claims. The author argues that misplaced foraminifera at great depths are likely due to subsidence rather than transportation through deep-water processes.

- **Seismic anomalies in Libya**  
  Anomalies detected in seismograms in Libya indicate buried channels incised far below current sea levels, suggesting significant geological events in the region's past. Oil geologists concluded that the Mediterranean must have been substantially lower than its present level when these channels were formed, though this theory faced publication challenges.

- **Deep-sea channels**  
  The discovery of river-like channels on the deep seafloor challenges traditional understandings of sediment transportation in marine environments, suggesting they may form through low-density turbidity currents. These channels play a critical role in sediment movement and may connect to submarine canyons.

- **Mid-ocean canyons**  
  Unlike typical submarine canyons, mid-ocean canyons found in abyssal plains present their own unique geological features that indicate complex erosional processes. One such canyon discovered off Brazil runs parallel to both the continental margin and mid-oceanic ridge, suggesting tectonic influences on its formation.

- **Meander in valley crossing a deep-ocean fan**  
  The presence of a tight meander in a deep submarine fan-valley is unexpected as meanders are typically associated with river channels on land. This discovery highlights the complex sedimentary processes that may occur in deep-sea environments, suggesting that similar river behaviors can manifest under ocean conditions.

- **Meandering deep-sea channel**  
  A well-developed meandering channel observed on the Ganges cone includes sinusoidal patterns indicative of consistent current dynamics. The characteristics of this deep-sea channel challenge assumptions about sediment transport and the mechanics governing underwater current formations.

# Submarine Valleys in Lake Superior  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Lake Superior soundings**  
  Recent soundings in Lake Superior revealed surprising valleys and ridges not previously understood, suggesting a more complex underwater topography than thought. Some of these valleys exceed 700 feet below the heights of surrounding ridges, indicating significant geological processes at work.

- **Geological history of Lake Superior**  
  The geological history of Lake Superior includes extensive glacial activity that shaped the existing valleys. The distinct structure and depth of these valleys can be attributed to the movement and melting of glacial ice over thousands of years and subsequent sediment deposition.

# Mounds and Pimpled Plains [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Natural earthen mounds**  
  Mounds are found worldwide, with particular concentration in the United States, where their origins have sparked scientific debate. Various theories exist on how these mounds formed, from geological processes to animal activity, highlighting the mysteries surrounding these structures.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **The Mima Mounds**  
  The Mima Mounds are large earth mounds found on the prairies of western Washington, with their origin remaining unclear for over a century. These mounds vary in height and shape, displaying unique geological features that have led to numerous theories regarding their formation.

- **Surrounding Cobblestones**  
  The hollows between the Mima Mounds often contain cobblestones, which resemble footballs in size. This peculiar fill raises questions about the erosional processes and historical geological events in the area.

- **Cross Section Revealed by Roadway**  
  When a mound is cut open, its cross-section reveals a structure made of soft black prairie silt mixed with pebbles. This layering leads researchers to consider glacial activities and the interaction between sediment deposition and erosion.

- **Mound Roots**  
  Structures extending from the base of the mounds have been termed "mound roots," which some investigators believe could be remnants of past biological activity. These roots add complexity to the mounds' formation process, suggesting a dynamic interplay between living organisms and the geological processes at work.

- **Gibbs and Cooper's Investigations**  
  Naturalists Gibbs and Cooper proposed various origins for the mounds after examining them during the famous railroad survey. These theories included the idea of giant root formations and the impact of water movements when the prairie was submerged.

- **Opinions of Louis Agassiz**  
  The renowned scientist Louis Agassiz dismissed various theories about the mounds, suggesting they were the nests of a particular fish species. His conjectures were based on observations made without direct examination of the mounds themselves, reflecting the challenges in accurately assessing their origins.

- **Joseph LeConte's Geological History**  
  In 1871, Joseph LeConte suggested that the mounds were formed through surface erosion under unique conditions left by a retreating body of water. His ideas contributed to a greater understanding of the geological context of these formations.

- **Alfred R. Wallace's Description**  
  Geologist Alfred R. Wallace used a metaphor comparing the mound formations to eggs covered with sand, illustrating the intricate nature of the mounds' topology. His depiction highlights the mystery surrounding the mounds’ creation in the broader context of geology.

- **G.W. Barnes' Theory on San Diego Mounds**  
  G.W. Barnes observed small hillocks on old sea terraces and attributed their formation to wind and water erosion. His conclusion reveals how similar processes may yield different landforms across varied climatic regions.

- **J.C. Branner's Conclusions**  
  In 1905, researcher J.C. Branner suggested that the ant-hill theory seemed most plausible but ultimately concluded that none of the existing theories were wholly satisfactory. This acknowledgment of uncertainty reflects the ongoing debates about the origins of mound formations.

- **Various Hypotheses by Marius Campbell**  
  Marius Campbell cataloged numerous hypotheses regarding the origins of mounds stretching across the plains, pinning potential causes on human activity, burrowing mammals, and geological forces. His work emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach to understanding mound formation.

- **J.Harlan Bretz's Glaciation Insights**  
  Bretz's studies on the glaciation of the Puget Sound region linked the formation of the mounds to water and ice action, which resonated with his broader research on the area's geological history. His conclusions provided a potential explanation for how glacial phenomena might shape landforms.

- **Ellis and Lee's Wind Action Explanation**  
  In 1919, researchers Ellis and Lee attributed the origins of the San Diego mounds to wind action amid sparse vegetation. Their observations revealed a gap in the understanding of how environmental factors contribute to mound formation.

- **C.C. Nikiforoff's Soil Studies**  
  Soil scientist C.C. Nikiforoff's 1941 report compared mounds in California with those in Puget Sound and suggested groundwater pressure influenced the presence of mounds. His findings highlighted the diversity of factors involved in mound formation across different regions.

- **Walter W. Dalquest and Gopher Theory**  
  Walter W. Dalquest, through his field observations, hypothesized that pocket gophers may have played a critical role in the development of the Mima Mounds. His theory posited that gophers, over time, actively created these structures, although no direct evidence of their construction has been observed.

- **Characteristics of the Pocket Gopher**  
  The pocket gopher, known for its burrowing habits, was identified as a possible architect of the Mima Mounds. The unique behavior of gophers, including their ability to create extensive underground networks, could explain the genesis and unique geometry of these land formations.

- **Indirect Evidence Supporting Gopher Activity**  
  Although direct observation of gopher mound construction is lacking, a number of indirect evidences have emerged that favor the gopher activity theory. These include the arrangement and composition of the mounds that defy explanations rooted in natural geological processes.

- **Factors Opposing Non-living Force Theories**  
  The theories suggesting non-living forces as the primary origin of the mounds struggle to adequately explain their unique structures and arrangements. The complexity and specific features of the mounds strongly suggest the agency of biological processes, particularly the actions of burrowing animals like gophers.

- **Mound Distribution in Relation to Gopher Range**  
  The presence of Mima-type mounds appears to coincide with the distribution of pocket gophers, suggesting a strong correlation between the two. Notably, the boundary of both gopher habitation and mound presence is distinctly demarcated near Puget Sound.

- **Evaluation of Similar Burrowing Animals**  
  Other burrowing animals similar to the gopher have been noted in areas with mound formations; however, the absence of gophers points to them being less relevant to mound formation. This distinction strengthens the argument for the specific role of gophers in developing Mima-type mounds.

- **Importance of Soil Layering in Mound Formation**  
  The characteristics of the soil layer over dense substratum have been noted as a significant aspect of Mima-type mound formation. These specific geological conditions may be crucial in promoting the unique formation processes associated with gopher activity.

- **Mounds in Deep Soil Without Gopher Structures**  
  Areas with deep soil that do not feature the Mima-type mounds suggest an absence of gopher activity in those regions. This characteristic supports the correlation between gophers' behaviors and the resultant mound formations.

- **Dismissal of Erosion as a Primary Factor**  
  The idea that erosion could lead to the formation of Mima-type mounds is largely rejected due to the uniformity of mound shape and the protection they receive from vegetation. The presence of mossy turf indicates these structures are resistant to erosive forces.

- **Imagination in Geological Forces**  
  An overreliance on imagination to explain the elaborate structures of the mounds has been deemed unproductive. The distinct characteristics of the mounds suggest a biological rather than purely geological origin.

- **Absence of Gophers in Mima Prairie**  
  The current absence of gophers on Mima Prairie is acknowledged, yet this does not negate the likelihood of their historical presence. The evidence that some natural forces impacted the local ecology could explain their former habitation and subsequent disappearance.

- **Potential Research Avenues for Gopher Mound Dynamics**  
  Questions remain regarding the dynamics behind mound formation and whether current environmental conditions facilitate the growth of similar structures. Exploring these avenues could yield deeper insights into the interactions between organisms and their geological environments.

- **Widespread Nature of Gopher Mounds**  
  The distribution of gopher mounds across various regions of North America raises questions about similar formations encountered by different naturalists. This shared phenomenon points to a potentially common origin tied to specific ecological conditions.
# THE MYSTERY OF THE MIMA MOUNDS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomaly: Gopher mounds of the Mima type**  
  These mounds, theorized to be of a natural origin, may exist worldwide if the topography allows for their formation. Their widespread distribution suggests a possible geological feature rather than a localized event.

# GULF COAST MOUNDS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomaly: "Mud lumps" near New Orleans**  
  Initial examination revealed these mounds were different from typical Indian mounds and had no clear explanation for their formation. A significant observation was made regarding their composition, which included hard orange sand and abundant shells with no signs of artificial construction.

- **Anomaly: Salt mounds in Southwest Pass**  
  These "salt mounds," formed from subsurface salt wells, exhibit unique geological behavior including the appearance and disappearance of wells filled with saltwater. Observations indicated vibrations and movements of the land, further complicating the understanding of these formations.

# PECULIAR EARTH-HEAPS IN MISSOURI [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomaly: Series of mounds along water courses in Missouri**  
  These mounds are notable for their consistent occurrence near water sources and their distinct shapes, yet they lack any evidence of human construction. The local population has attributed these structures to various natural agents, including beavers and gophers, but their true origin remains unexplained.

# ON THE HUMAN ORIGIN OF THE SMALL MOUNDS OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND TEXAS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomaly: Small isolated mounds in Louisiana and Texas**  
  These mounds, numbering in the millions and lacking human construction evidence, are thought to have natural origins, possibly formed by environmental processes. Historical observations suggest a high density of these mounds, making their formation by human activity implausible.

# THE SAND MOUNDS OF LOUISIANA AND TEXAS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomaly: Coastal plains mounds of Louisiana and Texas**  
  These mounds, often called "the pimpled plains," show a unique composition that can be traced back to the underlying strata, suggesting a connection to geological processes rather than human activity. The study of their structure indicates that they may form due to the interplay of clay and sand in an environment marked by specific hydrological conditions.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly of Mound Distribution**  
  The mounds show no regularity of distribution and exhibit no trend. Their diameters range from 4 to about 30 feet, with a few being larger.

- **Rejection of Hypotheses**  
  Eight hypotheses were discussed, including various natural processes such as differential settling and gas blowouts. Mr. Koons ultimately rejected all of these as explanations for the origin of the mounds.

- **Pocket Gopher Hypothesis**  
  The mounds are proposed to be made by the pocket gopher, Geomys bursarins, to keep itself out of water. This is attributed to its behavior of not creating mounds where surface or underdrainage is present, as they are not needed.

- **Difference in Soil Types**  
  The pocket gopher is said to not build mounds in areas prone to flooding, which is common in regions with more clay-rich soil, resulting in differences in mound formation. The author notes that deep soils, such as Beaumont clay, do not support gopher activity due to the lack of food.

- **Cattle Disruption of Mounds**  
  Cattle disrupt the newly made mounds by pawing them down, which prevents gophers from using them as residences. This behavior leads to a constant cycle of rebuilding the mounds by the gophers as they are frequently demolished.

- **Construction Process of Mounds**  
  The pocket gopher piles up loose earth from its burrow to create the mounds, often using runway material excavated elsewhere. The construction results in a round mound with an oblong depression on one side due to the excavated material being carried from a distance.

- **Secondary Pits on Mounds**  
  The small pits often found near the center of the mounds are identified as secondary features, unrelated to the gopher's construction. These pits are created by other animals, such as skunks or minks, that may burrow into the gopher's tunnels.

- **Adaptation of Animal Behavior**  
  The text discusses the possibility of an animal, such as the pocket gopher, adapting its behavior significantly to meet environmental needs, similar to other species that exhibit drastic changes in behavior. This raises questions about how such changes might develop evolutionarily.

- **Presence of Mounds Across Regions**  
  While the pocket gopher is prevalent across the Great Plains, noteworthy mound-making behavior is observed uniquely on the pimpled plains. In well-drained areas, smaller earth heaps created by gophers do not form large mounds like those found in the pimpled plains.

- **Possible Biological Evidence**  
  Several examples, including the ground squirrel and the blue heron, demonstrate that animals can adapt their nesting habits based on environmental conditions, supporting the notion that gopher behavior might have evolved similarly. This evidence suggests that animal behavior can be significantly influenced by flooding and water availability.
# Mounds and Pimpled Plains [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Fishingsts Hypothesis**: The hypothesis attributing the origin of mounds to fishingsts may be applicable in areas like San Diego and Tacoma, where geological conditions have been submerged underwater. However, this theory cannot explain mounds found in other parts of the country.

- **Spring and Gas-Vent Hypothesis**: While the spring and gas-vent hypothesis seems to fit conditions in regions like Louisiana and Texas, mounds are still prevalent in areas where these geological processes are absent. Therefore, this hypothesis lacks broad applicability and can be discarded.

- **Uprooted Trees Hypothesis**: The idea that mounds result from uprooted trees fails to gain support from experts familiar with the well-developed mounds. It requires the unrealistic assumption about the existence of giant sequoias across arid regions of southern California and Arizona.

- **Glacial Action Hypothesis**: Although glacial action might explain mounds in Washington, it does not account for the numerous mounds located in southern California and the Mississippi Valley. Consequently, this hypothesis can be excluded.

- **Chemical Segregation Hypothesis**: Proposed by Branner, the chemical segregation theory lacks supporting evidence and is deemed vague. The absence of direct observations makes this hypothesis unreliable in understanding the mounds' origins.

- **Wind Action Hypothesis**: The role of wind action in mound formation cannot be easily dismissed, as some mounds likely originate from wind-blown materials. However, the symmetry of natural mounds suggests that they cannot solely be attributed to wind action under varying climatic conditions.

- **Erosion Hypothesis**: The argument that mounds are formed through erosion has been popular among writers but rests on the assumption of rare and unusual conditions. Usually, it is recognized that normal erosion cannot produce such forms without assuming abnormal circumstances.

- **Human Construction Hypothesis**: While human construction has been suggested as a cause for mounds, arguments against this perspective are strong enough to categorize them with other discarded hypotheses. Believing that the millions of existing mounds are purely a result of human activity is considered absurd.

- **Burrowing Animals Hypothesis**: The hypothesis attributing mound formation to the action of burrowing animals, like ants and small rodents, remains uncertain with little evidence to definitively identify the agent responsible. However, there is no indication of significant burrows or chambers within the mounds observed so far.

# The Parramore Island Mounds of Virginia [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Mounds Description**: Parramore Island features a series of mounds scattered throughout a relatively low offshore island characterized by sand dunes and wave-built features. These mounds predominantly concentrate in the central section of the island, showing a variety in size and structure.

- **Erosion Evidence**: Evidence of advanced wave and current erosion on the island suggests significant topographic changes over time, with a notable regression of the beachline indicated on various maps. This might be tied to storm-induced inundation, which has caused horizontal sand movement inland.

- **Mound Arrangement**: The mounds on Parramore Island display a circular shape and a concentric-circle arrangement, leading to the suspicion of a former beachline orientation now altered by natural processes. When observed closely, the mounds reveal tonal and textural differences, notably affected by water flow.

- **Mound Measurements**: Aerial photographs depict the mounds, some reaching around ten feet in height, while the largest single mounds could be up to five hundred feet in diameter. The interplay between their size and their arrangement hints at a complex system of mound development.

# The Hillocks or Mound-Formations of San Diego, California [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Formation Characteristics**: The mounds and hillocks observed in San Diego are described as rounded eminences rising minimally from the landscape, varying in size from ten to fifty feet in diameter. Most are circular and distinct, scattered across sloping lands, mesas, and lower levels.

- **Origin Explanation**: Efforts to explain the formation of these mounds suggest they are modern modifications of the earth's surface influenced by natural agencies. Bushes play a crucial role in fixing locations for mound growth and facilitating the accumulation of materials.

- **Shrubs and Wind Interaction**: The shrubs, particularly species like Rhus laurina and Simmondsia californica, contribute significantly to mound formation by stabilizing the soil and trapping wind-blown dust. Their dense growth patterns help in elevating the soil over time as dust and decomposed leaves gather around them.

- **Role of Gophers**: Gophers, by digging into the loose soil around these shrubs, may contribute to the formation of the mounds but are viewed as secondary agents compared to wind action. The interplay of biological and physical processes highlights the complexity behind mound development in this region.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Peculiar susceptibility of the soil to wash**  
  The soil in the area exhibits a unique quality that makes it highly susceptible to washing away. This phenomenon is observable even to a casual observer and contributes significantly to the formation of mounds in the landscape.

- **Presence of beds of roots within structures**  
  Many modern structures reveal well-preserved beds of roots, suggesting a historical relation between the roots and the current topography. In contrast, the oldest formations have lost all traces of the original root systems.

- **Effect of timber and shrubbery on water drainage**  
  Timber and shrubbery are known to impede the drainage of water, affecting how it travels across the landscape. Groups of these plants help diffuse currents, preventing the concentration of water into gulleys and aiding in the symmetry of mound formations.

- **Influence of wash on moderate slopes**  
  The action of wash is most pronounced on moderate slopes, yet it can also be observed on steep and level areas. In these areas, accumulated water from neighboring slopes often converges into a gully before flowing out to sea.

- **Power of wind as a geological agent**  
  The winds exert a powerful influence on the formation of larger geological features, including sand dunes along Scottish shores and American lakes. Sand storms can deposit inches of dust over a short period, indicating the speed of erosion and formation processes driven by wind.

- **Burrowing animals as an exceptional agency**  
  While burrowing animals do create large excavations that can accumulate debris, their contributions to mound formation are deemed minor and exceptional. Mounds created by such animals tend to crumble without protective vegetation, leaving flat areas instead of remnants.

- **Erosion and subsidence relationship**  
  The initial formation process sees deposits heaped up around plants, which later undergo erosion leading to subsidence at the base. As the protective plants die off, erosion reduces the summit and widens the base until the deposit becomes compact and possibly permanent, or disappears completely.

- **Mounds exclusively on the Pacific slope**  
  Various factors contribute to the distinctive presence of mounds on the Pacific slope and arid plains, such as dense shrubbery and low foliage. The combination of environmental conditions necessary for mound formation is rarely found elsewhere.

- **Hypothesis regarding wind influence and sandy soils**  
  It has been postulated that wind plays a significant role in excavating soil around shrubs, facilitating mound formation. However, this action is more apparent in loose or sandy soils than in the firm uplands where mounds are primarily located.

- **Role of pebbles and rocks as nuclei**  
  Some suggest that pebbles and rocks may serve as nuclei for soil accumulation around which mounds form. Despite this notion, the presence of stones in the vicinity seems to promote erosion rather than hinder it, contributing little to mound stability.

# SAN JOSEQUIN VALLEY HOGWALLOWS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Origin theories of hogwallows**  
  A member of the Citrus Experiment Station posited that the finest hogwallows in the state form through clumps of vegetation retaining wind-blown soil. Conversely, a plant pathologist proposed that these mounds arise from water plants catching sediment from hillside runoff.

- **Nature of hogwallow land**  
  Hog-wallow land is characterized by reddish soil that does not expand when wet or shrink when dry, maintaining its shape. Contrary to its appearance during dry seasons, this land is rich and fertile once leveled and irrigated.

- **Depressions formed in wet seasons**  
  Certain areas of hog-wallow land show depressions that become ponds during wet seasons, featuring adobe-type soil. This suggests that these mounds did not form on flat lake beds as their rolling nature implies a more dynamic geological process.

- **Characteristics of hog-wallow soil**  
  The composition of hog-wallow soil includes fine material intermingled with considerable sand, fine gravel, and pebbles. The differences in texture reflect a combination of erosion and deposition processes rather than wind action alone.

- **Mounds formed rapidly rather than by gradual sedimentation**  
  The landscape's uneven characteristics and the presence of large mounds indicate that the material did not settle gradually, but rather was laid down quickly. Rolling land further affirms the hypothesis that the formation process was influenced by rapid movement of water.

- **Potential origins of the mounds**  
  Despite multiple theories for the hog-wallow mounds' origins, evidence suggests they may arise from uneven settling of soft, unconsolidated materials. This does not clarify why the mounds take specific shapes or form in the first place.

- **Gopher involvement denied for hog-wallow mounds**  
  Unlike the Mima Mounds linked to gopher activity, hog-wallow mounds show no signs of having been constructed by these animals. The efficient burrowing by animals does not require them to create mounds in such land.

# NATURAL MOUNDS IN CAPE COLONY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Natural mounds in Cape Colony**  
  The natural mounds observed in Cape Colony have sparked interest and speculation regarding their origin, paralleling discussions in the United States. Various theories have emerged, with the ant-hill theory being the most grounded yet insufficient for satisfying all queries.

- **Characteristics of the mounds**  
  These mounds are visible in sandy areas near the coast, marked by patches of bare soil due to intense sun baking. In cultivated settings, these mounds yield greater productivity compared to the surrounding soil, suggesting they hold undiscovered fertility.

- **Distribution and composition of mounds**  
  The mounds exhibit variability in structure, typically appearing red on slopes and light yellow on flats, often with depressions at their centers. This variation indicates differing soil properties and hydrological influences across the region.

- **Observations of rolling land**  
  The prevalence of larger mounds on rolling land suggests a dynamic process of formation rather than simple accumulation of sediment. Such patterns demonstrate that conditions conducive to mound formation extend beyond simple soil types or flat terrains.

- **Relation to vegetation and toxicity**  
  The presence of small patches of poison veld among ordinary veld presents another peculiar phenomenon, where identical bush types show poisonous characteristics. This suggests a possible nutrient absorption dynamic that needs further investigation.

- **Honeycombed landscapes**  
  The opposite condition of the hillock veld is the Kommetje veld, characterized by shallow depressions. This indicates various geological processes at play in the landscape, conditioned by the hydrology and soil composition across different terrains.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Earth Mounds in Unglaciated Arctic Northwestern America**  
  Curious, isolated, conical mounds, known as pingos, are scattered across the coastal plain from Point Barrow to the Mackenzie River. These mounds are most numerous in the Mackenzie District, specifically on a low, undulating plain that has emerged from the sea.

- **Origin of the Palsa Mounds**  
  Palsa mounds, characterized by their peat with frozen cores, are studied extensively in high-latitude mires, particularly in Finland and the Soviet Union. Research has revealed two groups of palsas in Lapland, one forming around 5000 BC and the other around 3000 BC.

- **Submarine Pingos in the Beaufort Sea**  
  The Beaufort Sea reveals abrupt features on the ocean floor, first noticed by a Canadian icebreaker, which were later identified as underwater mounds similar to pingos. These mounds vary in size and pose a hazard to navigation in ice-infested waters, necessitating further exploration of the continental shelf.

- **Other Types of Mounds**  
  In the western prairies, till mounds resembling giant doughnuts are formed from debris-filled pits left by stagnant ice, with the central depression being lower than the outer rim. These mounds, averaging 300 feet in diameter and 15 feet in height, are significant geological features of the region.

- **Scabland Mounds of Eastern Washington**  
  Thousands of circular mounds composed of different materials than the underlying basalt are found in the channeled scablands of eastern Washington. These mounds, which differ significantly in composition from the basalt, were formed by sediment accumulation in depressions left after the Spokane flood.

- **Some Topographical Features Formed at the Time of Earthquakes**  
  The origin of certain low mounds in the Lower Mississippi and Gulf Plain has sparked discussion, with some theories proposing that they formed during earthquakes. Evidence such as "sand blows," which resulted from the New Madrid earthquake, suggests that such geological features may have seismic origins.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Seismic Phenomena**  
  The region in question is one of notable seismicity, and it points out that phenomena like sand and water fountains, as well as mud volcanoes, are almost universally produced in connection with great earthquakes. The local ejection of sand and water, as well as draining through vertical pipes, can lead to various ground disturbances including "sand blows" and "pitted cones."

- **Mud Volcanoes**  
  In Italy, gas and water yield mud volcanoes, which are more vigorous during seismic shocks. A series of such mud volcanoes runs across Sicily, indicating a potentially promising field for future studies in structural geology.

- **Material Composition of Mounds**  
  The mounds generally consist of sand mixed with small quantities of various other substances, which are often foreign to the surface layers of the soil. During major earthquakes, such materials can spread out from openings, blanketing large areas with quicksand.

- **Rain in Earthquake Areas**  
  The geographical distribution of springs in the "sunk country" of the Lower Mississippi shows that large volumes of water are constantly surfacing along lines of fissures, leading to the belief that these springs are often accompanied by better quality water. This unique relationship supports observations about the geological conditions post-earthquake events.

- **Sulphur Emissions**  
  Following the New Madrid earthquake, there might have been unique emissions of sulphurous vapors that caused river water to be unfit for drinking purposes. The association of sulphur with the Gulf Plain mounds adds to the interest and complexity of the geological findings in that region.

- **Sand Blows and Vertical Movements**  
  Sand blows, mud volcanoes, and craterlets are closely related phenomena attributed to the vertical movement of water, gas, and sand along widened portions of earth fissures. Their connection with larger tectonic movements suggests that understanding these features is critical to appreciating the derangement of the ground water system caused by earthquakes.

- **Pitted Mounds**  
  Mounds in the Gulf Plain often exhibit a composition that differs from that of the surrounding plain, with some appearing pitted at their summits. This raises questions about the underlying structure and composition of these mounds in relation to their geological context.

- **Mud Lumps Formation**  
  Mud lumps forming in the Mississippi delta arise as small isolated cones of mud with craters at their summits, often releasing springs of dirty water. These lumps are associated with a higher water table and unique geological processes that indicate the area has been disturbed by subsurface activities.

- **Mud Volcanoes Influenced by Petroleum**  
  The Minbu mud volcanoes of India indicate that petroleum beneath them may play a role in their formation, showcasing how subsurface conditions affect surface geology. Similar mud cones found in various regions further highlight the interconnectedness of these geological phenomena.

- **Alignment of Fissure Springs**  
  The alignment of mud lumps or fissure springs along river mouths suggests a pattern in which new formations develop in response to subsurface geological conditions. Such insights might deepen our understanding of the evolutionary processes affecting the Gulf Plain over time.

# Unusual Erosion Surfaces [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Channeled Scablands**  
  The channeled scablands of Eastern Washington depict an anomalous geological process involving a catastrophic flood that dramatically reshaped the landscape. The debate surrounding their origin has evolved, affirming that they resulted from glacial waters that remade preglacial valleys into a network of river channels.

- **Recent Geology Insights**  
  New evidence has emerged illustrating five key points about the channeled scablands, including the existence of structural basins without exterior drainage prior to glacial flooding. This reinforces the understanding that the area's topography was significantly influenced by catastrophic hydrological events.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomalous Erosional Topography in Victoria Land, Antarctica**  
  An area of approximately 18 square kilometers at the head of Wright Dry Valley displays an erosional terrain characterized by a labyrinthine complex of erratic, interconnecting channels that cut to depths exceeding 100 meters in bedrock. This topography is interpreted as a result of catastrophic fluvial erosion, resembling that which produced the Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington, albeit on a much smaller scale.

- **Erosion Surfaces in the Caribbean and Their Significance**  
  Altimetric analysis of topographic maps in Puerto Rico indicates the presence of erosion surfaces at various average elevations, with the highest being 760 meters above present sea level. The distribution of these surfaces is thought to be related to changing sea levels, suggesting they originated as marine cut surfaces modified by sub-aerial processes over time.

- **Cloud-Burst Tracks and Water Gaps in Alabama**  
  A report describes great scars on Coosa Mountain caused by cloud-bursts during tornadoes in July 1872. The northwest side features a significant washout, while the southeast side has even larger scars, where immense boulders were transported down the slope, raising questions about their geological origins.

- **Features of the Central Arabian Desert**  
  Observations from a journey through the Central Arabian desert revealed peculiar horseshoe hollows (full) in the plain, resembling giant hoof prints. These hollows, which are permanent in size and shape, vary significantly in depth and width, indicating a unique erosional process affecting the desert landscape.

- **The Sahara Desert Icecap**  
  The sandstones above glacial moraines in the Sahara exhibit giant ripples formed by powerful currents, suggesting a significant geological event during the melt period of the Ordovician glaciated region. Additionally, traces of subglacial volcanoes found in the area challenge conventional notions, highlighting a connection between volcanic activity and glacial eras.

- **UFOs Ahoy!**  
  Underwater explorer Commander Jacques-Yves Cousteau reported discovering mysterious blue holes in the Caribbean Sea, resembling giant tiddleywink counters. These nearly perfect circular cavities, only a few feet deep, prompted speculation about their prehistoric formation from severe weather events.

# Plans of the Earth [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Geological Evidence for an Expanding Earth**  
  The idea proposed by Dirac that the gravitational constant may have decreased over time suggests that the Earth's volume is expanding. This expansion is associated with ocean regression and crustal fracturing, yet it also raises questions regarding the geological features observed in Earth's history.

- **An Expanding Earth?**  
  The theory of an expanding earth has gained attention as geophysicists face challenges accounting for continental drift and oceanic spreading. Recent advances in understanding ocean spreading suggest a modest expansion of the Earth over the past 200 million years, in some cases providing a more viable explanation for geological phenomena than was previously accepted.
# TOPOLOGICAL INCONSISTENCY OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT ON THE PRESENT-SIZED EARTH [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Certain continents have moved with respect to each other in a manner implied by sea-floor spreading and other data. However, the resulting collective motion of all the continents was apparently not topologically possible on the present-sized Earth.

# LIMITS TO THE EXPANSION OF EARTH, MOON, MARS, AND MERCURY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- New estimates of the palaeoradius of the Earth for the past 400 Myr from palaeomagnetic data limit possible expansion to less than 0.8%. This is sufficient to exclude any current theory of Earth expansion.

# EVIDENCE FOR EARTH-MOON FISSION [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The distribution of land and water upon the surface of the globe may be explained by the idea that the ancient tides produced the planes of marine denudation. The cooled crust beneath the continents is believed to be intrinsically less dense than that beneath the oceans.

# CONTINENTAL DRIFT CONTRADICTED [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The notion of random drift of continents over the surface of the Earth would require a far stronger set of convincing geological and geophysical facts than are known to date. There is an indication that the Earth's crust is not unchanged and demands explanations beyond simple horizontal displacement.
# Geological Considerations [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Paleomagnetic recordings in pre-Cenozoic rocks do not necessarily relate to the polar axis. This indicates that further research is needed before accepting paleomagnetic interpretations as valid criteria for continental drift.

- Numerous structural features of South America, North America, the Arctic basin, and Antarctica contradict the continental drift hypothesis. The interpretations based on factual geological data challenge the theory proposed by Wegener and require rigorous analysis.

# South America [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The alleged similarity of the Atlantic coast outlines of South America and Africa fails to account for the effects of marine erosion since the Early Cretaceous. Studies indicate that this "fit" is not evidence of continental drift and more geological details are required for validation.

- The structure of the Atlantic coast of South America shows normal block faulting rather than evidence of continental drift. Geological surveys reveal that the vast Parana basin is characterized by block faulting, further negating the arguments for continental drift.

# Antarctica [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Geological studies suggest that eastern Antarctica forms a significant shield area consisting mainly of ancient granite and metamorphic rocks. The structural features of Antarctica support the notion of accretion rather than continental drift, indicating a stable geological history.

- The Transantarctic Mountains separate eastern Antarctica from a younger and tectonically mobile western region. This implies that the structural development within Antarctica aligns with tectonic stability rather than the expected effects of hypothetical continental drift.

# North America [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The geological history of North America shows evidence of evolution through in-situmagmatic differentiation rather than continental drift. Notably, assessments of the San Andreas fault indicate localized movements rather than evidence of widespread drift.

- Significant variations in the ages of orogenic belts between North America and Europe contradict the drift hypothesis. The geological record suggests that the structural evolution was not caused by a drifting mechanism but rather by localized geological forces.

# Arctic Basin [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Studies in the Arctic basin reveal a consistent pattern of vertical block faulting, which contradicts the concept of northwestward drift of the North American continent. The tectonic stresses observed in this region indicate vertical, rather than horizontal, displacement.

- The presence of magnetic anomalies in the Arctic basin supports a block-faulted structural pattern, which does not align with the hypothetical drift of North America. The absence of evidence for large-scale horizontal displacement indicates that the continent has remained relatively stable.
# "THE NEW GLOBAL TECTONICS": MAJOR INCONSISTENCIES [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Several sets of paleoclimatic data suggest that the current positions of the rotational axis, continents, and ocean basins have remained constant for at least 1,600 million years. Fossil invertebrate and tetrapod faunas further indicate the constancy of these positions for a minimum of 570 million years.

- The topological requirements for moving the Americas away from Eurafrica imply that such movement would only be possible if the Earth had considerably expanded in the last 150-200 million years. Additionally, north-south movements of individual continents are limited to a few hundred kilometers based on paleoclimatic and paleontologic data.

- Ocean basin studies reveal the undeformed nature of island-arc trench fills, challenging the validity of "subduction" theories as traditionally proposed. Detailed studies at the Lesser Antilles and Tonga-New Zealand arcs show that seaward seismic island chains have maintained their relative positions since the mid-Mesozoic and late Paleozoic times.

- The examination of sediment fills in fracture zones across mid-ocean ridges also indicates an absence of deformation, which contradicts expectations of sea-floor spreading. JOIDES drilling results have revealed that the "basement" beneath Mesozoic rocks is actually late Tertiary or younger, further undermining support for "new global tectonics."

# OBJECTIONS TO CONTINENTAL DRIFT AND PLATE TECTONICS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The paper identifies longstanding problems with the continental drift hypothesis, asserting that the continents likely have not moved with respect to each other. It also argues that convection may not be active throughout the entire mantle, and even if it were, it cannot sufficiently explain the drift.

- Positions derived from paleomagnetism suffer from unknown sources of error, making them too imprecise for reliable drift reconstructions. This paper emphasizes the importance of addressing objections to the drift hypothesis while considering contradictory evidence.

# GEOPHYSICAL ILLUSIONS OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The proposed geometric models for mobile plates, moving continents, and associated processes are inherently mutually exclusive. The areas expected to showcase plate tectonics, such as Iceland and India, have instead demonstrated clearly the absence of such tectonic activity.

- The premises of continental drift, along with interpretations of geological phenomena such as sea-floor spreading, are deemed flawed and ultimately fruitless. The paper critiques the absence of a coherent mechanism to support these theories, illustrating numerous contradictions.

# VOLCANO SPACING IN EAST AFRICA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The near-rectilinear pattern of volcanoes in the Galapagos Islands and the regular spacing of Hawaiian volcanoes suggests a universal spatial relation, but attempts to relate these spacings to crustal thickness have been unsuccessful. Modern studies revealed that the distance between oceanic volcanoes is closely linked to the thickness of the lithosphere rather than the crust itself.

- Research on the northern section of the East African rift shows that the relationship between volcano spacing and lithosphere thickness is consistent across different types of volcanic rock. The reasoning behind this regularity remains unclear, prompting further inquiry.
# Topographical Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Large land excess in the northern hemisphere**: The disparity between the land distribution results in a significant land mass in the northern hemisphere and a corresponding deficiency in the southern hemisphere. This anomaly has implications for climatic and ecological conditions across both hemispheres.

- **Broadening of continental areas toward the equator**: Continental areas widen toward the equator from their pointed southern extremities, forming a near-continuous ring around the polar ocean. This geometric arrangement influences global weather patterns and ocean currents significantly.

- **Open polar ocean and surrounding landmass**: The existence of an open polar ocean in the north and a continental mass surrounded by water at the south pole denotes a considerable geophysical anomaly. This situation affects marine navigation and biodiversity in these regions.

- **Elevated land near southern extremities**: Generally, the land at the southern tips of continents is at a higher elevation compared to the northern regions. This elevation is particularly notable in continents like South America, Africa, and Asia.

- **Extensive low-lying and marshy areas**: The northern portions of continental masses are characterized by large, low-lying marshy or desert areas. Such regions can significantly impact local ecosystems and human settlements.

- **Carboniferous deposits in northern basins**: The presence of extensive carboniferous deposits, including forests, in northern basins points to a differentiated geological history. This suggests that the climatic and environmental conditions of the past have shaped the current landscape.

- **Inverse distance correlation of southern landmasses**: The distances of South America, Africa, India, and Greenland from the South Pole are inversely related to their sizes. This peculiar correlation may provide insights into the geological and climatic history of these continents.

- **Contrasting flora during the Gondwana period**: Flora in India during the Gondwana period exhibited stark differences from that in Europe but shared similarities with contemporaneous flora in South America, South Africa, and Australia. This indicates historical biogeographical connections among these regions.

- **Temperate climate discrepancies**: The southern portions of South America and Africa tend to be less temperate compared to corresponding northern latitudes, affecting regional biodiversity and climate adaptation strategies. This variation raises questions about historical climatic conditions.

- **Lack of secular change in latitude**: No significant latitude change has been established for the continental areas in the northern hemisphere, suggesting stability in geological history. This stability is essential for understanding long-term continental movement.

- **Observed earthquake displacements**: Observations in California, the Philippines, and Japan indicate a relative southward movement of continental areas concerning the Pacific Basin. These patterns of displacement provide insight into tectonic activity and continental drift.

- **Greater specific gravity under ocean beds**: Direct evidence suggests that the Earth's crust beneath the ocean beds is of notably greater specific gravity than that of the continental regions. This discrepancy points to a complex geological structure beneath the oceans.

- **Variability in specific gravity of meteorites**: The specific gravity of meteorites varies considerably, indicating that they are composed of a range of materials from stone to iron. This variability influences the understanding of their impact and contributions to Earth's geology.

- **Need for explanation of specific gravity differences**: The substantial differences in specific gravity among planetary bodies, assumed originally to be homogeneous, require a thorough explanation. This raises questions about the processes during the formation of these celestial bodies.

No significant motion has been observed for these blocks in the last century, and their origins remain a mystery despite various theories.

- **Influence of Earthquakes on Rock Movement**: The movement of blocks within the stone-rivers has been theorized to occur due to the action of earthquakes which may dislodge them from their resting place. However, there are no concrete observations or evidence to quantify this movement.
# Unusual Rocks [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Movement of Soilcap Enclosing Stones**  
  This anomaly involves the soilcap that encloses stones being moved, with the soil itself being washed away by streamlets in valleys. This process highlights the way surface water can reshape the landscape by eroding soil away from beneath heavier stones.  

- **Former Movement of "Earth-Glaciers"**  
  Once active "earth-glaciers" moved due to climate changes, they eventually became desiccated. After this transformation, rain and streams washed away the earth, fundamentally altering the terrain.  

- **Action of Frost and Snow**  
  The alternate freezing and thawing of rain creates significant changes in the landscape due to the action of frost and snow. This cyclical process contributes to erosion and the movement of rocks and soil over time.  

- **Action of Glaciers**  
  Glaciers have a distinct movement that can be explained through glacial theory, suggesting they might produce ground moraines similar to features found in other regions, like Maine. This movement shapes the earth by compressing and relocating materials as glaciers advance and retreat.  

- **Expansion and Contraction of Rocks**  
  The phenomenon of blocks expanding and contracting under temperature changes occurs mainly down slopes, assisted by gravity. This slight movement, though often overlooked, plays a role in the gradual dislodging of rocks from more stable positions.  

- **Stone-Rivers**  
  The assumption that heavy quartzite blocks could be transported over considerable distances may not be necessary, as some blocks might still remain close to their original locations. This challenges traditional ideas about how streams interact with and move debris across landscapes.  

- **Blocky Structure on Mountain Summits**  
  The "blocky structure" seen on mountain summits arises from layers of hard and soft rock, where softer layers erode and harder bands break off, creating a tumultuous appearance. These blocks tend to remain in their fallen positions due to insufficient forces acting on them, suggesting a slower rate of change in these environments.  

# Rock Streams in the Sierra Nevada, California [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Surface Characteristics of Rock Streams**  
  The surface of rock streams features numerous bulges and ridges, especially evident towards their lower parts, suggesting underlying formations influenced by past glacial activity. These ridges may correspond with nivalation features that ran parallel to the cliffs, indicating movement and deposition patterns.  

- **Distribution of Rock Streams**  
  Rock streams show significant variation in size, thickness, and distribution, often increasing in thickness towards their lower ends. This variation reflects the geological conditions and materials present, specifically how jointing affects the disintegration process that creates these features.  

- **Behavior of Rock Streams**  
  The surface of rock streams displays a typically concave shape rather than being convex, indicating a distinct accumulation and flow pattern influenced by the underlying geological structure. This observation suggests that the streams retain specific characteristics from their formation phase that can reveal insights into past glacial interactions.  

- **Rock Stream Composition**  
  Rock streams comprise materials of various sizes, from sand to large blocks, with the size distributions depending on the geological substrate they originate from. The texture and composition of these streams provide valuable information regarding the history of the upheaval and erosion in their respective regions.  

- **Lithological Influence on Rock Streams**  
  The composition of the rock from which streams are derived significantly affects their number and size. Granitic rocks tend to yield more substantial and larger rock streams, while metamorphic sediments lead to smaller and less numerous accumulations, highlighting the interplay between geology and geomorphology.  

- **Glacial Features of Rock Streams**  
  Ultimately, the evidence indicates that rock streams are glacial features formed under specific conditions suitable for ice accumulation and movement. Their characteristics, such as the positioning in valleys and interaction with other glacial deposits, reinforce this conclusion.

  The behavior of sturzstroms during their movement phases can be dramatized into distinct acts—fall, jump, and surge—which characterize their dynamics and effects, highlighting the complex interplay of gravitational and mechanical forces at work. The need for further understanding of these behaviors persists within geological studies.  

- **Modeling Sturzstrom Behavior**  
  Scale models of sturzstroms provide insights into their kinetic properties and practical applications, helping scientists analyze their movement under various conditions. By simulating these flows, researchers can extract data that aids in predicting the behavior of sturzstroms in real-world scenarios.
# Rockfall Dynamics [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The fallen block started to disintegrate, yet the broken parts moved in unison like a herd of galloping sheep. One-eighth of the fallen mass broke off from the main block and never made it to the bottom of the slope, remaining stuck near the breakaway scar.
  
- In the second stage at Elm, the fallen mass hit the flat floor of a slate quarry and became completely disintegrated. The debris shot horizontally forward, with a witness describing the rapid movement and chaotic scattering of materials.

- The implications of these findings urge further investigations into the types of rocks and their magnetic properties, as well as the potential effects of environmental factors like weather on magnetic readings.

# MAGNETIC RECORD OF LIGHTNING STRIKES IN SANDSTONE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Anomalous magnetization in sandstone linked to lightning strikes has been documented for the first time in a study of the Moenkopi Formation in Arizona. Two distinct regions of high remanent magnetization were discovered, suggestive of patterns similar to those produced by previous studies on volcanic rocks.

- The magnetic properties observed in the sandstone imply localized phenomena potentially caused by rapid discharge events, prompting further investigation into how natural events can create persistent magnetic anomalies in geological formations.
# PALEOMAGNETIC PROBLEMS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Self-reversal of rock magnetism**: A basic assumption in paleomagnetism has been that magnetic excursions occur simultaneously across the globe. This assumption may be flawed, as certain types of rock magnetism could lead to self-reversal, complicating global reconstructions based on paleomagnetic data.

- **Self-magnetism**: The phenomenon where rocks acquire magnetization due to their own magnetic properties poses a challenge to understanding their magnetization history. If rocks exhibit self-magnetism, it may produce misleading interpretations of Earth's magnetic field changes over time.

- **Distortion of magnetized sediments**: Deformation of sediments can easily affect magnetization readings, leading to inaccurate magnetic data. Careful consideration must be given to sedimentological contexts to avoid errors in paleomagnetic studies.

- **External physical and chemical processes**: Various environmental factors may alter the magnetic properties of rocks over time, which complicates the reliability of paleomagnetic data. Such modifications can mask original magnetic signals, leading to incorrect conclusions regarding past geomagnetic behavior.

# COULD PALAEOMAGNETISM BE WRONG? [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Question regarding the axial hypothesis**: Paleomagnetic data has been instrumental in supporting the ideas of continental drift and plate tectonics, predominantly using the assumption of an axially dipolar magnetic field. However, evidence suggests that for certain geological periods, such as the Permian, the axially dipolar hypothesis may not hold, leading to potential reevaluation of continental movement theories.

- **Conflicts with paleontological data**: Studies indicate inconsistencies between paleomagnetic data and biodiversity patterns in brachiopods, suggesting that the assumptions made regarding magnetic field behavior may need reassessment. This tension underscores the necessity to critically evaluate paleomagnetic data against other geological evidence.

# MAGNETOSTRATIGRAPHIC PITFALLS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Growing controversy over young excursions**: The existence and reliability of young geomagnetic excursions, such as the Gothenburg event, are under scrutiny. Issues arise surrounding whether these features are true records of magnetic anomalies or results of unnoticed natural and artificial deformations in strata.

- **Errors in magnetostratigraphic analysis**: Various factors can lead to inaccuracies in magnetostratigraphic interpretations, such as post-depositional overprints and deformation from sampling techniques. These complications may significantly undermine the reliability of conclusions drawn from magnetostratigraphic studies.

# DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETING MAGNETIC REVERSALS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Chemical and structural differences in lavas**: Investigations into lavas from places like the Isle of Mull reveal notable differences between normally and reversely magnetized samples, complicating theories of magnetic polarity reversals. The lack of corresponding differences in their magnetic properties raises questions about how to reconcile past field behavior with observed chemical variations.

- **Conflict between field reversal evidence and self-reversal mechanisms**: A clear relationship between oxidation states of basalts and magnetic polarity raises a dilemma: if field reversal is accepted, the chemical differences must be reinterpreted, possibly linking oxidation states to magnetic polarity in some unknown manner. The occurrence of both self-reversal and field reversal in the same sequences indicates a deeper complexity in understanding volcanic magnetization.
# SELF-REVERSING OCEANIC BASALTS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The existence of both normal and reversed NRM in even small portions of lava flows suggests a mystery regarding the Earth's magnetic field at that time. The concept of self-reversal may contribute to understanding this phenomenon alongside stable NRM, which serves as a reliable paleomagnetic indicator.

- Ozima and Ozima's study noted that three out of eight submarine basalts displayed self-reversal properties under specific conditions. These findings challenge the assumption that linear ocean anomalies primarily arise from repeated reversals of the Earth's magnetic field.

# PALEOMAGNETIC EXCURSIONS AS MAGNETOSTRATIGRAPHIC HORIZONS: A CAUTIONARY NOTE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Spatial and temporal inconsistencies in paleomagnetic excursions raise doubts about their reliability as chronological markers. Evidence for these excursions is not always consistent within sedimentary basins, suggesting a need for caution in their interpretation.

- The anomalies associated with paleomagnetic directions across various sedimentary cores highlight issues of inconsistency. For instance, in the Gulf of Mexico, only eight of fifteen cores showed evidence of a specific excursion, with significant variations in magnetic signatures observed between cores.

# REMANENT MAGNETIZATION OF THE UPPER-MIOCENE 'BLUE' SANDSTONES OF CALIFORNIA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The primary component of magnetization in Upper-Miocene sediments was found to develop post-depositionally, rather than through the initial alignment of magnetic grains. This finding indicates that known magnetization processes may not apply uniformly to all sediment types.

# MAGNETISM AND ARCHAEOLOGY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The absence of known reversely magnetized archaeological materials is disputed, particularly regarding the ancient vases from the eighth century BC. Observations on clay fired in kilns reveal evidence of magnetic field reversals during that time, suggesting a historical geographical variability in magnetic behavior.

- Mercanton’s studies of earlier artifacts indicate that the magnetic field direction during their formation differed from the present. This implies that reversals are not isolated events but may have significant implications for our understanding of historical geomagnetic activity.

# GEOMAGNETIC POLARITY CHANGE, VOLCANIC MAXIMA AND FAUNAL EXTINCTION IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The correlation between numerous geomagnetic field reversals and faunal extinctions suggests a potential link between climate changes and these magnetic events. The synchronous nature of microfaunal extinctions with polarity changes raises questions about the underlying mechanisms.

- The lack of methods to trace the timing of large earthquakes creates challenges in understanding the historical relationship between seismic activities and geomagnetic changes. Furthermore, examining volcanic activity during polarity transitions may provide insights into this complex relationship.

# EARTH'S MAGNETISM DOES CORRELATE WITH CLIMATE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- A study indicates a statistically significant correlation between geomagnetic field reversals and climatic changes over the past millions of years. Anomalies associated with microfaunal changes and oxygen isotope ratios strengthen this connection.

- Researchers speculate that climatic changes could influence geomagnetic field reversals, particularly through alterations in the Earth's rotation. This hypothesis suggests a reciprocal relationship where geological and atmospheric processes interplay in shaping Earth's magnetic behavior.
# PETRIFYING SPRINGS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The well-known petrifying stream at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, England, forms a cascade from the River Nidd that petrifies objects hung in its dripping waters. People send various items, from sponges to books and animals, to see them transformed through the petrifying process, which can take several months to years depending on the object.

- Many petrified objects displayed in the custodian's museum are enlarged and misshapen due to the effects of silicate deposition. A notable example includes a cat that appeared to have its legs joined and was completely turned to limestone, losing all organic structure.

# PETRIFACTIONS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- A report from the Marshall Statesman in 1851 describes the discovery of a completely petrified body of Mrs. Phelps after her exhumation, retaining features and proportions resembling stone. The body was found unresponsive to edge tools, indicating a hard, stone-like condition and produced a hollow sound when struck.

- Another account shared by Goodwin details a lady from Felicity who, after being buried in her orchard, was later found petrified with all features clearly visible, disproving contemporary theories about petrifaction. Her family remains to attest to the truth of this remarkable preservation.

# OBSERVATIONS OF A SO-CALLED PETRIFIED MAN [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- In August 1894, a so-called petrified human body of a Negro woman was discovered while workmen repaired a road in Alabama. Upon examination, it was found in a remarkably preserved state, appearing firm and hard to the touch, leading workers to believe it was petrified.

- The burial site was identified as a neglected family graveyard, and the soil was observed to be moist and sandy, which contributed to the preservation. Although the body demonstrated some decomposition, key features and hair remained well-preserved, prompting continued investigation into its remarkable condition.

# COMBUSTION METAMORPHISM [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- The eastern region of Wyoming is characterized by widespread redbeds and slag-like materials formed from the burning of lignite coal, giving the landscape distinctive appearances. The metamorphosed soils and sediments in this area have garnered attention from geologists for their unique physical properties and implications for the understanding of geological processes.

- Various formations include buff, brick-red, or indigo argillaceous materials that encompass fossils and show structural integrity. These materials have undergone oxidation and incipient fusion, significantly altering their coherence and forming structures resistant to erosion.
# COMBUSTION METAMORPHISM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Spontaneous subsurface combustion**
  - In Southern California, organic matter in bituminous sediments has undergone spontaneous combustion, reaching temperatures of up to 1600°C. This process affected extensive areas and led to the recrystallization and partial melting of rocks, forming pseudomagmas that intruded into country rocks.

- **Chemical compositions of melts**
  - The resulting melts from combustion metamorphism differ from typical igneous magmas, forming immiscible acid and intermediate siliceous melts as well as phosphatic melts. High-temperature minerals identified in the study include quartz, wollastonite, graphite, and cordierite, while lower-temperature minerals include pyrite and gypsum.

# FISSION TRACK AGE OF THE 'MOTTLED ZONE EVENT' IN ISRAEL [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Peculiar rock complex**
  - The Mottled Zone in Israel is characterized by irregular coloration, disappearance of bedding, and schist-like structures, representing a striking departure from the normal sedimentary sequence. This zone exhibits a unique mineral assemblage, including common calcite and spurrite, alongside rare minerals typically found in high-temperature environments.

- **Unexplained heating event**
  - Despite the presence of high-temperature minerals, there is no clear indication of the heat source that generated these conditions. Previous theories have sought explanations, such as subsurface oxidation, solar heating, or contemporaneous sediment deposition, but none have provided conclusive evidence.

# NATURALLY REDUCED IRON [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Presence of lignite and nodules**
  - Along the North Saskatchewan River, a significant lignite layer is observed beneath overlying dark gray clay-shale and soft argillaceous sandstone containing clay ironstone nodules. Although no local nodules were analyzed, similar nodules from Edmonton showed high metallic iron content.

- **Formation of metallic iron from lignite combustion**
  - The lignite seam has burned out over large areas, leaving behind a layer of debris rich in ashes and clinkers. This process has reduced nodules of ironstone to metallic iron, which can be found as rusted fragments in the burnt clay.

# HEATING OF LOCAL AREAS OF GROUND IN CULEBRA CUT, CANAL ZONE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Localized heating phenomenon**
  - In the Culebra Cut region, the marl shales show signs of localized heating which can sufficiently char wood without igniting it. This heating event can last from several days to weeks and is characterized by the oxidation of carbonaceous material leading to color changes in the shales.

- **Hypothesis of pyrite oxidation**
  - Initial hypotheses suggested that the observed heating could be connected to blasting, but these were dismissed based on evidence of localized heating, unrelated to the chemical composition of the beds. Instead, tests revealed the presence of sulfuric acid and gypsum, supporting the notion that pyrite oxidation could be the source of the heating phenomenon.
# ISOTOPIC ANOMALIES [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Anomaly of Isotope Abundances**
  The natural terrestrial abundances of isotopes can vary significantly from expected levels. These discrepancies can signal unusual historical conditions or indicate that rocks did not receive their fair share of isotopes when formed.

- **Helium Loss from Earth**
  Scientists studying the Earth's atmosphere have noted a significant loss of helium, leading to hypotheses about its rapid escape. One theory suggests that a catastrophic event may have caused this loss, rather than the continuous escape that was previously assumed.

- **Enrichment of Primordial He-3**
  Recent studies observed a large enrichment of He-3 in deep Pacific water compared to atmospheric ratios. This suggests that excess He-3 may be due to leakage into ocean water from a remnant of the Earth's primordial helium.

- **Carbon-14 Variations in Coral**
  An analysis of Bermuda brain coral spanning from 1770 to 1976 showed significant C-14 variations corresponding to nuclear bomb testing. The coral data reflects atmospheric changes influenced by both nuclear activities and fossil fuel burning.

- **Separation of Isotopes in Rocks**
  Research indicates varying carbon isotope ratios in natural methane, raising questions about their origins. The study suggests that either bacterial activity contributed to the differences, or that fractionation occurred during migration through rocks.

- **Isotopic Studies of Precambrian Rocks**
  The isotopic composition of reduced carbon in Precambrian cherts indicates a potential major biological evolution event. The variations highlight the differences between younger geological organic matter and carbon found in early rocks.

- **Ancient Earth Rock Layers**
  Geologists propose the existence of a thick, unaltered rock layer beneath the continents, challenging the notion of a homogeneous mantle. Evidence from neodymium isotopes suggests that this layer contains remnants of the Earth's primitive materials.

- **Atomic Weight of Lead from the Belgian Congo**
  Recent studies on lead samples from Central Africa may reveal insights into atomic weights derived from radioactive disintegration. The analyses found significant radioactivity in the lead, likely linked to uranium decay processes.
# ANOMALOUS LEADS FROM THE UPPER GREAT LAKES REGION OF CANADA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- The authors report the presence of lead with anomalous isotopic composition in the Sudbury mining area. They found several anomalous leads in the Upper Great Lakes region of Ontario, some showing greater anomalies than those discovered at Sudbury.

- Anomalous leads in the Thunder Bay region exhibit extreme variation in isotopic composition despite being geographically close. The isotopic composition also appears to correlate with distance from the Lake Superior shore, indicating a trend in radiogenic components.

# ABNORMAL NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Fossil bones excavated from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia were found to be highly radioactive, specifically those collected in the Nemegt Valley. Notably, Cretaceous specimens showed approximately seven times higher radioactivity than younger Palaeocene bones from the same area.

- The surrounding rock's radioactivity in the Nemegt Valley was similar to that of other localities, except for one sample that was notably radioactive. This suggests that uranium accumulated in the bones from percolating groundwater rather than from the surrounding rock.

# NATURAL FISSION REACTORS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- A natural nuclear reactor system was discovered in Gabon, which was functioning millions of years before the first man-made reactor. This phenomenon was confirmed through marked anomalies in the uranium-235 isotope abundance in the area's uranium samples.

- The age of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor is estimated at 1.8 billion years, and its findings may have implications for evolutionary processes on Earth. Various regions around the world may also have experienced nuclear reactions similar to those at Oklo, accelerating species evolution.

# SUPERHEAVY ELEMENTS IN NATURE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Evidence for superheavy elements has significant implications for outdated ideas regarding nuclear structure and dating methods. The presence of these elements could challenge established understandings of the age of monazite deposits found in rocks.

- Research indicates the possibility of superheavy elements with atomic numbers exceeding those previously known. Discoveries from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and associated institutions shed light on these heavy atoms' existence, leading to a reevaluation of theories concerning nuclear stability and synthesis.
# Nuclear Geology [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Finding superheavy elements in monazites**: The presence of superheavy elements in monazites raises questions regarding their stability and decay processes. Calculations indicate that element 126 would decay via alpha emission with half-lives that can vary significantly, which conflicts with the geologic age of the Earth.

- **Large electrostatic repulsion in superheavy elements**: The expected short half-lives of superheavy elements are attributed to the large electrostatic repulsion between protons, which leads to increased likelihood of spontaneous fission as atomic numbers exceed 100. Additionally, the probability of radioactive decay increases as coulomb forces grow stronger.

- **Instability of superheavy elements**: The shell model of the nucleus can potentially mitigate these instabilities under certain conditions when proton and neutron shells are filled, providing a barrier sufficient for longer nuclear lifetimes. However, the threshold for this shell condition is still hypothetical, with estimates suggesting a "magic number" of 114 protons and 184 neutrons.

- **Tricky calculations for stability**: The calculations used to determine the stability of superheavy elements are complicated because they rely on models developed for lower mass nuclei. Small variations in parameters can lead to significant changes in predicted nuclear lifetimes.

- **Creation processes of superheavy elements**: A major concern for theorists is whether superheavy elements were formed through nucleogenesis in stars, particularly during the r-process in supernovas. It's believed that the spontaneous fission might interrupt this process, making the formation of superheavy elements unlikely.

# SUPERHEAVY ELEMENTS: CONFIRMATION FAILS TO MATERIALIZE [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Gamma ray emission confusion**: An experiment by John Fox and his team found that the gamma ray emitted by praseodymium during relaxation had the same energy as the x-ray peak attributed to the supposed element 126, challenging its existence. This suggests that the apparent presence of superheavy elements may instead be attributable to more commonly understood isotopes.

- **Lack of evidence in x-ray experiments**: An investigation from Oak Ridge National Laboratory failed to find conclusive evidence of superheavy elements, reinforcing skepticism about their existence. Despite this lack of confirmation, the origin of the giant radiohalos remains an unresolved mystery. 

# GIANT HALOES IN MICA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Mechanism explaining giant haloes**: Researchers suggested that water in a cleavage plane containing radioactive impurities can enhance the range of emitted particles, leading to larger halo sizes. This is possible due to the interaction of alpha particles with water, allowing them to travel further.

- **Radiation damage and crack formation**: The large inclusions of radioactive material can create cracks in mica, which may result from temperature or pressure changes or swelling due to radiation damage. Water filling these cracks could extend radiation damage by allowing radon to diffuse further from the source.

# THE AGE OF THE EARTH [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Ionization effects of radioactive elements**: The dimensions of the pleochroic halo can help deduce the historical rates of radioactive elements’ decay. The findings of ionization curves have been pivotal in reconstructing timelines of radioactivity over geological history.

- **Deviation in alpha-ray ranges**: There is a notable misfit in ranges observed in uranium haloes compared to expected values from modern measurements. This discrepancy suggests that the historical decay rate of uranium to lead may have been faster than current rates, implicating the possibility of variable transformation constants over time.

# RADIOHALOS IN COALIFIED WOOD [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Recent uranium infiltration**: The discovery of embryonic halos with high ratios of U-238 to Pb-206 indicates that uranium infiltration might have occurred more recently than previously thought. This suggests that the conditions under which uranium was introduced into coalified wood were conducive to high transport rates of radionuclides. 

- **Shape variations in radiohalos**: The identification of elliptical halos from uranium daughters points to dynamic processes of radionuclide transport prior to coalification. These findings challenge existing narratives about the timing and mechanisms of radioactive element distribution in geological formations.
# Anomalies in Coalified Wood  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Higher Uranium/Lead Ratios**  
  The EMXRF analysis revealed that the 238U/206Pb ratios in the radiocenters were unexpectedly higher by at least two orders of magnitude than what is typically found in coalified wood. This suggests that the uranium present has barely decayed to lead, indicating that the coalified wood may be significantly younger than the accepted geological age of the strata it is found in.

- **Embryonic Halos**  
  The halos around the uranium sites are described as embryonic, lacking the fully developed structures that would typically be expected if the radiocenters formed during the Triassic or Jurassic periods. This observation raises questions about the time scales generally accepted for uranium infiltration and coalification processes.

- **Chattanooga Shale Specimens**  
  In studies of coalified wood fragments from the Chattanooga shale, embryonic halos were also observed along with significantly high 238U/206Pb ratios, which do not correlate with the expected geological age of the formation. The low uranium content in this shale complicates the justification for these unusually high isotope ratios, further challenging the remobilization hypothesis.

- **Implications on Geological Age**  
  If remobilization of uranium is not the explanation for the high ratios, then these findings raise critical questions about the established concepts of the ages of these geological formations. The evidence suggests that coalified wood formations could indeed be dated to the time of the Flood, thereby challenging long-held beliefs about geological timescales.

# Anomalies in Giant and Dwarf Halos  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Giant Halos with Inner Bleached Regions**  
  A subset of giant haloes found in Swedish biotites exhibited an unusual inner bleached region that varies in size and is surrounded by a highly radioactive inclusion. The presence of these bleached regions amongst only a fraction of the halos indicates a different formation process than previously assumed and invites further investigation into their origins.

- **Diffuse Boundaries in Giant Halos**  
  Unlike earlier reports, the giant halos described in the findings possess diffuse boundaries and can be associated with both uranium and thorium-rich inclusions. The inconsistencies with earlier findings highlight the need for a reevaluation of the conditions under which these giant halos formed.

# Anomalies in Polonium Halos  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Lack of Uranium Association**  
  The polonium halos have been observed without accompanying uranium rings, suggesting a unique formation mechanism that separates polonium from its radioactive ancestors. This separation indicates a very limited number of possible processes during which polonium can be concentrated into what ultimately becomes the halo center.

- **Random Distribution and Microconduits**  
  Many polonium halos are randomly located, while others appear to cluster along microconduits. This discrepancy implies differing mechanisms of infiltration, with some concentrations being the result of hydrothermal solutions that moved through specific pathways within the rock matrix, suggesting a complex history of mineral formation.

- **Henderson's Observations**  
  Henderson noted that to explain the random occurrence of polonium halos, it was necessary to consider a scenario where uranium-bearing solutions permeated micas along entire cleavage planes rather than strictly along channels. This observation underscores the necessity of understanding the fluid dynamics in geological formations to accurately interpret the formation of these unique halos.
# ANOMALIES IN DATING METHODS [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Modern Ore Dating Anomaly**  
  The ore in question is suggested to be significantly younger than the conventional dating estimate of 640 million years. This presents a challenge to the reliability of traditional dating methods based on decay rates of certain isotopes.

- **Potassium-Argon Dating Issues**  
  Potassium-argon dating overlooks the substantial presence of argon-40 and the uncertainties surrounding half-lives of various isotopes. This raises questions about the accuracy of age estimates derived from this method.

- **Radiocarbon Dating Discrepancies**  
  Radiocarbon dating of various civilizations shows results that are much older than reality when compared to a global sea-level cycle. This suggests that the radiocarbon equilibrium model may not accurately represent the actual ages of these civilizations.

- **Anomalous Uranium-Lead Ages**  
  Discrepancies exist in ages derived from isotopic ratios of uranium and lead, which are critical for establishing geological timelines. The finding indicates that a significant number of mineral samples yield conflicting ages, complicating the absolute geologic time scale.

- **Non-Concordant He/U Ages in Corals**  
  He/U dating on certain corals from the Cenozoic era shows inconsistent data, particularly in some Eocene samples. This inconsistency indicates potential issues with the reliability of U-series ages for coral samples.

- **Older Shells Compared to Charcoal**  
  Radiocarbon dating revealed shells that appear to be thousands of years older than dated charcoal from the same region. Scientists are puzzled by this discrepancy, which suggests that the materials may not be contemporaneous as presumed.

- **Discordant Ages in Metamorphosed Sediments**  
  Rb-Sr and K-Ar age measurements show significant discordance, with K-Ar ages being much older than Rb-Sr ages in a study of pelitic schists. This inconsistency implies that metamorphic processes can significantly affect the reliability of radiometric dating.

- **Pseudoisochrons in Young Volcanic Material**  
  Volcanic rocks often present isotopic compositions that create pseudoisochrons indicating inflated ages. These findings suggest that ancient lithosphere could be influencing current volcanic age estimates, leading to potential misinterpretations in geological history.

- **Uncertain Dating of Deep-Ocean Basalts**
