# GLA AURORA-LIKE PHENOMENA [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- **Anomalous auroras' origins**  
  Anomalous auroras exhibit uncommon formations that are difficult to explain, such as misty parallel bands in the sky. The reasons for their geometric arrangement pose significant questions about solar and gravitational influences.

- **Low-altitude auroras**  
  Some rare auroras seem to approach the earth's surface, contradicting the notion that they form only above 80 kilometers. Records of auroral fogs and sounds indicate a complex interaction between terrestrial electricity and the upper atmosphere.

- **Linkage to other atmospheric events**  
  Auroras demonstrate puzzling links to daytime clouds, thunderstorms, and earthquakes, suggesting that the earth's electromagnetic activity is intricate. Such connections further complicate the understanding of auroral behavior and its triggers.

- **Electric-blue flashes and brightening skies**  
  Unusual phenomena such as electric-blue flashes or luminous bubbles that illuminate the sky have been observed. These displays are enigmatic and extend beyond the typical characteristics of auroras.

- **Auroral pillars' origins**  
  Long-lived auroral pillars, appearing well away from typical auroral activity zones, may originate from different mechanisms. While their formation is related to charged particles, the exact origins remain contentious among scientists.
# Anomalies [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Zodiacal Light**: This phenomenon is described as a faint, diffuse light that appears in the night sky, generally in the vicinity of the ecliptic plane. Observed mainly near sunrise or sunset, it is caused by sunlight scattering off tiny dust particles and is not consistently visible in all locations.

- **Auroral Arches**: Auroral arches appear as narrow, bright bands of light across the sky, often white or greenish-white in color, with rare reddish examples. They can drift slowly, are almost always perpendicular to the magnetic meridian, and typically last about 30 minutes to several hours.

- **Observation of a Luminous-Tube Phenomenon**: In this instance, a bright luminous tube phenomenon was reported at Alton Barnes in 1991, indicating a unique visual display. Such phenomena involve bright, often linear structures of light that can appear intermittently in varying environmental conditions.

- **Red Streak in the Sky**: Reported in Poughkeepsie on March 16, 1923, this anomaly was characterized by an unusual red streak seen in the sky. It drew attention due to its striking color contrast against the backdrop of the night sky, which may allow for various interpretations.

- **Auroral Display Investigations**: In 1933, investigations into whether a certain light display was truly auroral suggested that such remnants of light can evoke historical phenomenological comparisons. This inquiry highlights ongoing efforts in scientific communities to classify and understand anomalous light events.

- **Luminous Mist Observations**: In Texas, a luminous mist observed in 1890 led to confusion among train passengers, initially thought to be a prairie fire. The mist's unique appearance suggested a painting effect against the sky, blending with the surrounding environment.

- **Gigantic Searchlight Appearance**: Observed on March 11, 1929, a phenomenon resembling a gigantic searchlight made an acute angle with the horizon, displaying distinct sections above it. This report showcases how extraordinary light displays can captivate viewers and lead to varied descriptions based on their unique characteristics.

- **Parallel Internal Motion of Auroral Arches**: The parallel motion and presence of three arches observed over four hours in Connecticut in 1872 indicated symmetry. This finding suggests that auroral phenomena can have complex moving components that defy simple explanations within typical models of auroral behavior.

- **Blood-red Masses**: The phenomenon noted in 1871 had blood-red masses with waves moving rapidly within the observed arch. This vivid imagery paints a picture of dynamic and striking displays, highlighting the variety of colors and intensities that auroral events can exhibit.

- **Isolated Auroral Arches in England**: Reported occurrences indicated isolated auroral arches that were consistent across multiple observations. These anomalies raise questions about regional conditions necessary for auroral phenomena and their presentation in historical context.

- **Okanagan Arc**: This phenomenon in British Columbia, noted for extending horizon to horizon, challenges conventional understandings of auroral behavior since such arcs do not typically follow a north-south orientation. The unique observable characteristics suggest that not all auroral displays conform to recognized patterns.

- **Early Observation of Auroral Arc**: The earliest recorded instance of a complete auroral arc dates back to March 27, 1781, illustrating the historical continuity of phenomena often thought to be modern. The description indicates a striking visibility and clearly defined boundaries uncommon in typical auroras.
# GLA3 Auroral Meteors [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

Despite the vastly different environments of auroras and thunderstorms, the possibility of coupling forces between the two phenomena remains an area of interest.

- **Observational Evidence**: Cases exist that hint at such correlations, yet most are anecdotal rather than extensively documented. Observations suggest that the occurrence of thunderstorms could reduce auroral visibility, indicating a reciprocal relationship where one event can influence or replace the other under specific conditions.
# Auroras Correlated with Thunderstorms  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- Anomaly: The immediate increase in thunderstorms in lower latitudes and probably auroras in higher latitudes when dark spots appear on the sun is noted. Conversely, when auroras become visible nearer the equator, there is a temporary decrease in thunderstorms, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between these phenomena.

- Anomaly: Instances of auroras in the United States coinciding with unusual electrical storms in Europe and vice versa indicate a correlation between these two phenomena. This relationship reinforces the understanding that both auroras and thunderstorms serve as mechanisms for transferring electrical charge between the Earth and ionosphere.

# GLL1 Luminous Phenomena above Thunderclouds  [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Sprites**: Sprites are short-duration reddish flashes in the ionosphere that can extend down into thunderclouds. They are often observed in conjunction with a second type of upwardly directed discharge called blue jets.

- **Blue Jets**: Blue jets are described as narrowly collimated beams of blue light that propagate upwards from thunderstorms at speeds of around 100 km/s. They typically reach terminal altitudes of 40-50 km above the thunderstorm clouds.

- **Elves**: Elves are brief flashes of light that occur at the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere, forming a doughnut shape. These emissions last for less than a millisecond and often appear alongside sprites.

- **Blue Starters**: Blue starters are yet another type of luminous phenomenon observed above thunderstorms, characterized by bright blue flashes that originate from cloud tops. They differ from blue jets by their significantly lower terminal altitude, reaching a maximum of around 25.5 km.

- **Potential Triggering Phenomena**: The appearances of sprites, blue jets, elves, and blue starters might be influenced by external factors such as meteors or cosmic rays creating ionization in the upper atmosphere. This suggests a mechanism where luminous phenomena occur more frequently amidst electrical disturbances from powerful thunderstorms.


# GLL2 Bead Lightning [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Bead Lightning Description**: Bead lightning appears as luminous segments that dissolve into spherical forms or sometimes rectangular shapes as the lightning stroke fades. This phenomenon can persist for 1 to 2 seconds and has various names, including pearl lightning and segmented lightning.

- **Background and Doubts**: Historically, bead lightning, like ball lightning, has been met with skepticism, with some scientists attributing it to the afterimage effect from intense lightning flashes. However, numerous visual accounts and photographs challenge this conception, indicating it as a real physical phenomenon.

- **Anomaly Evaluation**: While the spherical segments of bead lightning may find explanations through plasma physics, the rectangular segments still lack a clear rationale. This presents a significant scientific question regarding their true nature.

- **Potential Explanations**: Bead lightning formation might occur due to longitudinal waves set up during an ordinary lightning stroke, influenced by some perturbation. An earlier belief held that the glowing beads were burnt pieces of matter left behind after the lightning stroke.

- **Example Observations**: Historical accounts describe dramatic sightings of bead lightning, such as during a thunderstorm in Paris where lightning appeared as a string of brilliant grains streaking towards the ground. In another instance, observers saw luminous beads form a trail resembling a spinal column due to lightning hitting the sea.

Herring noted that many marine light wheel observations stem from steel-hulled vessels, but earlier reports from wooden ships indicate that engine vibrations are not the sole contributor to the phenomenon. An ironic contrast exists in the early occurrence reports from regions where light wheels are less common, suggesting prominence in the Indo-Pacific region.

- Herring's review indicated a geographical restriction where marine light wheels are primarily observed between certain latitudes, sparking inquiry into why significant portions of the ocean remain unreported. The bioluminescent origin of the lights is widely accepted, yet the patterns they form continue to be a mystery in marine sciences.
# Anomalies in Marine Light Displays [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)

- **Bioluminescent Organisms Emitting Light**
  - The disturbance caused by seismic waves is challenging to comprehend, particularly when considering the complex patterns observed, such as spoked wheels. An interesting observation is that in seismically quiet areas, such as the Gulf of Thailand, marine light wheels are still relatively common.

- **Interference Patterns from Vessel Bow Waves**
  - Surface waves can create interference patterns when they interact with a vessel's bow waves, potentially leading to unexpected visual phenomena. However, the existence of rotating, spoked wheels makes it difficult to fully explain these occurrences using surface wave interactions alone.

- **Illusions of Perspective**
  - Some theorists suggest that marine light wheels may only appear to certain observers due to perspective, leading them to see incomplete "half-wheels." Contrary to this theory, the consistent observation of complete wheels indicates that perspective may not be the sole explanation.

- **Influence of Vessel Engine Vibrations**
  - It has been proposed that the vibrations of a ship's engines might influence the bioluminescent patterns observed in nearby waters. Although the frequency of marine engines aligns with the flashing frequency of bioluminescent displays, the precise impact of engine noise on these patterns remains untested.

- **Role of Electromagnetic Waves**
  - There is evidence suggesting that electromagnetic waves are not required for the formation of marine light wheels, as numerous observations predate radar usage. However, it is known that radar can modify bioluminescent phenomena, leading to speculation about the separation between the causes of light emission and pattern formation.

- **Atmospheric Electromagnetic Phenomena**
  - Herring’s analysis of marine light wheel phenomena fails to consider the effects of atmospheric electromagnetic phenomena, such as plasma vortices or electric discharges. The mist-like appearance of bioluminescent displays and their elevation above the water's surface bear a resemblance to the characteristics of certain GLD phenomena.

- **Expanding Phosphorescent Rings**
  - This anomaly features rapidly expanding phosphorescent rings emanating from central points in the water, with multiple sources potentially contributing to the phenomenon. Observed rings often defy simple explanations, as they travel faster than water waves but slower than sound waves, suggesting unknown light sources and precise geometric patterns.

- **Complex Bioluminescent Displays**
  - Observations of bioluminescent displays have revealed instances of expanding concentric rings that exhibit unique patterns and colors, adding to the complexity of marine bioluminescence. The simultaneous appearance of varying displays raises questions about the mechanisms driving these phenomena.

# GLW7 Phosphorescent Spinning Crescents [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Spinning crescents of light have been observed rotating around a ship, often reversing their direction of rotation while displaying bilateral symmetry. The origins of this phenomenon may be influenced by ship-created forces, like radar or engine noise, but the exact cause remains unclear.

- Many observations of this display do not show a typical ship-centered pattern, indicating a potential stimulation mechanism from the vessel itself. These patterns are variable and exhibit enough similarities to be classified under the same anomaly, earning a rating of 2.

# GLW8 Zigzag Phosphorescent Flashes [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- This phenomenon consists of zigzag flashes of phosphorescence moving across the sea's surface in a manner reminiscent of lightning. It has only been observed once, leading to a low rating of 3 due to the rarity of observations.

- The appearance of these well-defined zigzag patterns raises questions about their origin, as bioluminescent organisms typically produce simpler light patterns. The most plausible explanation is that this behavior results from cooperative bioluminescent activity or perhaps an unusual environmental stimulus.

# GLW9 Milky Seas [(top)](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/corliss/)
- Milky seas manifest as extensive, brilliant phosphorescent displays that can cover vast ocean areas, resembling a field of snow at night. Sometimes lit from below or creating a luminous mist above the surface, milky seas can appear suddenly and last for hours.

- The phenomenon is assumed to arise from bioluminescent organisms, like bacteria, although no specific species has been identified. Observations show that despite extensive reporting of milky seas, water drawn from them frequently reveals no bioluminescence, indicating that much is still unknown regarding its causes and mechanisms.
