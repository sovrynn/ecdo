# Plasma Filaments

- **Topic Covered**: Plasma filaments as a source of solar storms.
- **Characteristics of Plasma Filaments**:
  - Magnetically suspended ropes of plasma in the sun's atmosphere.
  - Can take various shapes: upright, flat, or irregular.
- **Common Misconception**: Coronal cavities mistaken for UFOs; they are frequent and not related to UFOs.
- **Eruption Behavior**: 
  - Filaments can erupt violently without a pre-eruption solar flare warning.
  - Eruptions can lead to dense and dangerous coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
- **Historical Context**: 
  - In 13 years of observations, dense cores of filaments have not impacted Earth, but future occurrences are expected.
  - Approximately 50% of geomagnetic storms studied are from filament eruptions.
- **Danger Level**: Dense CMEs from filaments could be substantially more harmful than those from solar flares.
- **Summary of Solar Storm Sources**: 
  - Three types of solar storms: solar flare-driven CMEs, coronal hole-driven solar wind, and erupting plasma filaments.

# Solar Storm Impact - What to Expect

- **Solar Storm Overview**: Emphasis on the selective impact of solar storms rather than a global failure.
- **Common Effects**: Smaller solar storms usually cause localized issues; not every circuit is affected.
- **Historic Examples**: Blackouts in Quebec (1989) and Norway/Sweden (2003) were due to single systems failing, not total destruction.
- **Satellite Failures**: Typically, only one component fails in satellites; the loss of multiple Starlink satellites in 2022 was unusual.
- **Network Impact**: Failures tend to affect only critically connected systems; not a complete internet shutdown (e.g., airlines' systems crashed in 2015 but others remained unaffected).
- **Localized Vulnerability**: Some areas can be severely impacted while nearby locations remain unaffected due to selective energy transfer.
- **Future Projections**: Anticipate more solar storm events, stressing the importance of understanding their selective effects.

# SOLAR FORCING

- **Topic**: Short-term impacts of solar forcing on weather patterns
- **Key Findings**:
  - Clouds react strongly to solar eruptions and geomagnetic storms.
  - Solar wind, protons, and cosmic rays affect cloud condensation nuclei and weather systems.
  - Ionospheric impacts are immediate due to solar activity, influencing global electric circuits.
- **Mechanics of Weather**:
  - High pressure: air descends, flows outward, relates to downward electric currents.
  - Low pressure: air converges, rises, influenced by upward electric currents.
- **Global Electric Circuit**:
  - Integral to understanding atmospheric electricity affecting weather variables (wind, precipitation, temperature).
  - Rapid response to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
- **Connection to Storms**:
  - Solar activity correlates with the formation and intensity of tropical storms (hurricanes, cyclones).
  - Recent studies support the link between solar forcing and storm tracks.
