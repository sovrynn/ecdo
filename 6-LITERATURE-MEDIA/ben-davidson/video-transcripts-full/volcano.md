# Earth Catastrophe Cycle

- Earth Catastrophe Cycle explores the impact of potential events like micronovas or pole shifts on human survival.
- Micronovas could vary in intensity; subsequent cycles may be weaker, providing hope for human endurance.
- A significant challenge post-catastrophe is the lack of electricity, affecting globalized societies heavily.
- Wind speeds outside the equator exceed Earth’s rotational speed, making wind a critical factor in catastrophes.
- Ocean movements are less amplified compared to wind due to slower trailing behind rotation changes.
- Rotation slowdowns result in gradual ocean rises rather than sudden tsunamis, offering survival chances.
- Earth’s tilt changes, possibly due to crust unlocking, affect localized water levels and tsunami patterns.
- Tsunamis are primarily caused by seismic activities rather than rotation changes alone.
- Future episodes will discuss actions and preparations for mitigating ocean impacts and the possibility of an ice age following a catastrophe.

# Fatal Flaw In Climate Change Science

- Modern climate scientists have not made mathematical errors and their consensus is based on the same data.
- Every climate study is considered flawed due to an oversight in accounting for natural variability.
- The equation for climate change includes natural variability (sun, albedo, volcanoes, Milankovitch cycles) and human impacts (carbon emissions, deforestation, urban heat islands).
- The flaw lies in the underestimation of solar forcing, focusing only on ultraviolet changes while ignoring other forms of solar activity.
- Major solar storms show up as decreases in solar forcing, which are attributed to human-induced warming.
- Since the 1970s, solar forcing has been calculated based on ultraviolet light, neglecting x-rays, solar wind, and energetic particles.
- Studies show that solar activity influences Earth's climate through oscillation and circulation modulations, affecting phenomena like El Niño and La Niña.
- The upcoming CMIP6 models will include cosmic rays and medium energy electrons for the first time, but without x-rays.
- Adding medium energy electrons to the equation nearly nullifies the impact of CO2.
- Data selection is crucial; for example, spring snow cover declining while winter and fall snow cover increasing.
- Volcanic forcing is underrepresented in current data, impacting the understanding of historical climate patterns.
- Solar maximum periods show significant energy injections, which are currently attributed to human activities.
- Including particle forcing in climate models could significantly alter conclusions about human impact on climate.

- Every year, a major climate update or prediction is provided; in 2012, it was for record cold in the winter of 2013; in 2014, it was a prediction of a record El Niño to end the global warming pause.
- Three critical facts are highlighted: climate change is real and intensifying, humans impact the ecosystem and climate, and pollution is a significant issue affecting air, water, and soil.
- Despite predictions, the record El Niño events in 2015 and 2016 did not reach predicted temperature levels, indicating ongoing challenges in climate forecasting.
- The global warming pause is recognized by leading organizations and researchers, with explanations suggesting heat hiding in the Arctic.
- Historical temperature data suggests current warmth is comparable to past warming periods, such as the Medieval and Roman warming periods.
- The global warming pause has led to controversies, including data manipulation and academic disputes regarding climate change.
- Intellicast's 2009 article indicated skepticism about long-term cooling trends and highlighted issues with NOAA’s data collection methods.
- Recent studies suggest a gyre in the North Atlantic, known as the Buford gyre, has accumulated cold freshwater, potentially leading to a cooling effect.
- The Met Office predicts 2018 will see lower global temperatures compared to 2016 and 2015, influenced by factors including volcanic eruptions and solar activity.
- The combination of the Buford gyre releasing cold freshwater, potential volcanic eruptions, and a solar grand minimum could contribute to a cooling trend.

# Real Climate Information

- Many issues in climate science are politicized and require more scrutiny.
- Recent findings suggest volcanic impacts on climate are significantly underestimated in current models.
- Current climate models focus on a small time frame, ignoring historical volcanic data.
- Major warming occurred in the first millennium AD; significant cooling happened from the 1300s to 1850.
- A correlation exists between the decline of volcanic cooling and the recent warming trend.
- Earth's magnetic field is weakening, allowing more solar energy to enter the atmosphere.
- About 80% of the sun's impact on climate results from particle forces and magnetic interactions, not just sunlight.
- The weakening magnetic field is affecting ozone levels, contributing to modern global warming.
- The importance of volcanoes and the Earth's magnetic shift should be acknowledged in climate discussions.

# Yellowstone - Should You Be Worried?

- Yellowstone's Steamboat geyser has erupted three times this year, a sign of a healthy hydrothermal system.
- Increased geyser activity indicates stable pressure release, not imminent volcanic eruptions.

- Yellowstone’s geothermal activity and annual earthquake swarms prevent pressure build-up.
- Relatively safe living conditions near Yellowstone compared to other global volcanic threats (e.g., Campi Flegre, Central America, Indonesia).
- Effusive eruptions are possible but less dangerous than explosive eruptions, which are currently unlikely at Yellowstone.
- Animal migrations observed are seasonal and not indicators of volcanic activity.
- Overall, Yellowstone is not a major concern at this time.
