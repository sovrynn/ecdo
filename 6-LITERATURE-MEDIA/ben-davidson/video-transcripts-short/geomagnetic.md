The text summarizes recent updates on solar activity, severe weather alerts, scientific discoveries, and challenges to the theory that magnetic reversals are unlikely to cause extinctions, including notable findings from a Harvard study and major journals, with key dates such as the 23-year confirmation of a recurrent nova and the revision of Himalayan glacial ice age to between 15,000 - 74,000 years old.

In the early months of the new solar cycle, a geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal hole stream impacted Earth, while NASA's heliophysics division selected five candidate missions including STORM for studying various aspects of solar activity and space weather.

The text summarizes a period from [insert date here] to [insert date here], noting a completed four-day electric event, a significant coronal hole impact causing KP level 2 storm conditions, and two notable earthquakes, while linking solar and planetary activities to seismic events.
- [Electrodynamic Sky, Cosmos, Lightning/Magnetic Field](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/ben-davidson/video-transcripts/geomagnetic.md#electrodynamic-sky-cosmos-lightningmagnetic-field)
Increased solar activity and a record super bolt of lightning in China signal electrodynamic changes, while new research challenges the need for dark matter and discusses the risks of incorrect assumptions in gravitational wave studies, all amidst ongoing observations of Earth's magnetic field adjustments and Arctic warming impacts.

As of recent, an active solar region is expected to bring sunspots, while ongoing volcanic activity continues in Hawaii, and a video set to release discusses the impact of 2017 solar flares on ionospheric disruptions and earthquake predictions, highlighting the interplay between solar activity and seismic events.
- [Space Weather Health Alerts](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/blob/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/ben-davidson/video-transcripts/geomagnetic.md#space-weather-health-alerts)
The text describes various types of space weather health alerts, their potential cognitive and physical effects on individuals, and provides action steps for managing risks, with new research continuously being published to better understand these correlations. (Note: The text does not specify particular years, so no specific dates are included in the summary.)

Significant solar eruptions and an impending coronal holostream were observed in late 2023, coinciding with severe typhoon activity in the Philippines that caused over 100 fatalities, while new findings about Uranus suggest recent solar storms stripped its plasma, as reported around the same period.
