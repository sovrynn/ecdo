- The Beaufort Gyre has been stuck in a cold, freshwater accumulation phase for 20 years, instead of reversing every 5 to 7 years as expected.
- The accumulation of cold, less saline water in the Beaufort Gyre could disrupt the Gulf Stream and larger Atlantic circulations, potentially causing a significant cooling period similar to the Younger Dryas.
- Dr. Prochotinsky from Woods Hole mentioned that while freshwater hadn't significantly increased since 2016, signals of potential gyre release were observed in 2017.
- An expedition to the Beaufort Gyre region is planned for September to assess the freshwater release and internal dynamics of the gyre.
- The study of the Beaufort Gyre gains relevance due to its possible role in triggering major cooling events on Earth, such as the one over 10,000 years ago.

# Earth’s Magnetic Flip

- Peer-reviewed papers on electromagnetic pre-seismic anomalies have led to NASA projects and satellite launches by China and Italy to detect these signals before earthquakes.

- A decrease in solar activity this century, combined with a weaker magnetic field, may result in an increase in cosmic rays reaching Earth.
- Increased cosmic rays can influence cloud formation and potentially lead to colder temperatures, impacting climate models.
- The weakening magnetic field and increased exposure to cosmic rays could enhance the electrical processes involved in earthquakes and potentially intensify volcanic eruptions.
- Studies indicate that cosmic rays can affect the viscosity of silica-rich magma and extend the duration and intensity of volcanic activity, which can cool the Earth.

- Dr. Jonathan David Slavin from Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggested that dust from nearby novae could deliver these isotopes to Earth, but overlooked the importance of magnetic fields.
- Magnetic fields trap dust and isotopes within the nova remnant, suggesting only the Sun could deliver these isotopes to Earth.
- The solar micro-nova is essential to explain isotope evidence and aligns with solar and galactic astrophysics.
- Earth’s magnetic pole shifts every 12,000 years, coinciding with the galactic current sheet impacting the solar system.

- Research is based on the idea that mass can emerge from self-interactions, paralleling the Higgs mechanism.
- A new theory was developed that generates an additional constant force not diminishing with distance, which could replace dark matter.
- This theory necessitates accounting for external influences on galaxies, breaking Newton’s isolation theorem.
- Study of 138 galaxies shows consistent velocity predictions based solely on luminous matter.
- Claims that dark matter is unnecessary and may misinterpret universal effects, hidden in plain sight.
- Current findings include fits for 207 galaxies, highlighting that dark matter requires more parameters than the proposed model.
