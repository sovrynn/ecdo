# Most Important Space Science Discovery

- Two core revelations combined with pre-existing knowledge suggest the universe may be a scalable dipole, impacting models of deep space repulsion and attraction.
- The discovery of a dipole-repeller structure beyond the Laniakea and Perseus Pisces clusters influences the understanding of the universe’s expansion and the fine structure constant.
- Plasma cosmology predicts that expansion data is locally affected and influenced by cosmic scale fields and magnetic repulsion activities.
- Expansion data shows higher expansion near the dipole-repeller and lower expansion near attractors, aligning with theoretical expectations.
- The Milky Way is positioned centrally within the local cosmic filament, flowing from the Virgo to the Fornax clusters.
- The fine structure constant varies in one direction, suggesting a polarity in the universe's structure.
- The universe's dipole nature implies a torus-like shape, with the dipole pointing towards the strongest cosmic microwave background readings.
- Ancient cultures possibly believed the universe to be a torus, aligning with modern scientific findings.
