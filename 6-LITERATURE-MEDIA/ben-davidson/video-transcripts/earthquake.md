# The Sun Triggered Another Megaquake

- A magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck the Kermadec Islands of New Zealand 48 days ago, marking the largest earthquake in 3 years.
- The earthquake hit offshore, avoiding a devastating tsunami.
- The event aligns with predictions based on solar polar magnetic fields, specifically the Sun's 11-year cycle and Earth's annual orbit.
- Data from Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory shows the earthquake occurred at the negative peak of the Sun's south polar fields.
- The prediction model, detailed in a 2015 paper, indicates a correlation between solar polar magnetic field changes and major seismic activity.
- Additional factors such as blood echoes and global electric circuit action were also observed, contributing to the location and timing forecast.
- The model’s accuracy is further supported by historical data showing correlations between solar magnetic field spikes and large earthquakes since 2010.

# Discussing Earthquakes with Kongpop U-yen Ph.D.

- Earthquakes and solar activity share a resonant connection, where vibrations from the sun can influence the earth and vice versa.
- Long-wave vibrations exist in both solar and terrestrial systems, with the earth acting as a receiver of these waves.
- Observations indicate that significant geological events, like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, may be followed by solar eruptions, suggesting synchronicity between the two.
- Patterns observed show that the earth's seismic activity could occur a few days after solar events, often correlating with solar wind conditions.
- Upcoming geological activity is monitored, including a quake watch for specific regions due to current solar dynamics.
- The importance of a multi-indicator approach in predicting earthquakes is emphasized, as relying on a single cause may be misleading.
- An enhanced earthquake watch has been issued based on recent solar activity, planetary alignments, and historical data.
