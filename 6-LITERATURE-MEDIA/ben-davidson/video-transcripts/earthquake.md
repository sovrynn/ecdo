# The Sun Triggered Another Megaquake

- A magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck the Kermadec Islands of New Zealand 48 days ago, marking the largest earthquake in 3 years.
- The earthquake hit offshore, avoiding a devastating tsunami.
- The event aligns with predictions based on solar polar magnetic fields, specifically the Sun's 11-year cycle and Earth's annual orbit.
- Data from Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory shows the earthquake occurred at the negative peak of the Sun's south polar fields.
- The prediction model, detailed in a 2015 paper, indicates a correlation between solar polar magnetic field changes and major seismic activity.
- Additional factors such as blood echoes and global electric circuit action were also observed, contributing to the location and timing forecast.
- The model’s accuracy is further supported by historical data showing correlations between solar magnetic field spikes and large earthquakes since 2010.

# Micronova/Crust Displacement

- Lighter troll presence recently, but negative comments persist.
- Current sheet is affecting the Earth, with risks stemming from the Sun rather than the current sheet itself.
- Crust displacement is triggered by micronova energy unlocking the crust from the mantle, leading to immediate shifts.
- Lakes will also experience sloshing effects during the shift, though less intense than oceans.
- Atmospheric loss during the micronova is expected but self-correction will occur through outgassing and air exchange.
- Micronova event likened to a tense finale in a close sports game, but recovery is anticipated.
- Update on the EMP disaster vehicle: delays due to supply chain issues, pushing timeline further back.

# Yellowstone - Should You Be Worried?

- Yellowstone's Steamboat geyser has erupted three times this year, a sign of a healthy hydrothermal system.
- Increased geyser activity indicates stable pressure release, not imminent volcanic eruptions.
- Major concerns for explosive eruptions arise when geysers cease and water sources are compromised.
- Yellowstone’s geothermal activity and annual earthquake swarms prevent pressure build-up.
- Relatively safe living conditions near Yellowstone compared to other global volcanic threats (e.g., Campi Flegre, Central America, Indonesia).
- Effusive eruptions are possible but less dangerous than explosive eruptions, which are currently unlikely at Yellowstone.
- Animal migrations observed are seasonal and not indicators of volcanic activity.
- Overall, Yellowstone is not a major concern at this time.

# Discussing Earthquakes with Kongpop U-yen Ph.D.

- Earthquakes and solar activity share a resonant connection, where vibrations from the sun can influence the earth and vice versa.
- Long-wave vibrations exist in both solar and terrestrial systems, with the earth acting as a receiver of these waves.
- Observations indicate that significant geological events, like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, may be followed by solar eruptions, suggesting synchronicity between the two.
