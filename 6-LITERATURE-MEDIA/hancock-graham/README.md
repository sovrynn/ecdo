Really excellent, so much stuff I don't remember. Here's what I do:
- temples built on top of springs
- layers going back and dating much earlier, which means they reused them after they got hit by the deluge, probably sites near rivers or springs

## Season 1

Chapter 1:
- Gunung Padang, dates to pre-younger Dryas
	- has a spring at its heart

Chapter 2:
- Cholula, Mexico, world's largest pyramid
	- whole series of ancient pyramids built one on top of the other. First and oldest - 500 BC?
	- the pyramid was built over a spring
	- same apparently for Pyramid of Giza
	- theory: temples are built over special places
	- apparently built by race of giants
		- they were killed by a great flood, only few survived. Fearing that it might happen again, the giants got the help of the people of Cholula to build the pyramid
- Texcotzingo
	- aqueducts that carred water down from the top of the mountain
	- built to worship the God of rain

Chapter 4:
- Bimini Rock Formation off Miami

Chapter 5:
- Gobekli Tepe

Chapter 7:
- Turkey Derinkuyu, part of ancient bunker network. An immense effort that would have required clear purpose, not explained by war

Chapter 8:
- Channeled Scablands
	- an enormous amount of water would be required to fill this area, multiple times more than all non-oceanic water bodies on Earth combined
- Murray Springs
	- "black mat" sediment layer - extinction layer. Many megafauna fossils below that layer but none above. Also 50-60% of people in Northern Hemisphere died around this time
	- dated to onset of Younger Dryas
	- huge amount of black mat layers all over the Northern Hemisphere - Younger Dryas Impact hyothesis
