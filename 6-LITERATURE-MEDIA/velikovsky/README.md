### p1 ch 4:

pg 100: emperor yahou account

pg 103: "Thereupon Yaou [Yahou] commanded He and Ho, in accordance with the wide heavens, to calculate and movements and appearances of the sun, the moon, the reverent delineate the stars, and the zodiacal spaces; and to deliver respectfully the seasons to the people." The necessity, soon after the flood, of finding anew the four direc- tions and learning anew the movements of the sun and the moon, of delineating the zodiacal signs, of compiling the calendar, of inform- ing the population of China of the sequence of the seasons, creates the impression that during the catastrophe the orbit of the earth and the year, the inclination of the axis and the seasons, the orbit of the moon and the month, changed. We are not told what caused the cataclysm, but it is written in ancient annals that during the reign of Yahou “a brilliant star issued from the constellation Yin.”

The flood of Yahou is sometimes regarded as simultaneous with the flood of Ogyges.

In the section entitled “The Floods of Deucalion and Ogyges,” the synchronism of these devastations with the catastrophes of the days of Moses and Joshua will be demonstrated and supported by ancient and chrono- logical sources.

### p1 Chapter 5: Sun Changing Trajectory

**Page 105:** Accounts from Egypt describe the sun changing its trajectory.

**Page 108:** A depiction from Egypt shows a "reverse" constellation.

**Page 116: Exodus** - The Talmud and other ancient rabbinical sources speak of significant disturbances in the sun’s movement during the time of the Exodus, the Passage of the Sea, and the Lawgiving. In old Midrashim, it is repeatedly narrated that four times the sun was forced out of its course in the few weeks between the day of the Exodus and the day of the Lawgiving.

**Page 117:** The Midrashim describe a disturbance in the sun’s movement on the day of the Passage: the sun did not proceed on its course. According to the Psalms (76:8), “the earth feared and was still.” It is possible that Amos (8:8-9) is recalling this event when he mentions the “flood of Egypt,” at the time “the earth was cast out of the sea, and dry land was swallowed by the sea,” and “the sun was brought down at noon,” although, as suggested later, Amos might have referred to a more recent cosmic catastrophe.

**Page 119: Deucalion:** The cosmological allegory of the Greeks has Zeus, rushing on his way to engage Typhon in combat, steal Europa (Erev, the evening land) and carry her to the west. Arabia (also Erev) kept its name, though it lies to the east of the centers of civilization—Egypt, Palestine, Greece. Eusebius, one of the Fathers of the Church, assigned the Zeus-Europa episode to the time of Moses and the Deucalion Flood, and Augustine wrote that Europa was carried by the king of Crete to his island in the west, “betwixt the departure of Israel out of Egypt and the death of Joshua.”

**Page 122: Exodus:** With the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, when the Israelites left that country, the old order of seasons came to an end and a new world age began. The Fourth Book of Ezra, which borrows from some earlier sources, refers to the “end of the seasons” in these words: “I sent him [Moses] and led my people out of Egypt, and brought them to Mount Sinai, and held him by me for many days. I told him many wondrous things, showed him the secrets of the times, declared to him the end of the seasons.”

### p1 ch7 quotes

Joshua

pg 143: Many authors have dealt with the story of Phaethon; the best known version is a creation of the Latin poet Ovid. The chariot of the sun, driven by Phaethon, moved “no longer in the same course as before.”

“The earth bursts into flame, the highest parts first, and splits into deep cracks, and its moisture is all dried up. The meadows are burned to white ashes; the trees are consumed, green leaves and all, and the ripe grain furnishes fuel for its own destruction. . . . Great cities perish with their walls, and the vast conflagration reduces whole nations to ashes.”

“Then also Libya became a desert, for the heat dried up her mois- ture. . . . The Don’s waters steam; Babylonian Euphrates burns; the Ganges, Phasis, Danube, Alpheus boil; Spercheos’ banks are aflame. The golden sands of Tagus melt in the intense heat, and the swans . . . are scorched. . . . The Nile fled in terror to the ends of the earth . . . the seven mouths lie empty, filled with dust; seven broad channels, all without a stream. The same mischance dries up the Thracian rivers, Hebrus and Strymon; also the rivers of the west, the Rhine, Rhone, Po and the Tiber. . . . Great cracks yawn every- where. . . . Even the sea shrinks up, and what was but now a great watery expanse is a dry plain of sand. The mountains, which the deep sea had covered before, spring forth, and increase the numbers of the scattered Cyclades.”

pg 145: There have been and there will be many and divers destructions of mankind, of which the greatest are by fire and water, and lesser ones by countless other means. For in truth the story that is told in your country as well as ours, how once upon a time Phaethon, son of Helios, yoked his father’s chariot, and, because he was unable drive it along the course taken by his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth and himself perished by a thunderbolt-that story,
it is told, has the fashion of a legend, but the truth of it lies in occurrence of a shifting of the bodies in the heavens which move around the earth, and a destruction of the things on the earth fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals.”

147, a spot where Velikovsky seems incorrect: We do not know of any vestiges of human culture, aside from that of the Neolithic age, nor of any navigating nation, 9,000 years before Solon... hatever the source of the error, the most probable date of the sinking of Atlantis would be in the middle of the second millen- nium, 900 years before Solon,

148: The history of Greece knows two great natural catastrophes: the floods of Deucalion and of Ogyges. One of them, usually that of Deucalion, is described by Greek authors as having been simultane- ous with the conflagration of Phaethon. 

149: Eusebius placed the Flood of Deucalion and the conflagration of Phaethon in the fifty-second year of Moses’ life. Augustine also synchronizedtheFloodofDeucalionwiththetimeofMoses; he assumed that the Flood of Ogyges took place earlier.

A chronologist of the seventh century (Isidore, bishop of Seville) dated the Flood of Deucalion in the time of Moses; chronologists of the seventeenth century likewise calculated that the Flood of Deu- calion took place in the time of Moses, close to but not simultaneous
7
with the Exodus.

150: Interesting theory from Velikovsky about why Ogyges must have come after Deucalion. And that Ogyges occurred in the days of Joshua, around 1500 BC (I presume).

Apparently, the truth is with those who placed the catastrophe of
Deucalion in the days of Exodus; but those
who reckoned that
Ogyges was a contemporary of Moses were also correct, except that
Moses did not live until the Flood of Ogyges— it took place in the
days of Joshua.

### p1 ch8 - the fifty two year period

The upheaval that took place in the days of Joshua and
Agog, the deluge that occurred in the days of Ogyges, the metamor-
phosis of Venus in the days of Ogyges, the star Venus which ap-
peared in the sky of Mexico after a protracted night and a great
catastrophe— all these occurrences are related.

Chinese chronicles record that “a brilliant star appeared
in the
days of Yahu [Yahou]. [159]
