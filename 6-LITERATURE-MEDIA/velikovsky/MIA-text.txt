ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Immanuel Velikovsky, a citizen of the world, was born in
Russia in 1895, studied natural sciences at the University of
Edinburgh; history, humanities, and medicine in Moscow
(M.D., 1921); biology in Berlin; the workings of the brain
in Ziirich; and psychoanalysis in Vienna. As a young scholar,
he founded and edited the “Scripta Universitatis,” a col-
lective work out of which grew the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.
Dr. Velikovsky practiced psychoanalysis in Palestine for
more than a decade (and later in New York). Eugen Bleuler,
in a preface to Velikovsky’s article “On the Energetic of the
Psyche,” wrote (July 18, 1930): “The ideas of the author ap-
pear to me very much worthy of consideration. I, too, came
upon very similar, in essential aspects quite identical, con-
cepts.” Sigmund Freud wrote Velikovsky that he was in
complete agreement with Bleuler and that he, too, had inde-
pendently formed his own opinions on the subject, “which
come very close to yours and which, indeed, in some parts
quite coincide with them.” Wilhelm Stekel described Veli-
kovsky as “an eminent representative of the medical psychol-
ogy . . . an idealist of the first order.” And later, to Chaim
pa Ws MANKIND IN AMNESIA
Weizmann, as “one of the most highly gifted of psycho-
therapists.”*
Dr. Paul Federn said in 1947 that Velikovsky was “a ge-
nius—a great man. Excellent psychoanalyst—have sent him
some of my most difficult cases.”+
In 1939 the Velikovskys came to New York and then
moved to Princeton in 1952 ‘where he lived until his death
in 1979. He is the author of six previous books—Worlds in
Collision, Earth in Upheaval, Ages in Chaos, Oedipus and
Akhnaton, Peoples of the Sea, and Ramses II and His Time.
Kronos, a quarterly journal of interdisciplinary studies, has
featured articles by Velikovsky and studies of his work. It
is published at Glassboro State College in Glassboro, New
Jersey.
* Quoted in Ronald W. Clark, Freud, The Man and the Cause (New
York, 1980).
+ In a letter by Lawrence Kubie to Clifton Fadiman. Dr. Federn was
chairman of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.

(continued from front flap)
thought-provoking document, Veli-
kovsky undertakes to reveal the hidden
springs of our irrational behavior.
The global catastrophes of ancient
times, as Velikovsky shows, had deva-
stating effects on the human psyche.
Collectively, mankind acts like an am-
nesia victim seeking to relive a trauma-
tic experience. Though surrounded by
literary, geological, and astronomical
evidence of our violent heritage, we try
to avoid the realization that earth-
wrenching cataclysms have occurred
—as recently as a hundred generations
ago. Yet only by understanding our
past can we overcome the urge to
reenact the scene of planetary devasta-
tion, this time with man the agent as
well as the victim. The horrifying
truth, so long as it remains unrecog-
nized, is a powerful force urging us
toward doom.
“If the human race is not made able
to face its past, the traumatic experi-
ence that caused cultural amnesia will
demand repetition.” Velikovsky’s mes-
sage is imperative, for in the nuclear
age disaster may come not from the un-
chained elements, but “from the hand-
iwork of man himself.”
