EPILOGUE
A believer in Providence may think that the human race is
“chosen” from all the populations of the planets of this solar
system because this race survived the paroxysms that con-
vulsed the family of the Sun. A disbeliever may gloomily
contemplate the abysses at the rim of which our ancestors
frantically kept hold, with feet sliding and hands losing grip.
But alone we are, and our destiny is now to a greater degree
in our hands than in the hands of the unchained elements:
the elements are well chained, but we are, to use a biblical
phrase, “confounded and dismayed.” I have undertaken to
write this book because of the grave responsibility I feel, as
a historian and psychoanalyst, against keeping to myself the
realization at which I arrived, that mankind lives in amnesia
of its generic past.
The enemy is time. I conclude with a verse that is not my
own, and I do not render it exactly—but the hour is late and
I will repeat it:
We are in a race with the Reaper
We hastened, he tarried, we won.
I hope that it will be that way, and not the other way
around.
