Chapter III
IN FEAR AND TREMBLING
PLANET GODS
The agitation and trepidation preceding global upheavals,
the destruction and despair that accompanied them and the
horror of possible repetition all caused a variety of reactions,
at the base of which was the need to forget, but also the
urge to emulate. Astrologers and stargazers, as well as sooth-
sayers, divined; conquerors excelled in wanton and cruel
devastation, invoking and imitating planetary models.
Prophets and seers exhorted and priests propitiated. Astron-
omy became the dominant occupation of the sages of the
past in Mexico, in Assyro—Babylonia and elsewhere—
precisely because of the cataclysmic events that took place.
Astrology interested itself chiefly in the relative positions of
the planets and with their conjunctions. In the first century
before the present era, the Greek historian Diodorus of Sic-
ily, after recording that the Chaldeans asserted that planets
change their velocities and periods of time, says: “These
stars exert the greatest influence for both good and evil
upon the nativity of men; and it is chiefly from the nature of
these planets and the study of them that they know what is
in store for mankind.”

1033), 11.31. 4-
96 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
Diodorus’ statement
is
to
some
extent
correct,
because
of
the
great
changes
the
encounters with
other
planets
brought
upon
mankind
and everything
else
living on
this
planet.
But
from
the truth of
the
Chaldeans’
belief
to
the
wrong
conclu-
sions
was but
a
short distance.
Since the
planets
at
their
different
encounters caused
flood,
hurricane, conflagration,destruction
of
animals
or
appearance
of
new
plants,
man
could
easily
conclude
that
the
“influence”
was
the
result
of
a
special
character
of
a
planet,
which
therefore
must
be
pla-
cated.
Thus
religion
originated
with
the
worship
of
the
astral
bodies.
So did
architecture.
with
the
building
of
great
tem-
ples—the Parthenon,
built
to
honor Athene, and
the
temple
of
Zeus, of
which
a
few
large
columns
are
still
standing
in
Athens;
the
temples
to
Jupiter
in
Baalbek,
and
to
Amon,
who
was
Jupiter,
in
Karnak,
and
to
various
deities
of
thepast,
all
of
them
astral
gods.
Engineering,
too,
developed
as
a
result
of the
catastrophes,
because
the great
pyramids
in
Egypt
(the
greatest
engineering
feat
of the past)
were—in
my
understanding—royal
shelters
against possible repetitionof
catastrophic
events.
Organized warfare has its inspiration in the same terror.
As the ancient Assyrian kings went to war, they compared
the destructiveness of their acts to the devastations caused
by the astral deities at the time of the upheavals.
Since many generations saw the pandemonium of an ap-
parent theomachy, or battle of the planetary gods, it was
but natural for people on Earth to take sides. To worship the
entire pantheon simultaneously was illogical; but to worship
a selected planetary deity or deities meant incurring the
wrath of opposing deities. This dilemma was another reason
for mental disbalance in man, and in nations.
In FEAR AND TREMBLING 97
THE FEAST OF LIGHT
Most of the religious rites and observances of all creeds
have been derived from ancient mysteries that go back to
the events of the past in which celestial gods—Saturn, Ju-
piter and other planetary bodies—participated and left in-
delible memories..As an example of this notion I shall try in
this short section to convey something I understood and
wrote about, although in incomplete form, more than three
decades ago. I considered not mentioning these events here
at all, because, told with such brevity, the story may sound
fantastic. But on the chance that I will not get around to
presenting the story of Saturn and Jupiter in books (Saturn
and the Flood, Jupiter of the Thunderbolt),* I add here a
few guideposts. .
Whoever should study ancient cults and mysteries,
Osirian, Dionysian, Orphic, Eleusian, and others, would find
that they came into being to symbolize, to repeat, to imitate
the events of the past and the fates of planetary gods. I shall
not enter here this wide domain, leaving the theme to those
willing and able to master the subject. But I shall say a little
about one of these cults, the Osirian. This cult and the mys-
teries connected with it dominated the Egyptian religion as
nothing else. The myth of Osiris “is too remarkable and oc-
curs in too many divergent forms not to contain a consid-
erable element of historic truth,” according to Alan Gar-
diner.? But what historical truth is itP Could it be that of
“an ancient king upon whose tragic death the entire legend
hinged”? But of such a king “not a trace has been found be-

fore the time of the Pyramid Texts,” and in these texts Osiris
is spoken of without end. There he appears as a dead god, or
king and judge of the dead. Alternatively “he is presented
to us as the vegetation which perishes in the flood-water
mysteriously issuing from himself... .’* He is also as-
sociated with brilliant light; he was dismembered; Isis, his
spouse, went in search of his dispersed members; Isis gave
birth to Horus whom she conceived from Osiris.
James G. Frazer, the collector of folklore, came to regard
Osiris as the vegetation god; likewise he saw in Tammuz,
the Babylonian Osiris, a vegetation god. Carried away by
this concept, he wrote The Golden Bough, built around the
idea of the vegetation god who dies and is resurrected the
next year.
Of Tammuz it is also narrated that he was associated with
brilliant light, with flood, with descent into the netherworld,
visited there by Ishtar, his spouse. Osiris—or Tammuz—
death, then his resurrection, or his being found in the far
reaches but no longer brilliant, were the theme of what was
not just one of the mysteries, but the great and paramount
cult. The death of Tammuz was lamented; so was the death
of Osiris. As late as the end of the Judean Kingdom, in the
time of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in the Hebrew month of Tam-
muz women of Judea cried for the god Tammuz (Ezekiel
8:14) and a fasting was held; the same took place in the en-
tire area of the ancient East.
After a life of studying Egyptian history and religion,
Gardiner, the leading scholar in these fields, confessed that
he remained unaware of whom Osiris represents or me-
morializes.Osiris in
my
understanding
was
not
a
king but the planet
Saturn,
Cronos
of the
Greeks,
Tammuz
of the
Babylonians.
The
age of
Cronos was
the
Golden Age;
it
came
to
its
end
in

the
universal
Deluge.
The
seventeenth
day
of
Tammuz
(June-July)
was
the
first
day
of
lamentations
that contin-
ued
for
weeks.
The
seventeenth
day
of
the
month
also
plays
a
conspicuous
role in
the
story of
the
Deluge.
The “light of seven days” of which Isaiah speaks (Isaiah
30:26) refers, in my understanding, to the “seven days”
just before the beginning of the Deluge (Genesis 7:4).
The whole world was brilliantly lit: Saturn flared as a
nova. Its light was unbearably bright (“like that of a hun-
dred suns” in rabbinical lore). Saturn or Cronos, Tammuz,
Osiris—all were brilliant gods before being extinguished. A
universal deluge followed in which not only the Earth, but
the entire solar system was bathed. Water on Earth in-
creased several fold. It appears that the Atlantic, the
younger ocean, then first came into being; it was called the
Sea of Cronos. On the Earth many forms of life perished in
the Deluge, and many new genera of animal and plant life
came into being in mutations on a scale unprecedented in
human memory. This made Osiris or Tammuz or Cronos ap-
pear as a god of vegetation.
Jupiter collected much of the dispersed material and, ro-
tating ever more swiftly, underwent fission.
Saturn, prominent in the sky—possibly even the star
around which the Earth revolved—became invisible until
once again found, now with rings around it. The Greek leg-
end made Jupiter a son of Saturn, in the sense that Jupiter
took over the dominion of the sky. It was also Jupiter who
put Saturn in bonds. But in the Egyptian way of viewing the
celestial drama, it was Isis (Jupiter), the spouse of Osiris
(Saturn) who wrapped him in swaths, the way the deceased
are dressed for their journey to the world of the dead, over
which Osiris reigns.
The feast of light in memory of Saturn was observed by
100 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
the Romans as the Saturnalia at the end of December. The
observance of this festival was taken over by the Jewish
Hanukkah and then by the festival of Christmas. The ob-
servance of festivals of light was universal, because the Del-
uge had been a universal experience.
.
FIRST CENTURY: VISIONS OF APOCALYPSE
In the middle of the fifteenth century before the present
era the planet Earth passed through one of the greatest dis-
asters ever and was scorched by fire and swept by hurri-
canes and huge tides. Seven hundred years later, in the
days of Amos, Hosea, Joel and Isaiah, a new series of
global upheavals—one disaster following another at short in-
tervals—took place: the peoples of the Earth staggered at
repeated close approaches of another aster. These two pe-
riods are described in Worlds in Collision. In the series of
disasters between —776 and —687 the Earth, though moved
from its axis and orbit, fared better than seven hundred
years earlier.
When another stretch of seven hundred years had passed,
in the first century before the present era, a terror reawak-
ened in the consciousness of the peoples and manifested
itself in conceptions and expectations which betray their
source. The end of the world was feared, and in the first
century this anticipation of the end of the world grew im-
mensely. Teachings about the last days, or the new world to
come, ‘were an expression of ideas engendered by experi-
ences in the past. From the time of the Dead Sea scrolls and
of the brilliant comet that appeared in daylight for months
following the violent death of Caesar, through the days of
Jesus of Nazareth and of the Emperor Nero, of the Sibylline
oracular writings, the Book of Revelation and the fall of
Jerusalem, terror gripped the human race. :
In FEAR AND TREMBLING 101
In
the
first
century
before
the
present
era
Lucretius,
tradi-
tionally
the
prophet
of
doom,
wrote about
the
catastrophes
and
their
terror:
“The
mighty
and
complex
system
of
the
universe,
upheld
through
many
years,
shall
crash
into
ruins,”
he
predicted. “Yet I
do
not
forget
how
novel
and
strange
it
strikes
the
mind
that
destruction
awaits
the
heavens and
the
earth.
.
.
.
My
words
will
perhaps
win
credit
by
plain
facts,
and
within
some
short
time
you
will
see
the
worlds
in
com-
motion and
the
universe
convulsed
with
shocks.
. .
.
the
universe
can
collapse,
borne
down
with
a
frightful-sounding
crash.”
He
recalled the
earlier
destructions
witnessed
by
mankind,
and
the
recentness
of the
present
creation.
Since
it
is
known
that “the
generations
of
men
have perished
in
scorching
heat,
or
that
their
cities
have been
cast
down
in
some
great
upheaval
of the
world,
or
that
after
incessant
rains
rivers
have
issued
out
to
sweep
over the earth
and
overwhelm
their
towns”
it is
also
evident
“that
destruction
will
come
to
earth
and
sky.”
For
there
are
not
“bodies
lack-
ing
that can
perchance
gather
out of the
infinite
and
over-
whelm
this
sum
of
things
in
a
violent
hurricane
or
bring
in
any
other
disaster
or
danger.”
And
he
vividly
depicted
the
precariousness
of the
present
harmony:
“The
door
of
death
is
therefore
not
closed
for
the
heavens,
nor
for
the sun
and
earth
and
the
deep
waters
of
the
sea,
but
stands
open andawaits
them
with
vast
and hideous
maw.”
For
did
it
not
happen
once before
that
fire
won
out over the other
ele-
ments and brought
the
world
to
the brink
of
destruction
“when
far
from
his
course the furious
might
of the
sun’s
horses
whirled
Phaethon throughout
the
sky and
over
all
the
earth.
But
the
almighty
father [Zeus], stirred
then with
fierce
anger,
crashed
down
ambitious
Phaethon from
his car
to
the earth with
a
sudden
thunderbolt, and
the
sun,
meet-
ing
his
fall,
caught up from him
the everlasting
lamp
of the
world, and bringing back
the scattered horses,
yoked them
102 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
in
trembling,
and
then
guiding
them
on
their
proper
path,
restored
all
again.”
At
the
beginning
of the
present
era
Seneca
wrote about
the
fate
of the
human
race:
“There
will
one
day
come
an
end
to
all
human
life
and
interests.
The
elements
of the
earth
must
all
be
dissolved.or
utterly
destroyed.
. .
.
the
rock
will
everywhere
gape
in
fissures,
and
the
fresh
supplies
of
water
will
leap
down
into
the
gulfs,
and
unite
in
forming
one
great
sea...
.
A
single
day
will
see
the burial of
all
mankind.
All
that
the
long
forebearance
has
produced,
all
that
is
famous and
all
that
is
beautiful, great thrones, great
nations,
all
will
descend
into
one
abyss,
will
be
overthrown
in
one hour.”
When the appointed day comes, many causes will con-
spire to destroy the present order—“nor will such upheaval
come without the shaking of the entire world” (neque enim
sine concussione mundi tanta mutatio est).°
The Sibylline Oracles, which originated in the same pe-
riod, occupied themselves mainly with the expected catas-
trophe. The day would come when “God, Whose dwelling
is in the sky, shall roll up the heaven as a book is rolled, and
the whole firmament in its varied forms shall fall on the di-
vine earth and on the sea; and then shall flow a ceaseless
cataract of raging fire and shall burn land and sea, and the
firmament of heaven and the stars and creation itself it shall
cast into one molten mass and clean dissolve. Then no more
shall there be luminaries, twinkling orbs, no night, no dawn
. . . m0 spring, no summer, no winter, no autumn.” A comet
would presage the end: “In the west a star shall shine,
which they call a comet, a messenger to men of the sword,
famine and death.” Entire cities would disappear in chasms

In the apocryphal Book of Enoch it is said that in the final
days “the years shall be shortened, and the moon shall alter
her order and not appear in her time. . . . And in those
days the sun shall rise in the evening, and his great chariot
shall journey to the west, causing distress, and shall shine
more brightly than accords with the order of light. And
many chiefs of the stars shall transgress the order [pre-
scribed] and these shall alter their orbits and tasks and not
appear at the seasons prescribed for them.” Then Enoch saw
a vision: “. . . the heaven collapsed and was borne off and
fell to the earth. And when it fell to the earth I saw how the
earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains
were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills,
and high trees were rent from their stems, and hurled down
and sunk in the abyss.””
Similarly wrote the apostle Peter: “But the heavens and
the earth, which are now. . . reserved unto fire against the
day of judgement and perdition. . . . But the day of the
Lord will come as a thief in the night . . . the heavens shall
pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up.”
Jesus prophesied the end of the world in his days, and
when it did not come and he died on the cross he was ex-
pected to return in the days of the apostles. And why were
they “looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of
God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless
we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a

The phantasmagoriagoes on; one frightful vision is sup-

Beasts of horror march in a procession of awe.
The fearful sufferings of the whole century before Jerusa-
lem became capta in the claws of the Roman eagle, and the
next century of broken hopes and disillusionment vexed
many a soul with dread expectation of the end of the world
—when evil would perish after the good and the true that
had perished already.
It was a time when misery mounted over the power of
men to endure it. The anguish of disturbed minds produced
dreadful pictures of persecution, visions of grotesque beasts
and apocalyptic distortions. In these visions a heritage of an
archaic impression took the form of revelation.

THE
SEVENTH CENTURY
AND
THE
DARK
AGES
In the
seventh
century—the Dark Middle
Age
in
Europe—
the
embers
of
long-extinguished
fires
suddenly blew
hot
in
Arabia.
An

camel

who

in
himself
the
spirit
of
the
Lord’s
messenger, and
his
orations—the
suras
of the
Koran—
already
in
the next
generation were
carried
by
the
sword
of
conquest
to
Morocco
and
to
India.
Of
ancient
times
Mo-
hammed
(570?-632)
knew
only
what
he heard
at
random
at
the
gates of the
rabbinical
schools
of
Medina,
and
this
was
confused
in his
mind—Miriam,
sister
of
Moses, was
for
him
the
same
as
Mary, mother
of
Jesus,'t
and
Jesus the
same
as
Joshua,
son
of

Wait for the day when the sky will pour down blinding
smoke, enveloping all men: a dreadful scourge.
When earth with all its mountains is raised high and with
one mighty crash is scatteréd in the dust—on that day the
Dread Event will come to pass. Frail and tottering the sky
will be rent asunder... .
When the sun ceases to shine; when the stars fall down
and mountains are blown away . . . when the seas are set
alight . . . and the heaven is stripped bare. . . .1®
The change in the places of the stars, moving away to-
gether with the firmament, the disturbances in the Sun, the
change in the geological structure of the Earth, the boiling
and disappearance of the sea—all are images of the past.
MID-FOURTEENTH CENTURY:
A PERIODICITY OF FRENZY
Once more seven hundred years passed, and in the four-
teenth century the human race again expected doomsday. I
reproduce a description of the calamities that took place and
the terror they caused:
“The middle of the fourteenth century was a period of ex-
traordinary terror and disaster to Europe. Numerous por-—
tents, which sadly frightened the people, were followed by a
pestilence which threatened to turn the continent into an
unpeopled wilderness. For year after year there were signs
in the sky, on the earth, in the air, all indicative, as men
thought, of some terrible coming event. In 1337 a great

comet
appeared
in
the
heavens,
its
far-extending
tail
sowing
deep
dread
in
the
minds
of
the
ignorant
masses.
During
the
three
succeeding
years the
land
was
visited
by
enormous
flying
armies
of
locusts,
which descended
in
myriads
upon
the
fields,
and
left
the
shadow
of
famine
in their track.
In
1348
came
an
earthquake
of
such
frightful
violence
that
many
men
deemed
the
end
of
the
world
to
be
presaged.
Its
devastations
were
widely
spread.
Cyprus,
Greece,
and
Italy
were
terribly
visited,
and

tremor]
extendedthrough
the
Alpine valleys...
.
Mountains
sank
into
the
earth.
...
The
air
grew
thick
and
stifling.
There
were
dense and
frightful
fogs.
Wine
fermented
in
the
casks.
Fiery
meteors
appeared
in
the
skies.
A
gigantic
pillar
of
flame
was
seen
by
hundreds descending upon
the
roof of the
pope’s
palace
at
Avignon.
In
1356
came
another earthquake,
which
destroyed
almost
the
whole
of Basel.
What
with famine,
flood,
fog, locust
swarms, earthquakes, and
the
like,
it is
not
surprising that
many
men
deemed
the
cup
of
the
world’s
sins to
be
full,
and
the
end
of the
kingdom
of
man
to
be
at
hand.
“An event followed that seemed to confirm this belief. A
pestilence broke out of such frightful virulence that it ap-
peared indeed as if man was to be swept from the earth.
Men died in hundreds, in thousands, in myriads, until in
places there were scarcely enough living to bury the dead,
and these so maddened with fright that dwellings, villages,
towns, were deserted by all who were able to flee, the dying
and the dead being left their sole inhabitants. It was the
pestilence called the “Black Death,’ the most terrible visita-
tion that Europe has ever known.
“This deadly disease came from Asia. It is said to have
originated in China, spreading over the great continent
westwardly, and descending in all its destructive virulence
upon Europe, which continent it swept as with the venom of
destruction. The disease appears to have been a very malig-

nant type of what is known as the plague, a form of pesti-
lence which has several times returned, though never with
such virulence as on that occasion. . . . Villages and towns
were in many places utterly deserted, no living things being
deft24,".
“London lost one hundred thousand of its population; in
all England a number estimated at from one-third to one-
half of the entire population (then probably numbering
from three to five millions )were swept into the grave. If we
take Europe as a whole, it is believed that fully a fourth of
its inhabitants were carried away by this terrible scourge.
For two years the pestilence raged, 1348 and 1349. It broke
out again in 1361-62, and once more in 1369.
“The mortality caused by the plague was only one of its
disturbing consequences. The bonds of society were loos-
ened; natural affection seemed to vanish; friend deserted
friend, mothers even fled from their children; demoraliza-
tion showed itself in many instances in reckless debauchery.
An interesting example remains to us in Boccaccio’s Decam-
eron, whose stories were told by a group of pleasure-lovers
who had fled from plague-stricken Florence.
“In many localities the hatred of the Jews by the people
led to frightful excesses of persecution against them, they
being accused by their enemies of poisoning the wells. From
Berne, where the city councils gave orders for the massacre,
it spread over the whole of Switzerland and Germany, many
thousands being murdered. . . .”
The*religious excitement
of the time gave

of the Flagellants:
“The

and
deemed

Deity
by

and
self-tortures.
The

spread rapidly and widely.

“Women as well as men took part in these fanatical exer-
cises, marching about half-naked, whipping each other
frightfully, flinging themselves on the earth in the public
places of the towns. . . . Entering the churches, they would
prostrate themselves on the pavement, with their arms ex-
tended in the form of a cross. .
“,.. The day of judgement, they declared, was at
hand. . . . They preached, confessed, and forgave sins, de-
clared that the blood shed in their flagellations had a share
with the blood of Christ in atoning for sin, that their pen-
ances were a substitute for the sacraments of the church,
and that the absolution granted by the clergy was of no
avail. They taught that all men were brothers and equal in
the sight of God, and upbraided the priests for their pride
and luxury.
“.. . Some of them even pretended to be the Messiah,
one of these being burnt as a heretic at Erfurt... .”
The portents in the sky and the pestilence that followed
were enough to cause the frenzied expectation of dooms-
day: there was no need for a hidden cause for such a reac-
tion; nevertheless, the repetition—now for the fourth time,
always at an interval of close to seven hundred years—of
natural events startlingly remindful of the happenings in the
mid-fifteenth century before the present era, in the days of
the Exodus and the collapse of the Middle Kingdom in
Egypt, could not but add to the human terror. Such portents
could easily have been magnified in the eyes of the world’s
population because the psychic attitude was precondi-
110 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
tioned; in such a state of mind, man was also more readily a
prey to contagious diseases.
It may even appear that nature itself maintained a perio-
dicity of frenzy as if further to frighten the frightened. In
any case racial memory of the first two outbursts of berserk
elements prepared the mind for seeing, in natural phenom-
ena of the kind that may occur in almost any century, fore-
bodings of the final disaster.
Elsewhere I have described a phenomenon to which I ap-
plied the term “psychic anaphylaxis.” Anaphylaxis is a medi-
cal term for an increased reaction to a second application of
an irritant. Psychic anaphylaxis I called:
. .. That phenomenon in the psychic life of man which,
like its biological namesake, is characterized by a special
sensitivity to an agent which has at one time happened to
act on the individual, and which when again experienced
causes a second reaction far exceeding the first in intensity.
It is evident that the changes (in the body or mind) must
have been far-reaching at the time they were first produced
by the initial agent. However, the latent sensitivity they pro-
duced led to explosive acts only later through the action of
a similar agent.15
An analogous process, affecting mankind as a whole on a
time scale of centuries, may have intensified the terror that
marked the first century before this era and the seventh and
fourteenth centuries of this era. If we project this periodicity
of frenzy, occurring at intervals of approximately seven hun-
dred years, into the future, will the twenty-first century
mark another epoch of terror and frenzy? And since the pe-
riod of seven hundred years is only approximate, could the
next explosion occur even earlier? Not only will the seven-

“THERE'S NO HIDING PLACE
DOWN THERE”
In the summer of 1971 I spent some time in the Swiss
Alps and made the acquaintance of St. Clair Drake, a pro-
fessor of anthropology and sociology at Stanford University.
He heard me lecturing and came to share with me what he,
himself a West Indies black, had learned of eschatological
beliefs among various ethnic and religious groups. After I
listened to his animated narration I asked him to write down
something of it. He did so, and with his permission I present
here a few extracts from his already concise script.
“I am impressed by the extent to which conscious preoc-
cupation with catastrophes—past and present—is charac-
teristic of the adherents of some religious groups, and the
two related facts that:
a. catastrophe is invested with ‘hope,’ being seen di-
alectically as a necessary prelude to an era more reward-
ing than the present one being experienced.
b. the personality types who hold this view, in certain
groups, are not sadists (in action at least) or active par-
ticipants in the generation of human catastrophe, but
tend, rather, to be pacifist in orientation.
112 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
“I have had personal experience with, and studied, three
such groups: (a) the more unsophisticated Afro-Americans
(American ‘Negroes’); (b) Jehovah’s Witnesses; (c) Sev-
enth-Day Adventists.
“I have discerned among Africans and Afro-Americans
outside of, or who have rejected, the Judaeo—Christian tradi-
tion, the phenomenon of what I call “The Samson Complex’
—the passionate desire to create the catastrophe that will de-
stroy both them and their oppressors.
“The Christian religious ‘cult’ among the more unsophis-
ticated Afro-Americans has a strong stress in the belief that
God destroys specific civilizations or peoples occasionally
both by natural catastrophe (e.g., Sodom and Gomorrah)
and by the use of human conflicts: and that there will be fu-
ture catastrophes and a great culminating catastrophe at
‘the end of the world.’ The book of Revelation describes
how it will occur; prophecies in Matthew made by Jesus
after entering Jerusalem on Palm Sunday (first day of Pass-
over week) also referred to it graphically. When it comes,
the ‘righteous’ will be ‘saved’—either miraculously and/or by
being resurrected after their death. A thousand years of
peace and prosperity will ensue on a renewed earth—the
Millennium. This apocalyptic eschatology was shared with
white fundamentalist believers.
“Concurrently with the preaching of such ideas by ‘ex-
horters’ a beautiful religious folk-music grew up—the ‘spirit-
uals’ that express them. Here are a few examples of the Cat-
astrophic Theme:
(a) Iran to the rocks
to hide my face;
the rocks cried out,
‘No hiding place’"—
There’s no hiding place

(b) My Lord, what a morning!
My Lord, what a morning!
My Lord, what a morning! —
When the stars begin to fall
I heard the sound of the coming
of the Savior! (call)
Fare thee well; Fare thee well (response)
In that great gitting-up morning,
Fare thee well; Fare thee well
The stars shall fall from heaven,
Fare thee well; Fare thee well. ...
Like wax the mountain melting—
Fare thee well; etc.
The seas they'll be a-boiling—

“The leader sings many verses improvising all the cata-
strophic details gleaned from Old and New Testament.
“All of the spirituals with catastrophic themes are escha-
tological, referring to the last final catastrophe, when the
forces of Gog and Magog will meet in battle on the plains of
Megiddo (Battle of Armageddon), and at the end of which
the Messiah will appear (for the second time in Christian
belief) and the New Jerusalem will come down out of
Heaven ‘adorned as a bride for her husband.’ The book of
Revelation is the major source for details. As I have heard
them sung in worship services, these spirituals, sung with
great fervor and beauty, express these emotions:
(a) awe and wonder at the unusual event which Je-
hovah can and will use to bring judgment upon hu-
man history
(b) fascination with the multiplicitv of details—almost

“Jehovah’s Witnesses, or Watchtower Movement”®
“Founded by Charles Taze Russell in the second half of
the 19th century as one of many millennarian movements in
the U. S. He predicted the ‘end of the age’ in 1914. His
successor, Judge Rutherford (now dead), reworked the es-
chatological myth and set no date. Their magazine, Awake,
and other publications are constantly interpreting what they
call ‘the signs of the times’ to prove the ‘end’ is near. Their
role is to ‘Witness, not participate in, the events that express
God’s wrath. For instance, wars are inevitable and neces-
sary, but they are absolute pacifists and have been jailed in
Hitler's Germany, U.S.S.R., U.S.A., etc. for refusing military
service.
“Their publications indicate constant research in the
fields of biology, geology, astronomy, physics, archaeology,
etc. in a search for data on catastrophes, past and present,
that iridicate the end of one age and the beginning of an-
other and that indicate we are living in ‘the time of the end.’
They are usually well-written articles that do not distort the
factual data, but interpret in their frame of reference.

tury (1936), and the careful sociological study by Herbert H. Stroup, The
Jehovah's Witnesses (Columbia University Press, 1945).

“The Adventists I knew were not looking forward to pos-
sible atomic annihilation of mankind with dread and horror,
but with hopeful anticipation. They believe that this was the
mechanism by which the new earth prophesied for the Mil-
lennial Age would come into being. The great release of ra-
diation carried by fall-out all over the earth would change
the genetic structure of flora and fauna (including man).
Thus, lambs and lions could coexist happily and new men
who would not want to take up arms against each other
would be produced. Plants similar to those in Eden and
mentioned in Revelation with ‘leaves for the healing of the
people’ would exist. Adventists, being ‘saved,’ will survive
the catastrophe and their transformed bodies will exist for-
ever.
“Adventists, like Jehovah’s Witnesses, feel that God, not
they, should take human life. They will only serve in the
ambulance corps in an army. They prize forbearance, gen-
tleness, peace.
