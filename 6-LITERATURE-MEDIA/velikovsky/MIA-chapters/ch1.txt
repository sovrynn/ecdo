OF RACIAL MEMORY
AN AMNESIA VICTIM
A victim of amnesia may live adjacent to neighbors who are
completely unaware of his plight. He may be employed, he
may be married, he may behave on the surface like any-
body else. But he has forgotten everything before a certain
date. He does not know his name and he assumes a new
name to hide his own perplexity; he does not remember his
childhood and adolescence or maturity prior to that date; he
does not know the town or city from which he came and
how he got to his new habitat; he does not know whether he
was married formerly nor whether he has children. If he
comes into conflict with the law, as for instance for bigamy,
he may wind up in a psychiatric clinic; in most cases victims
of amnesia voluntarily seek psychiatric help.
Amnesia need not erase all memory; it may affect only cer-
tain areas of the past. Such cases are very numerous and
rarely is a neurotic personality free from some area of obliv-
ion; characteristically, the oblivion erases the most painful
or terrorizing reminiscences. Psychoanalysis, as Sigmund
Freud conceived it, is a tool for bringing into the conscious
mind the memories that have sunk into the subconscious
stratum of the mind. This dredging up of a partial amnesia,
if successful, is destined to heal the person of his irrational
10 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
behavior:
irrational
or
pathological
reactions
and
pursuits
are
symptoms
of
a
neurosis.
In the early days,
psycho-
analysis
was
called katharsis
by
Freud, because
by
getting
a
sick
person
once
again
to live
through
a
painful
scene,
Freud
was
able
to
restore
the
mental
health
of the
patient
and
free
him
or
her
from
pathological
reactions.
Freud’s
very
first
patient
was
a
young; lady
who became
the
victim
of
a
paralyzing
neurosis,
upon
having
submerged,
as
Freud
found,
the
most
painful
memory
of
the
circumstances
of
the
death
of
her
father
whom
she
had
nursed.
Another of the pathological forms to which an amnesia
may lead is what is called mental scotoma. In ophthal-
mology, scotoma is a partial or insular blindness; a certain
segment of the field of vision does not register on the retina
because of some defect, like detachment of the retina or a
clot of blood beneath it. Psychological scotoma is an inabil-
ity to observe certain phenomena or to recognize certain sit-
uations though they are obvious to other persons. A man
may not see an evident fact or not recognize an obvious situ-
ation, though his intelligence and rationality should produce
an immediate realization and proper reaction. The pro-
verbial husband of the promiscuous wife is the only one with
no suspicion whatsoever; psychologically, most probably, the
husband’s unawareness of such a situation is conditioned by
suppressed homosexuality producing a blindness to the state
of affairs.
Whereas the phenomenon of total amnesia is rare, the ob-
servance of partial amnesia or psychological scotoma are
daily experiences in psychiatry and psychoanalysis, and the
reader himself most probably has “succeeded” in erasing
from the conscious memory some painful occurrences,
greater or smaller, that his ego cannot face. Much of
maladjustment, failure and floundering, guilt feeling and
self-punishment, or aggressiveness, hatred and_ hostility,
pathological inclinations and sexual aberrations, criminal
Or Racrtat Memory ll
impulses and acts, suicide and murder, or detachment from
reality and flight into madness can be traced by correctly
applied analytical procedure to impressions erased from the
conscious memory, traumatic occurrences obliterated—in
short, to contents submerged. From the mind’s dark recesses
they pilot the personality toward its bizarre behavior and,
not seldom, toward a repetition of the traumatic experience.
This repetition is sought in the form of a return to the scene
of the first experience, or in a fixation on abnormal sexual
objects, or in selection of an occupation offering a regular
substitute for an act repressed from the conscious memory.
In Jenseits des Lustprinzips (Beyond the Pleasure Princi-
ple), published in 1920, as also in several others of his works,
Freud developed the thesis that “the patient cannot recol-
lect everything he repressed—and quite possibly the most
important part of it stays repressed. . . . He is, however,
urged to repeat the repressed instead of recollecting it.”
Freud spoke of this compulsion for repeating as of demo-
niac quality (triebhafter, dimonischer Charakter); the one
possessed by it “lives in a dark anxiety (dunkle Angst),
afraid of awakening something that would be better left
asleep.”
MIND’S FRONTIERS
The human mind is the least known territory, though
through it man has obtained the entire sum of his experi-
ence and knowledge. Tests are made, IQs evaluated, psy-
chological theories are written, psychotherapies are prac-
ticed, the action of drugs on the sensorium and behavior are
studied, sex hormones are explored, the inner secretions of
the pituitary gland are examined, brains are dissected, ex-
periments on animals are made—and many discoveries are
registered. But after all the efforts, some cardinal issues are
12 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
as much in darkness now as they were thousands of years
ago.
Are all the facilities of the brain subject to tests and eval-
uation? What is the thinking process? Does a person have a
soul as well as a mind? Where is its seat? Certainly it is not
in the heart, though common expression makes of the heart
a seat of the emotions. A damage to a part of the brain as in
arteriosclerosis or in a massive shock may lead to an ir-
reparable loss of memory—does the soul thus perish, and
does it die fully when the individual dies? Does the soul
have communion with unknown forces; does it survive the
body? Theology and spiritualism tear at the problem with
little evidence and unproven results.
A probe touching a cell in the brain makes a forgotten
memory vivid, so vivid that the person believes himself to
be living in a situation that actually took place many years
before.
We have seen a person susceptible to hypnosis receive an
oral order to be unable to see or to hear or to move an arm—
and comply with the order. Is this just a pretense on the sub-
ject’s part? But the same person receives an order to be like a
rigid rod and, upon being placed between two chairs, head
on one and heels on the edge of the other, he or she—even a
slight woman—in this cataleptic state can support the
weight of several persons. Whence comes this physical re-
serve, unavailable in the conscious life, to the person now in
catalepsy? And how can an oral order—nothing but sound—
mobilize this reserve?
A
person
in
hypnosis
is
given
a
suggestion
to
perform
some
act
at a
given
time,
possibly
days
after
the
hypnotic
session,
and
to
forget the
command
until
time
for
its
execu-
tion.
Without being consciously aware
of the
suggestion and
without
a
timepiece, the individual executes the
command
precisely on time. Is
it,
then, that
a
time-measuring device
is
Or Ractan MEMORY 13
implanted in the human brain? What causes forgetting and
remembering?
Least of all does the hypnotist—be he a trained psychi-
atrist or an uneducated variety performer—know what
makes hypnosis work. What are the physical and mental
reserves that can be brought into action with the simplest of
tools, a human word or gesture? The limits are suddenly so
much wider that the capabilities used in daily life seem but
one octave of a full keyboard.
At postdoctorate courses in medicine that I attended in
the early twenties in Berlin we were given a chance to ex-
amine a ten-year-old mentally retarded boy who could, with
almost the speed of a computer (then not yet in existence),
tell the day in the week of any date, such as the birthdays of
the participants in the course. If such capacity is present in
one, what makes it unattainable in others?
Dervishes in an autohypnotic state walk on burning coals
and suffer no ill effect; skin can be cut and blood ordered
not to flow. A person in a trance can reportedly speak a lan-
guage that he or she never learned or even heard. All this
was known and practiced since very early times—“to speak
with other tongues” as in Acts (2:4); to be made temporarily
blind as in Genesis (19:11) and in the Second Book of Kings
(6:18), sanverim in my understanding being the term for
hypnosis in biblical Hebrew.
Extrasensory perception is a field explored and debated
by the credulous and by the skeptical; sides are taken as if it
were a matter of conviction and not of knowledge. The ex-
periments at Duke University in North Carolina suffer from
neglect of attention to the emotional state of the sender as
well as of the recipient, as if such a state had no influence on
the transmission of thoughts or messages from one individual
to another. So much deception, voluntary or involuntary, has
been introduced into the field of spiritualism, with materi-
alization (ectoplasm), automatic writing, telekinesis, etc.,

COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS MIND
In 1930 I spent the summer on a “working vacation” in
Ziirich. During the preceding winter I had written a paper
“On the Physical Existence of the World of Thought.” In
Kiissnacht, near Ziirich, I visited Professor Eugen Bleuler,
for decades the undisputed dean of psychiatry. It was
Bleuler who opened the doors of academia to Sigmund
Freud by assigning his (Bleuler’s) assistant Carl Jung at
Burgholzli mental hospital to study Freudian theory with a
view to its application in the wards. Bleuler and Freud both
were born in 1856, but while Freud was a “loner,” rejected
and hardly ever mentioned in medical periodicals unless in
disrepute, Bleuler dominated the field.
In that paper of mine I dealt with certain problems near
the borderline of the then legitimate psychiatry: I claimed
that physical processes underlie mental processes; I main-
tained that it should be possible to make the blind see and
the deaf hear by reaching the brain centers with adequate
Or RactaL MEMorRY 15
electrical
impulses,
thus
circumventing
the
peripheral
sen-
sorial
organs.
I
postulated
engrams
in
brain
cells
as
car-
riers
of
memory—and,
it
followed,
the
engrams
could
be
re-
awakened by
suitable
mechanical
impulses. I
maintained
that
encephalograms
of
persons
suffering
from
epilepsy
would show
a
disorderly
and
violent
wave
pattern
as
if
caused
by
short
circuits:
until
then only
one
paper
on
the
en-
cephalogram
in
men—and
that
in
healthy
men—had
been
published,
by
Hans
Berger
of Jena.!
I wrote:
At an excitation of a peripheral sense organ, for instance,
an eye by a strong light, there appears a current oscillation
in the opposite optical region. ... I think it would be
worthwhile to apply the experiments of Berger on epileptics.
The lightning start of an epileptic seizure reminds me
strongly of the action of a short circuit. . . . Then it would
be proper also to experiment with the possibility of relieving
the too strong oscillations (Stromschwankungen) of the cur-
rent in the brain of the epileptics. This should be regarded
as a preliminary communication.
I also claimed the existence of a collective mind in the
early stages of the development of the species. Individ-
ualization accompanies the evolution from lower to higher
forms, yet the collective mind is never fully erased in man; it
comes to the fore preferably in excited states of mind, also
in crowds swept by emotions. On this score I wrote:
It transpires ever clearer that the autonomy of the mental
domains of separate individuals must have developed as a
more complicated and higher state in the origin of the spe-
cies. In our concept telepathy is an archaic form of thought-
transmission. The more a species is developed, the more is

Bleuler discussed my paper with me and willingly ac-
ceded to my desire that he should write an introduction to
it. In his introduction Bleuler said:
Out of a mass of superstition, illusion and deceit, facts
were retrieved for which the so-called natural explanations
failed completely; these facts are numerous enough to com-
pel science to make them the object of a very careful study.
Therefore, an attempt to bring them into correlation with
known natural laws is very useful; it can not only stimulate
scientific thought, but also help to overcome the fear—in-
compatible with science—of entering a new and very unu-
sual domain.
The ideas of the author appear to me very much worthy
of consideration. I myself came upon very similar, in essen-
tial aspects quite identical concepts, even if I cannot sub-
scribe to every detail. If the work [of Dr. V.] contributes
only so much that one would be able to speak about these
matters without being thought crazy or, at the least, in-
ferior—it already serves science, independently of how much
of its content will stand future research.
Upon my return to Mt. Carmel, near Haifa, where I then
lived and practiced, I sent the paper to Europe for publica-
tion in some journal dedicated to psychiatric research. After
one rejection, the name of Bleuler prevailed and the presti-

June, 1931
I
find
myself
in
complete
agreement
with
Bleuler
on
the
contents
of
your
paper (Energetik

I,
too,
have

my

opinions
on the
subject
which come
very
close
to
yours
and
which
in
some
parts
quite coincide
with them.
It
is
exactly
the
analyst
who
has
the
least
objection
to
an
energetic interpretation
of the
processes
of
thought.
My
own
experiences
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
telepathy
is
the
real
core
of the
alleged
para-
psychological
phenomena
and
maybe
the
only
one.
But
in
these
matters I
have
neither
experienced anything
com-
pelling
nor
have
I
found
it
anywhere
else—not
even
in
your
paper.?
Therefore,
nothing remains
to us
but
to
await
clarification
of
this
basically
physical
problem
from
the
hopefully
not
too
distant future.
With friendly greetings

The question then arises whether a collective mind is a
product merely of some process akin to telepathy, or
whether it may also link consecutive generations. This is a
highly important problem bearing on nothing less than the
ultimate fate of the human race, and with it, on the rest of
the population of the planet.
JUNGS ARCHETYPES
After ten years of Freud’s “splendid isolation”
(1895-1905), a circle of disciples gathered around him;
not many years later several of them, notably Wilhelm
Stekel, Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, built their own theories
and schools and also claimed success in therapy. Whereas
Adler stressed the sociological aspects and the urge for rec-
ognition and the will for power as the mainsprings of behav-
ior, Jung indulged in mythical subjects and searched the
world literature on alchemy, the cabala, and the dreams of
mystics to find a pathway of his own. In the study of the un-
conscious he started as Freud’s disciple, but after the schism
he denied his debt. In 1916, soon after parting with the mas-
ter, he came up with an early version of the concept of racial
memory; in this he might have been, though he would not
admit it, elaborating on some ideas Freud offered in Totem
and Tabu (1912). In that work Freud maintained that quite
a few reactions in family situations reflect some racial un-
conscious vestiges of acts, among them patricide, committed
by the cave man of the Stone Age.
In the summer of 1930 I visited Jung in his house near
Or RactaL Memory 19
Ziirich and, unaware of the degree of his antagonism toward
Freud, I referred to him as Freud’s daciple: to which he
strongly objected.
In 1934 Jung came up with the fdeh of the collective un-
conscious mind, and in the following years he developed
this concept. He wrote in his Archetypes of the Collective
Unconscious (1934):
“At first the concept of the unconscious was limited to
denoting the state of repressed or forgotten contents. Even
with Freud . . . it is really nothing but the gathering place
of forgotten and repressed contents. ... For Freud, ac-
cordingly, the unconscious is of an exclusively personal na-
ture, although he was aware of its archaic and mythological
thought-forms.”
In a footnote, Jung conceded that Freud “in his later
works” differentiated between “the instinctual psyche” of a
human being, called by him the “id,” and his “super-ego,”
which “denotes the collective consciousness, of which the
individual is partly conscious and partly unconscious (be-
cause it is repressed).”
Jung continued: “A more or less superficial layer of the
unconscious is undoubtedly personal. I call it the personal
unconscious. But this personal unconscious rests upon a
deeper layer, which does not derive from personal experi-
ence and is not a personal acquisition but is inborn. This
deeper layer I call the collective unconscious. I have chosen
the term ‘collective’ because this part of the unconscious is
not individual but universal; in contrast to the personal
psyche, it has contents and modes of behavior that are more
or less the same everywhere and in all individuals. It is, in
other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes a com-
mon psychic substrate of a suprapersonal nature which is
present in every one of us.”
The contents of the personal unconscious are, according
to Jung, “feeling-toned complexes”; the contents of the col-
20 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
lective unconscious are “archetypes.” This term is met al-
ready in the first century Alexandrian philosopher Philo Ju-
daeus, who thus called the God image in man. With Jung,
“archetypes” are archaic or primordial—they are “images
that have existed since the remotest times.” But in myth, in
“esoteric teaching,” in dreams and visions and fairy tales,
they manifest themselves: “The archetype is essentially an
unconscious content that is altered by becoming conscious
and being perceived.”
Jung realized that in myth an “unconscious psychic proc-
ess” is at work and therefore futile is the work of myth-
ologists who have “always helped themselves out with solar,
lunar, meteorological, vegetal, and other ideas of the kind”
and “absolutely refused” to see that the mythological im-
ages and contents reflect deep, ingrained psychic phenom-
ena. And “what is true of primitive lore is true in even
higher degree of the ruling world religions. They contain a
revealed knowledge that was originally hidden.” (I would
have said “a hidden knowledge that was originally re-
vealed.”)
Symbols employed in the religions are representations of
hidden contents. “Dogma takes the place of the collective
unconscious by formulating its contents on a grand scale’;
but “the Catholic way of life is completely unaware of psy-
chological problems in this sense. Almost the entire life of
the collective unconscious has been channeled into the dog-
matic archetypal ideas and flows along like a well-controlled
stream in the symbolism of creed and ritual. . . . Before the
Christiag Church existed there were the antique mysteries,
and these reach back into the gray mists of neolithic prehis-
tory.” The Church created a protective wall of sacred im-
ages. “People had long since forgotten what they meant. Or
had they really forgotten? Could it be that men had never
really known what they meant? . . . actually we haven’t the
remotest conception of what is meant by the Virgin Birth,
Or RacraL Memory 21
the divinity of Christ, and the complexities of the Trin-
ity. . . . The fact is that archetypal images are so packed
with meaning in themselves that people never think of ask-
ing what they really do mean. . . . And when [a person]
starts thinking about them, he does so with the help of what
he calls ‘reason’—which in point of fact is nothing more than
the sum-total of all his prejudices and myopic views.”*
I tried to extract from Jung a clear line of thought. Actu-
ally, however, he is hardly able to pursue one theme; in his
writing he follows the flight of thoughts or “free associa-
tions,” diverting all the time on tangents. He speaks of the
chronique scandaleuse of Olympus, of the disintegration of
Protestantism “into nearly four hundred denominations,” of
“the alarming poverty of symbols” in them, and of the void
that yawns before the modern man in need of symbols. Jung
himself winds up with a yearning for Oriental religions, con-
taining an unfathomed wisdom and symbolism not under-
stood, “the allurements of the odorous East,” the esoteric
teachings; and he professes an absorbing curiosity in, and al-
most an identification with, certain mystics and hermits of
the past centuries. The readers, however, wish to know more
of the archetypes and, if it should follow, how to apply the
teaching to the treatment of single persons, or if possible of
the human race. Drifting clouds make an opening and we
read:
Mankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods, as
ever, show it the ways of fate... . In the realm of con-
sciousness we are our own masters. ... But if we step
through the door of the shadow we discover with terror that
we are the objects of unseen factors. To know this is decid-
edly unpleasant, for nothing is more disillusioning than the
discovery of our own inadequacy. It can even give rise to

by R.F.C. Hull (Princeton University Press, 1968), pp. 3-7, 12-13.
22, MANKIND IN AMNESIA
primitive panic, because, instead of being believed in, the
anxiously guarded supremacy of consciousness—which is in
truth one of the secrets of human success—is questioned in
the most dangerous way. But since ignorance is no guaran-
tee of security, and in fact only makes our insecurity still
worse, it is probably better despite our fear to know where
the danger lies.
Jung asked the question, and let it follow by intuitively
felt concern though not by an answer:
To ask the right question is already half the solution of a
problem. At any rate we then know that the greatest danger
threatening us comes from the unpredictability of the
psyche’s reactions. Discerning persons have realized for
some time that external historical conditions, of whatever
kind, are only occasions, jumping-off grounds, for the real
dangers that threaten our lives. These are the present
politico-social delusional systems. We should not regard
them casually, as necessary consequences of external con-
ditions, but as decisions precipitated by the collective un-
conscious.®
It seems that Jung had world communism in mind; for na-
tional-socialism’s upsurge, as some scholars have brought to
light, Jung had only an attitude of sympathy and did not
describe it as a delusional system; with Judeo-Christianity
he felt an urge to part. The gods of Valhalla were closer to
him than the God of Sinai or that of Golgotha. As a Ver-
razano who saw a stream and failed to penetrate it, but
registered his discovery, Jung formulated his concept:
My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to our immedi-
ate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature
and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even
5 Ibid., pp. 13-15, 23.
Or Racta Memory 23
if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix),
there exists a second psychic system of a collective, univer-
sal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individ-
uals. This collective unconscious does not develop individ-
ually, but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the
archetypes. . . .§
“Pre-existent” means since the emergence of the human
race. What made these forms populate man’s mind was
never explained by Jung. He did not attempt to approach
the phenomenon by a study of animal instincts. In many ana-
lytical situations he saw an archetype. Thus a recurrent motif
of having had two mothers was explained as an archetype (a
simpler explanation would be in the binding ties to a mother
and a wet-nurse).Ever increasing the number of archetypes
by adding all kinds of recurring concepts, some of ques-
tionable nature, Jung moved the psychoanalytical endeavor
of his group to a recognition of archetypes in patients’
dreams and fantasies, also in behavior, and thus encouraged
his followers to ever greater application of the concept of
archetypes to trivial fantasies or patterns of behavior.
The sublime question, almost the awful quest—How did
some true archetypes enter the human mind and settle there
to plague it, and to pass from generation to generation?—
was not even asked.
FREUD’S DESCENT INTO HADES
By 1913 Freud had parted with Jung, who tended to mys-
ticism, and with Adler, who tended to socialism. In that year
Freud published Totem and Tabu, an analytical study of an-
cient and partly also of modern folklore culled mostly from
Frazer’s Golden Bough. Freud endeavored to evince from

Freud came to this understanding rather late in his ana-
lytical work. For almost a score of years he ascribed the ori-
gin of neuroses exclusively to the traumatic experiences in
the early life of a person, usually in his second to fifth years.
Freud moved slowly toward the new orientation. What he
used to call the unconscious was the personal unconscious
or, if we prefer, the subconscious; in deeper recesses of the
mind were stored racial memories; instincts, too, belong to
the racial heritage.
The longer Freud sat behind the couch and the more he
listened and thought, the more the concept of guilt feeling
for acts committed by ancestors grew in persuasiveness. Ar-
chetypes inborn in primogenitors of man were foreign to
Freud: ancestral man acquired the guilt feeling when he
committed the act of patricide. Further, he committed his
issue, not seldom an incestuous progeny, to repeat his own
act and to will to later generations the urge again to repeat
and suffer guilt—or at least to imitate in an unconscious urge
and stillsuffer guilt. A traumatic experience in an individual
asks to be repeated; to the traumatic experiences of his an-
cestors he is an heir. Freud knew of no other paramount
trauma that could become a source of universal guilt feeling.
In “From the History of an Infantile Neurosis” (1918),
Freud explained the universality of certain symbolic expres-

sions in speech and in various fantasies, usually connected
with parental coitus and the related castration fears, as
grounded in persisting unconscious memories of archaic sit-
uations.
We must finally make up our minds to adopt the hypothe-
sis that the psychical precipitates of the primeval period be-
came inherited property which, in each fresh generation,
called not for acquisition but only for awakening. .. . We
find that in a number of important relations our children
react, not in a manner corresponding to their own experi-
ence, but instinctively, like the animals, in a manner that is
only explicable as phylogenetic acquisition.®
A neurotic state results from triggering an explosive pre-
cipitate inherited from ancestral generations.
Early trauma-—defence-latency—outbreak of neurotic ill-
ness—partial return of the repressed. Such is the formula
which we have laid down for the development of a neurosis.
The reader is now invited to take the step of supposing that
something occurred in the life of the human species similar
to what occurs in the life of individuals: of supposing, that
is, that here too events occurred of a sexually aggressive na-
ture, which left behind them permanent consequences but
were for the most part fended off and forgotten, and which
after a long latency came into effect and created phenomena
similar to symptoms in their structure and purpose.®
Here Freud assigned equal roles to the personal and to
the inherited trauma:

tutional factor, the more readily will a trauma lead to a fixa-
tion and leave behind a developmental disturbance; the
stronger the trauma, the more certainly will its injurious
effects become manifest even when the instinctual situation
is normal.1°
But can the “instinctual situation” be normal if everyone
in the human race is a carrier of traumatic experience of
earlier generations? Freud is not yet clear. Averse to use any
Jungian terms or concepts, he delineated as “id” the uncon-
scious domain of a person, a repository of the phylogenetic
and instinctual heritage and equally so of personal experi-
ences and reactions repressed and forgotten due to their
traumatic character.
It [the id] contains everything that is inherited, that is
present at birth, that is laid down in the constitution—above
all, therefore, the instincts, which originate from the somatic
organization and which find a first psychical expression here
[in the id] in forms unknown to us.14
This passage was inserted by Freud in 1938 into his Out-
line of Psychoanalysis. Likewise the following passage was
included by him as the result of his analytical experience be-
tween 1913 and 1938:
Some portion of the cultural acquisitions have undoubt-
edly left a precipitate behind them in the id; much of what
is contributed by the super-ego will awaken an echo in the
id; not a few of the child’s new experiences will be in-

tensified because they are repetitions of some primeval phy-
logenetic experience.?2
Since many instinctual reactions and arrangements serve
the species and even enable it to survive, a demarcation line
needs to be drawn between the heritage of instincts of
beneficial purpose and the deeply imbedded phylogenetic
memories of violent traumas. Likewise, Oedipal attachment
and parricide do not belong in the same group with instincts
serving survival. Nor do the personal traumas repressed into
oblivion belong in the same category or come to be stored in
the same layer of the unconscious as “something that oc-
curred in the life of the human species,” as Freud put it, “of
a sexually aggressive nature.”
These are some of the most important postulates of the
psychoanalytic theory as formulated by Sigmund Freud—
they concern the traumatic experiences, their frequent sup-
pression and removal from the conscious memory, the urge
to relive them and by doing so to inflict a similar trauma on
somebody else, thus reversing the roles.
Freud says in Jenseits des Lustprinzips (Beyond the
Pleasure Principle):
At the outset he [the child] was in a passive situation—he
was overpowered by the experience; but by repeating it,
unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an active
part. . . . As the child passes over from the passivity of the
experience to the activity of the game, he hands on the disa-
greeable experience to one of his playmates and in this way
revenges himself on a substitute.1?
In the traumatic experience terror and anguish play the
decisive role. Sometimes the memory of the traumatic expe-

rience is not forgotten and yet the urge to relive it may per-
sist; but the urge to relive is definitely greater when the ex-
perience itself is repressed and relegated to the subconscious
mind. The victim of amnesia caused by a traumatic experi-
ence lives under the urge to repeat the experience, often re-
versing the roles, himself becoming the aggressor and inflict-
ing punishment on a new victim.
OF RACIAL MEMORY
Whether acquired characteristics are inheritable is a ques-
tion that has generated scientific debate and inquiry since
the days of Lamarck. He was a proponent of such inherit-
ance and it is usually asserted that Darwin, two generations
later, was its opponent. The truth is that Darwin in his
theory of gemmules (1868) subscribed to the view that each
cell in an organism sends its imprint to the reproduction
cells (germs or plasma) and that this is how inheritance of
parental features takes place; in such an arrangement ac-
quired characteristics would naturally be hereditary. New
characteristics of wheat or rye cultivated in a changed envi-
ronment could become inherited: a rugged stem could de-
velop, for instance, when a plant grew year after year in lati-
tudes of short summers, windy falls, and late springs. How
long such inheritance would persist if the plant were repa-
triated to its earlier soil and climate, is at the base of the
modern dispute about the inheritance of acquired charac-
teristics.
A change in the germ cells (sperm, ova) would result in
inheritable new characteristics; but it is assumed that only
somatic cells are susceptible to variation. Yet it cannot be
denied that chemical processes or endocrine disturbances in
an organism can decidedly influence the plasma cells, in
which case the progeny would exhibit an inherited defect
Or RacraL MEeMorRY 29
which occasionally can also be transmitted to subsequent
generations.
The question thus boils down to the problem of whether
outside influences—via the somatic cells or even directly—
can affect the germ cells. Somatic cells—which make up the
body of a living organism—live their span of time, and re-
turn to the metabolic process of nature, or to dust. The germ
cells, however, carry life for untold generations, using the
individual organism as their carrier. These cells are poten-
tially immortal, though an enormous proportion of them
goes to waste as anyone can witness who sees the seeds of
trees or pollen lost, or thinks of the billions of spermatozoa
ejected in a single copulation with usually only one of this
multitude having a chance of fertilization. Remarkable is
the endless reproduction capability stored in a single micro-
scopic sperm or egg, with inheritable characteristics for gen-
erations without end. And it is not that a spermatozoon is
inherited and multiplies again, but that the new organism
has reproductive cells which produce the new sperm and
egg. If these reproductive cells, or the sperm and egg, are
influenced by some strong chemical, thermal or radioactive
agent, the new characteristics may well become inheritable
—and this opens the way to enormous possibilities in ge-
netics.
Paroxysms in nature, accompanied by such agents, could
influence the reproductive cells of the animal and plant
kingdoms; if, as happened more than once, the area in-
volved in a paroxysm were the entire world, then chances
would be excellent for mutations to occur in many species
and genera. The germ cells could be affected not only
through the soma, or body, but also directly, with the subse-
quent origin and transmission of new characteristics. And
since the same causes could conceivably result in similar
changes, especially in forms that procreate with more than

A racial memory is not a transmigration of the soul; it is,
however, an inherited unconscious memory. And through a
racial memory we can consider ourselves as having been
present at some horrible cataclysmic scenes amid unchained
elements, devastation by which no creature in the world, on
land or in the sea, could conceivably have been unaffected.
Thus the accumulation of the genetic mnemes comes down
to every representative of the species in our days through
every one of the genealogical lines: all ascendancy reaches
back to the same generation that was exposed to the trauma.
At approaching earthquakes, animals with fine sensoria
flee, before seismographs even register any tremor. During
forest fires, animals that normally live in terror of other ani-
mals will run together with their predators, struck by a
greater ‘terror, to cave shelters.
It is quite obvious that some information—called instinct—
is being reawakened and reactivated, with fear never ab-
sent.
The racial memory of a species is a matter of fact: it tells
a wild creature how to build its nest, how to provide food,

MANKIND’S DELUSION
The octogenarian founder of psychoanalysis was not yet
at the end of his insights and revelations. A repressed
thought was asking to be spelled out.
If we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a
single individual, we discover that it too has developed
delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and
which contradict reality. If, in spite of this, they [the delu-
sions] are able to exert an extraordinary power over men,
investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case
of the single individual. They owe their power to the ele-
-ment of historical truth which they have brought up from
the repression of the forgotten and primeval past.1* [Italics
in text.]
Freud speaks here of mankind’s delusions, therefore delu-
sions in which all of us take part and which are deaf to logi-
cal criticism; at the bottom, however, is a historical truth.
What, then, is this truth, the happening that once over-
whelmed the human race and traumatized and poisoned
and scorched the minds of all generations that followed?
Was it a bedtime story? Was it a nursery discovery of every
infant? And did this drama happen as regularly as Freud
thought it did? Was the natural process of reproduction,
though not all trauma-free, devised as all aberration? Is the

We followed Freud in his early observations that a trau-
matic experience of psychic or physical nature often results
in amnesia. We further followed Freud in his realization
that a victim of amnesia either denies the trauma or makes
an effort to relive it.
When Freud, in a later and deeper penetration into the
human soul, discerned the buried racial memories of trau-
matic experiences of our progenitors, we followed Freud,
now with bated breath, once more. But we knew this time he
would fail. The great human trauma was not what he imag-
ined it to be—the killing of the father and the possession of
the mother by the grown sons now capable of overpowering
the father, the tyrant in the cave. And symptomatically, fol-
lowing his own diagnosis of behavior, Freud returned in his
last book to the days of the Exodus, only to display a sco-
toma—no plagues, no convulsion of nature, no terrifying ex-

periences at Mount Sinai, only the stoning of Moses, the fa-
ther symbol, by the children of Israel in the desert.’
Freud was nearly correct in his diagnosis when he wrote
that mankind lives in a state of delusion, but he was unable
to define the etiology: in this case, the nature of the trau-
matic experience.
In the frame of collective amnesia, which is the syndrome
I first discussed in Worlds in Collision, the amnesia that oc-
curs in a single victim closely following the trauma is not an
exact parallel: the collective mind does not immediately for-
get what it went through. What occupies us are the two
processes in which the heritage was transmitted: the con-
scious oral and later written relay, and the unconscious, ra-
cial mneme, inherited and occasionally activated after some
related experiences.
Psychoanalysis as it is practiced today ignores Freud’s
deeper insights. But, loath to read the testimony of the
witnesses of celestial and terrestrial order turned to chaos—a
terror chilling the very marrow of the bones—psychoanalysis
was prudent not to follow Freud and stopped a great step
earlier, not recognizing the importance of the role of biologi-
cal inheritance of acquired characteristics in mental spheres
on a collective basis. Yet, many new possibilities would open
up, and numerous of the observed expressions of neurosis
would be understood, with some knowledge of what hap-
pened to humanity in ages past.
THE ARCHAIC TRAUMA
Quite a few phenomena of both neuroses of fear and
neuroses of compulsion, though they may have been trig-
gered by early infantile experiences, have their roots in ar-
15 Freud, Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion (Amsterdam,
1939).
34 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
chaic situations. They are of the nature of reactions to life-
threatening circumstances. Individuals who are afraid of
closed spaces, or panicked by wide-open areas, or fear views
from heights, or flight in planes, may perchance be exhibit-
ing atavistic fears engendered in the catastrophic experi-
ences of ancestors. And as in structural biology in which a
derivation of six fingers may often be traced to the same de-
formity in a quite removed ancestor, and again to an earlier
occurrence in farther removed progenitors, so also a psychic
anomaly may possibly skip several generations, only to reap-
pear as if in random cases.
One of the most traumatic collective experiences of man-
kind took place when the closely approaching foreign body
caused the displacement of Earth’s strata, producing agoniz-
ing shrieks. The early Greek poet and cosmologist Hesiod
wrote of the inscrutable noise: “The huge earth groaned;
the earth resounded terribly, and the wide heaven above.”"®
The people’s agony was increased by the sensation of
hardly being attached to the ground; the presence of the
foreign body, and possibly some attending electrical effect,
produced a sensation of near-weightlessness. Could it not be
that the people who are afraid of rising from the ground in
airplanes are victims of reawakened atavistic memories?
People who are inordinately afraid of thunder, or afraid
even to wet their feet in the sea, and others with incon
gruent neuroses of fear may also have their anamnesis from
centuries or millennia before their birth. And, likewise,
among the neuroses of compulsion there must be many in-
stances traceable to racial traumas.
The reader should not draw the erroneous conclusion that
the human psyche is nothing but a carrier of impressions en-
16 Theogony, translated by H. Evelyn-White (Loeb Classical Library,
1914). 11. 820 ff., 852 ff.

gendered in catastrophic circumstances. Certainly such nat-
ural urges as satisfaction of thirst and hunger, sexual activ-
ity, parental—especially motherly—protection of offspring,
the need for self-expression or self-assertion and recognition,
social congregation, preoccupation with accumulation of
material goods, and other drives, are all inborn in man—and
hardly any of them is unknown in animal species, domesti-
cated or wild. All these instincts are present in human
beings, and without some of them life itself could not per-
sist. But upheavals in nature, with the unleashing of fren-
zied elements, shocked the minds of survivors and left there
an indelible, heritable impression.
