DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS
“ TO OPEN A DOOR
I pose the question: Would the reading of my books and the
absorbing of their contents alleviate the pressure caused by
racial memories existing in all of us? Proper psycho-
analytical procedure is violated by revealing all at once in-
stead of making the patient arrive at his insights gradually.
This is only one of the violations. But there is a great advan-
tage over the accepted procedure in that instead of working
on the assumption that the dominant traumatic experience
of the human race was in Oedipal and castration experi-
ences, the true traumas are laid bare.
Is it then true that the making known of events forgotten
but enshrined in the collective subconscious mind can only
arouse hostile attitudes? If this is the case then my work is
pregnant only with hatred and irritation that will surface,
leaving the repressed contents where they are. In their expo-
sure phobia, the repressed contents in us would lock the es-
cape window of the collective psyche from the inside.
There must be a potent disturbance agent in action at the
reawakening of repressed hereditary amnesia. It happens
also with individual psychoanalytic patients that an un-
timely disclosure causes a breakdown of a schizophrenic na-
ture: in the hands of unskilled analysts such results must not
162 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
be uncommon. In my psychoanalytic practice I have es-
tablished a preventive procedure and never failed to follow
it. I will digress here and briefly explain my approach.
The narcissistic tendencies must be treated first, and as
long as these tendencies prevail, the latent homosexual incli-
nations or the Oedipal ties should not be the subject of ana-
lytical work. It is by a sucéessive advance into these less
pathological regions in the psyche that the analysand has the
chance of liberating himself from autistic eroticism, the
stage at which the ego is nearest to a schizophrenic disturb-
ance. Should the analyst tackle the hidden homosexuality
first, he would, by bringing such component of the neurotic
personality into his conscious mind, make an escape from
autism no longer possible; and should the Oedipal complex
in autistic or homosexual patients be the first target of the
analytical work, the autistic as well as the homosexual tend-
encies would be cut off from the healing process. The sickest
part of the neurosis—the autistic libido—needs to be exposed
and treated first; then the homosexual component of the
personality would come more to the fore provided the Oedi-
pal tendencies are not made prematurely the analyst’s tar-
get; the emergence of the homosexual component in an
autistic patient would signal an advance in the analysis.
Lastly, the Oedipal component is the object of treatment—
and with the emergence of that tendency (almost para-
mount in all patients) into the conscious mind, the last stage
is reached in guiding the patient to normalcy. I found that
such procedure never fails—in a matter of months only,
hardly ever of years—to achieve successful completion of the
analysis. Too many analysts, unaware of the proper proce-
dure, drag the analysis on for years, and what is worse, occa-
sionally lose their patients to schizophrenia: the advance in
the proper direction is blocked, and the premature tackling
of lesser deviations sends the patient in the direction of
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 163
greater deviations by locking doors that need to be kept
open.
In the right procedure it is as if a door of a ward of greatly
disturbed patients is opened and the patient is given a
chance to move into a ward of less disturbed, and, again, by
the same stratagem, into a ward of the least perturbed, be-
fore leaving the hospital; whereas tackling the Oedipal com-
plex first in patients with emotional disturbance in the stages
of homosexual and autistic fixations is equivalent to locking
the door leading to the less-disturbed ward and leaving open
only the exit into the wards of the more and more disturbed.
Freud intuitively followed the correct procedure but no-
where formulated it in his writings; the art of analysis being
that of art and of science, nct all—by far not all—analysts
follow the rule; and then endless analyses or, what is worse,
devastating results, not without cases of suicide, are the
fruits.
These rules of cautious procedure I pursued, with gratify-
ing results, in my analytical work; but in having presented
my understanding of man’s past in the frame of a recon-
struction of the historical past of the planets, I lost control
over the effects, often greatly perturbing, on the psyche of
individuals exposed to that revelation.
BEDLAM’S BASEMENT
I have repeatedly heard and occasionally read that in the
hallucinogenic state produced by peyote and other such
drugs violent sensations of impending doom, of cosmic en-
counters, of ensuing pandemonium, overcome the novice or
the habitual user. The vividness of the experience and the
terror it evokes cause such physical phenomena as runaway
heartbeat, shivering and excessive sweating. By no means
does such a state always result from intake; it is claimed by
164

From

even

for
a
long
time
we were
not

was
occurring.
With

to

the

began
to
be-

have
appeared
clearly
in
some
twelve
or
more
sessions
involving
a
number
of different subjects,
and
what
is
felt
and describedforms
a
different
pattern
from anything
else
which we have
encountered.
“All such memories are loaded with terror. There is usu-
ally a continual violent shivering and shaking of the body,
sudden sensations of heat followed by intense chills, much
confusion and a sense of utter disorientation, sudden shock-
like reactions and convulsive spasms, as well as visual im-
ages of electrical discharges, high winds, torrential rains,
earthquakes and an indescribable pandemonium of noises.”
Having read the minutes of one of such sessions, complete
with every word uttered by the person, partly in response to
the prodding of the experimenter, and with the detailed de-
scription of the torture-like experience of a groaning and ut-
terly frightened subject of the experiment, I inquired: But
why does a person look for such an experience? To this I did
not receive a satisfactory answer from my correspondent. Is
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 165
it, then, a matter of the need to revisit the time and the
scene in which man and beast tried in a supreme effort and
with dwindling success to get away alive from a collapsing
stage, the dimensions of which were the whole Earth and
space besides?
A teacher in the public school system in the city of New
York wrote me a letter in which he told of his dreams, of his
hallucinogenic experiences, and sounded his alarm at man’s
inability or unwillingness to view his heritage. He expressed
his thoughts almost poetically—they looked on paper almost
as if they were written in ancient characters of biblical
Hebrew—yet they were written in modern English. He
wrote:
“You have begun for mankind the dredging up of a past
filled with unimaginable violences. Before the Armageddon
is recreated: for us by that substitute-comet idol, the
H-bomb missile, although the race is close we must do ev-
erything in our power to remember who we are, and why
we are violent. You have provided ethnic, historical, archeo-
logical, geological evidence for your theories on the holo-
caust-collisions, but you have not tapped the most important
source of truth—the memory of the catastrophes themselves
as experienced by our surviving ancestors and passed on to
their descendants through the dream and hallucination. I
have had hundreds of dreams—some involving the comet-
approaching terror, the flaming, feather-arrow-brilliance
across the sky, the wrenching fear, the attempts to build
shelters, the preservation of food and water, the hope-
lessness, the raining stones, the burning mutilated bodies,
the endless black waters, the steeples and debris on which
survivors cling, the burning cities, the oil droplets descend-
ing, the forced witnessing of charred bodies, the bits of
corpses hurtling through the air, the labyrinths which the
166 MANKIND IN AMNESIA

fled
into
beneath

(part
of the

the

that

You
are

because

The

are
one

of
ex-

without threatening

The
alternative of our not

and
re-create
from
our horror-filled
past
is
a
dismal
one:
using violence
to

violence
of
fusion
or
fission—or
perhaps
the
explosive
super-novae
chainreaction

a
frenzy
to

and
try
out.
Must we re-create the disasters and decimations, the plane-
tary turmoil—or shall we join forces and encourage the recall
of ourscommon origin—and our common loss—through the
re-creation of the historical truth from the material of the
dream as a record of actual events seen from a certain geo-
graphical and emotional perspective? Perhaps we will also
remember man as he was before the idea of sin and shame
made him leave the earthly eden that earth once was, and
which can be vaguely sensed by visionaries, and crudely ex-
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 167
perienced by the ingestion of hallucinogens? The terrors of
mankind are now emerging, but we shall find them harm-
less, for if we can face them, we not only find them awesome
but exhilarating—the consciousness of mind streaming back
into the bedlam basement of Hell brought on by the im-
mense conjunction and commingling of our planet with a
fiery dazzling plasmatic comet of immense richness and hor-
ror-beauty.”
If there is truth in what this schoolteacher wrote to me, it
is quite possible that the widespread use of hallucinogenic
drugs has as one of its springs the urge to live through the
traumatic experience, the memory of which is buried deep
in man’s mind.
PLANETS IN DREAMS AND ANXIETY
Regimen, a work the authorship of which is ascribed to
Hippocrates, the great Greek physician of the latter part of
the fifth century B.c. and the early part of the fourth, has a
chapter “On Dreams.” It contains the following observa-
tion:
“Whenever the heavenly bodies wander about, some in
one way and others in another, it indicates a disturbance of
the soul arising from anxiety.”
The translator of Regimen, W.H.S. Jones, supplied a vari-
ant for the rendering of the sentence “some in one way and
others in another,” namely, “now in one direction and now
in another.”
The movement, and especially irregular movement, of the
planets in dreams is connected with unconscious terror:
Hippocrates’ observation and interpretation are based on a
deep insight. But why should great anxiety find its expres-
sion in dreams, a product of the subconscious mind, by mak-
ing planets wander in the sky, if the celestial bodies have al-
168 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
ways moved on regular courses, never threatening our
planet and its inhabitants?
To illustrate Hippocrates’ description of a fearful dream,
with planetary bodies leaving their paths, I present here a
dream narrated to me by a professor of history at a Mid-
western university when, on the occasion of a lecture I gave
there a few years ago, a group of faculty members enter-
tained me with a meal and conversation:
“Some time ago you expressed interest in a dream of mine
that I recounted in the course of a dinner table conver-
sation. The dream took place, to the best of my recollection,
when I was six and a half or seven years old (i.e., late 1920
or in the course of 1921). . . . In the dream I was in the
yard of our house late at night; with great awe and fear I
watched the heavens where there was no moon but where
the heavenly bodies, larger than normal, swarmed ‘angrily
or contended with each other. The words I weigh very care-
fully to suggest the impression that was actually made.
“The dream made a particular impression on me because
the press at the time carried reports of prophecies of the “end
of the world.’ Later (a year or so) when I obtained a library
card I spent quite a bit of time reading into children’s books
on astronomy. At the end of my undergraduate work at Har-
vard I almost decided on a career in astronomy when I was
offered a fellowship on the basis of my work as an assistant
at the observatory there. I cite all this in partial explanation
of why the dream persisted in my mind. In the course of the
thirties the dream was forgotten. In the spring of 1944 I
recalled it in conjunction with my witnessing air raids on
London but also in conjunction with my reading of J. W.
Dunne’s Experiment with Time, which suggests that in sleep
the mind is released to travel through the fourth dimension.
(Dunne, a mathematician, had some vogue in England at
the time.) Naturally the thesis suggested that my childhood
dream was a pre-visit to wartime London. However, strictly
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 169
speaking, the dream was different from the night air-raid in
that in it the swarming heavenly bodies filled the sky and
were unrelated to activity on the surface of the Earth. There
was nothing like the searchlights, the rockets or anti-aircraft
fire.”
In the case described here, the dream and the anxiety and
curiosity it provoked directed the studies of the dreamer in
his college years and almost decided his choice of profes-
sion.
We saw in an earlier section that Jung developed the
theory of the collective unconscious mind. Beside one’s own
private subconscious, in every one of us lives racial memory:
we are carriers of some characters—Jung called them arche-
types—identical in all humanity. How these patterns came
into existence Jung did not know; he only believed he knew
that these archetypes are found again and again, as patterns
of thought and imagination, and he ascribed them to the
primeval emergence of man as homo sapiens. It did not
occur to him that common and terrifying experiences, in
which all participated and from which few survived, en-
graved themselves in man’s inheritable substance. After
Jung’s death quite a few of his disciples started to see the
answer in the events described in Worlds in Collision.
Shortly before his death, Jung described a dream that had
been reported to him:
... As the sphere very swiftly approached the Earth, I
thought at first that it was Jupiter that left its orbit, but as
the sphere came closer, I saw that despite its large size, it
was far too small for a planet like Jupiter. . . . As we real-
ized that it must come to a terrible collision with the Earth,
we felt well-understood terror; but it was a terror in which
awe dominated. It was a cosmic act that called for awe and
170 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
wondering. . . . A second sphere and a third one and more
approached with great velocity. Every one of them crashed
into the Earth... .1
Something out of racial memory revealed itself in this
dream. Even the first impression that the approaching celes-
tial body was the giant Jupiter, later corrected, represents
the great illusion that the forebears experienced at the ap-
proach of Venus, mistaken for Jupiter, as described in
Worlds in Collision (“Zeus and Athene”). The din of crash-
ings recalls the experience of the same time when “mighty
thunderings” (Exodus 9:28) accompanied the fall of the me-
teorites; these noises were no less terrifying than the de-
structions the meteorites caused.
The near-freeing of submerged and terrifying racial
mnemes would naturally produce an expectation of dooms-
day. In the above-quoted book, his last, Jung prefaced a dis-
cussion of flying saucers with these unusual words:
It is not arrogance that urges me, but my medical con-
science which advises me to fulfil my duty and to prepare
the few whom I can reach to the fact that events are in store
for the human race that signify the end of an Eon.
In these parting words, after over half a century of study
of the human mind, Jung revealed his vision of things to
come.
* TORNADO
In 1966 a violent tornado whirled through Topeka, Kan-
sas, and its surroundings and wrought devastation. In Octo-
ber 1973 a resident of that city of about 100,000 wrote me a
1C. G. Jung, Ein moderner Mythus (Ziirich: 1958).
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 171
letter on the psychological reactions to that experience by
the residents of the city and by himself. Tornadoes often en-
danger that city and warning signals are given, and though
he was absent when the tornado hit, it was the reactions of
the inhabitants he observed to the warning signals that
made the writer of the letter wonder. Over a year after first
writing me he wrote again on the irrational psychological re-
action, as it appeared to him, comparing it with his own ex-
cessive, but opposite, reaction to these signals. Since the cor-
respondent had been, as he described, through analytical
treatment, it was instructive to read even in his first letter
the realization that not infantile impressions and fears, nor
social surroundings and interactions, but some racial experi-
ence is the residue undissolved by the analysis of personal
experiences—the very realization at which Freud arrived
after many years of contemplation. The man from Topeka,
however, was not familiar with the Freudian concept of sub-
merged racial memories. This concept is regularly, even con-
sistently, left undiscussed and unattended by analysts in
their work, thus showing that they not only neglect what
Freud himself regarded as his crowning achievement but
are themselves purged only to a certain depth. The fault is
Freud’s insofar as he realized the “demoniac power” exer-
cised by the submerged racial memory of a traumatic expe-
rience of the past, but failed to realize the nature of that ex-
perience.
My correspondent recognized the aversion in men of
science to facing reality, and he did not spare barbs. Not
aware of Freud’s insights into the racial memory, he referred
to Freud as having only immersed his toes in waters of pro-
found depth and having withdrawn them as too hot. A bet-
ter acquaintance with Freud’s deeper insight, not com-
municated to him when he was on the analytical couch,
would have precluded this slighting remark. He had the ad-
Life? MANKIND IN AMNESIA
vantage over Freud in that he had read the pioneer work of
the apostate to whom he was writing. Thus he knew that the
traumatic experience of the human race was not in repeated
patricide in prehistoric caves, but in the horror of helpless
man, who since the beginning of time has more than once
been threatened with destruction by hostile elements—
elements from which he burrowed in the ground “as a mole”
or stampeded to sometimes fatal shelter in trembling moun-
tain caves.
Since the man from Topeka was away from the city dur-
ing the tornado of 1966, I inquired how close he came to
such an experience that he reacts the way he does to warn-
ing alerts. He describes, in reply, the panicky feeling he felt
when caught in traffic in Minneapolis, where he grew up,
even in advance of police siren warnings of a tornado. Min-
neapolis is a city only rarely afflicted by these rotating
storms, and others in the traffic responded quite differently
from the Topekans who had experienced the event of 1966.
In the face of a tornado warning only a few years after the
1966 experience, the latter acted as if trying to negate the
experience. A comparison with the reaction of the people of
Hiroshima comes to mind, always keeping in view the much
greater scale of the event and much greater toll in human
life. But the event of Hiroshima was, in its turn, not on the
scale of the global events of the human past.
From his letters I could learn that the writer studied law
and is a man of some prosaic occupation; neither his train-
ing nor his qualifications would make him an expert in the
matters about which he wrote. Yet the analysts of the Men-
ninger clinic near Topeka and with them the entire great
crowd of those who, one generation after Freud, sit at the
head of the couch and listen “with the third ear” should
consider whether there is possibly any lesson to learn from
these missives that I shall extensively quote.

“I live in Topeka, Kansas, a place notorious for its unpre-
dictable, violent weather. Prior to my psycho-analytic im-
passe, the weather bothered me when it got bad, but it
wasn't something I worried about during more pacific inter-
vals. Yet even then there was a sense of foreboding, of immi-
nent evil, when the sky darkened. My analysis kept bump-
ing me against this nameless subconscious dread. I
developed a great fear of darkness, as if it would definitely
bring the greatest of catastrophes. My instincts when out-
side are to cover my head, and run for cover. The sky has
become the enemy. Now taking cover should provide con-
siderable relief from extant storm conditions—with me it
doesn’t. It’s as though these inimical forces threatening me
are far too powerful to be defended against. My feelings of
helplessness are total and it is this aspect that is the most in-
tolerable. The only relief possible is rage directed against
anyone, anything, blamable for any reason, no matter how
unconnected to the source of the threat... .
“T’ve watched closely the reactions, attitudes, of others in
this climate to the approach of bad weather. Seven years
ago a tornado did devastate this town, and since then there
have been numerous alerts. So, the people pretty much
know the odds, the effects, the behavior of such storms.
They know, as do I, that witn radar and warning sirens, un-
174 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
less you are alone and crippled, safety is assured. Yet when
these taut times do occur, almost nobody acts in relation to
experience or known probabilities!
“There is either near-panic (as with me), or, far more fre-
quently, refusal to take the warning seriously. This second
response, by people who’ve been in a tornado, is the amaz-
ing one. I must ask why would people who have survived
and know exactly what to do to survive again, not react?
“I answer this, as in my own case: this horrible external
event makes a connection with one much more horrible,
that in its inescapability actually did render men defense-
Vesey: se -
Fifteen months later, as the second letter shows, the
thoughts expressed in the first letter had not retreated to the
back of the mind of the writer, and not only continued to
occupy him but also led to some new realizations:
“Dear Dr. Velikovsky,
“For a number of years now, I’ve been thinking about
what I consider to be man’s greatest natural enemy. No, not
death—worse. I refer to man’s tendency to view the world
and himself only as it most pleases him... .
“Dr. Velikovsky, you are hated, dreaded, because you
bring up something basically intolerable. You shatter the
control belief. You present a cause for certain human behav-
iors and feelings, that is inhuman in origin, uncaring, and
worst—vastly uncontrollable. Inhuman forces, perhaps blind,
perhaps tinged with malevolence, surround us. And it is this
state of affairs, more than any other, that is unacceptable to
the human mind... .
“I wrote you a year ago about some observations I’d
made concerning tornadoes. These natural events, to me, are
things that make a connection with repressed memories of a
catastrophic nature.
DREAMS AND HALLUCINATIONS 175
“I live in Topeka, Kansas, in an area, in spring and fall,
under an almost constant threat of tornadoes. In 1966 a tor-
nado struck here. It was half a mile wide, and though I
wasn't here at the time, the films taken of it were the most
horrifying thing I’ve ever seen... .
“My interest in this subject was spurred by the observa-
tion that just a few years after the disaster, people acted as
though it hadn’t happened. Even now, when warning sirens
are screaming, most people do nothing. They refuse to alter
their behavior at all. Nor is the attitude one of hopelessness
in the face of an awesome enemy. In fact, there is much one
can do to protect himself. Listen to the radio, head for a
basement, pay some attention. Yet, many don’t even do
those simple things. They act as though nothing was hap-
pening—almost as though nothing ever had happened.
“And incredibly enough, this bizarre response is typical of
people who lived through the great tornado of 1966, people
who saw, heard, its devastation.
_“T must say that there are a few who feel the terror, who
tremble and can acknowledge the peril. These, however,
often act as though there is no escape, even though the
basement is seconds away.
“At any rate, all this seemed most peculiar to me. Espe-
cially since I’ve known people who have been in severe auto
wrecks. The response of these people is dramatically
different from the tornado behavior. The wreck victims don't
see driving as hopelessly dangerous and give up the prac-
tice. Nor do they ignore the episode, driving as though noth-
ing had happened. They do continue driving—but more
carefully. They act rationally.
“Why, then, the strange behavior under the tornado
threat?
“People around here tend not to use the word ‘tornado,
preferring the word ‘storm.’ Quite a difference in the emo-
tive power of the two words. Even more peculiar is the fact
>
176 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
that animals seem to know when a tornado is likely. The in-
sects disappear, birds stop singing, dogs tremble and head
for cover. This does not happen in a mere thunderstorm
without tornadic potential. Even I can feel it—the very air
holds its breath, waiting, hoping, wishing.
“Everyone feels it, while most completely disregard the
information. It’s not simply that they have no control—
because they can get out of the way, they can take cover.
They don’t. And to me, it is rather like walking down a rail-
road track, seeing and hearing the oncoming train, and not
stepping aside.
“But a train seems to be different from a natural menace.
People do step off the tracks.
“The event is too enormous as it rolls out of the South-
west. Blackish gray, it comes, stretching from horizon to ho-
rizon, moving like a gigantic wave. Day becomes night, and
you feel—like it’s the end of the world.
“It’s an outright apocalyptic experience.
“And for that reason, no amount of learning about these
storms, no amount of emergency practice, can lessen the hor-
ror associated with them. Denial seems the only defense. It
is an anesthetic that serves people as emotional protection
from the terror.”
Less than a fortnight after the date of the just-quoted let-
ter, and in response to my inquiry, the man from Topeka de-
scribed his earlier experience in Minneapolis: there the resi-
dents had no great calamity in their memory, yet in
response to a siren, disrupted all traffic. Having reached
home he looked up:
“Very high, and a good distance off, I saw what looked to
be a thin, grayish-white wisp hanging from the clouds. Its
bottom end, still considerably above ground, was moving,
almost like a cat’s slow twitching tail.
“Though it was going away from where I was, I went into

the basement feeling there was no escape. My reaction was
so severe, I feared for my heart. Nothing came our way, but
as it turned out, a dozen lives were lost elsewhere in the
city.
“The interesting thing about it, was the less than con-
scious feelings I'd had preceding the sighting. My body
knew, even before the sirens, that an agony was approach-
ing. It was a sensation I'd never had in any previous storm.
It was the feeling of death—not just mine, but everybody’s.
Again, it seemed, imperatively, like the end of everything.
“I remember something else. When I was a small boy, I
was particularly impressed and confused by my father’s be-
havior during storms. By nature he was a very rational, care-
ful person, who never ceased reminding me to be careful
about cars, falls, knives, electricity, yet when a storm came
up, he would drop whatever he was doing and go outside.
Even in severe electrical storms, he’d wander out in the
open.
“He showed no fear at all, and was oblivious to all else.
And the look in his eyes was very strange. Kind of bright, a
glaze, not at all characteristic of the very focused, alert, and
prudent man that he otherwise was. It scared me. It was as
if he were being drawn, with no conscious participation, into
a union with the violence.
“T’ve seen much that same thing here in Topeka. People
who lived through the tornado of 1966 suddenly find things
they have to do outside during the sirens. Mowing lawns,
going to the store—that sort of thing. Never in a hurry, but
slow, languid, detached.
“There was a study done of the survivors of that disaster.
Afterwards, no one mentioned what had happened, nothing
was said of the destruction, even as they were being pulled
from the rubble. Nor did the victims say much about the ex-
perience, other than to describe the external activity going
on around them as the tornado struck. No subjective ac-

counts, no impressions of how it really was for them, appear.
You get the feeling that nothing was really experienced—
consciously. Immediately afterward, there was little sign of
emotion of any kind. Few describe anything but the state of
being dazed.
“One couple I know, who lived only one block from the
total devastation, emerged a8 soon as the thing roared past,
got in their car and drove across town to keep a bridge-play-
ing date. This, despite the fact that it took them two hours
to negotiate the mile of debris that lay between them and
the party. Business as usual, nothing at all had happened.
“Just last spring, with the skies pregnant with malice, si-
rens screaming, radio reporting a tornado over the city, my
neighbor is sitting on his front lawn, his two-year-old son in
his lap. He, too, had been in Topeka in 1966. Lightning had
just knocked the power off, and split a tree in half across the
street. Yet, there he was.
“T don’t know if you'll find these vignettes helpful. Hope-
fully, they convey the frightening incomprehension that is
the rule during such times. Perhaps my unconscious is closer
to the surface than most people’s. They act in accordance
with no existing reality.”
