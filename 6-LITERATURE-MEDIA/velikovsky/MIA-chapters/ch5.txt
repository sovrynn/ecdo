THE AGE OF TERROR
“WHY WAR?”
After World War I and only a single year before Hitler took
over the German Reich, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud
exchanged letters on the theme: “Why War?” Two great
men of the generation, whose ideas colored the thinking of
the first half of this century and continue to do so, engaged
in an inquiry, Einstein, the physicist and pacifist, asking
Freud, twenty-three years his senior, whether the field of
psychiatry and psychoanalysis knows a panacea against the
slaughter of human beings organized in states, against a
sanctioned destruction of human life.
“It would be of the greatest service to us all were you to
present the problem of world peace in the light of your re-
cent discoveries, for such a presentation might blaze the
trail for new and fruitful modes of action.”
Freud in his reply gave a melancholy prognosis. He visu-
alized “no likelihood of our being able to suppress human-
ity’s aggressive tendencies.” The rest of Freud’s reply was
nothing but an elaboration on this verdict.

Affairs” thirty-five years later, years that saw World War II

was no effort made on the part of psychiatrists. “In 1935,
339 psychiatrists from thirty nations signed a manifesto on
war prevention” in which the signatories stated: “We psy-
chiatrists declare that our science is sufficiently advanced
for us to distinguish between real, pretended, and uncon-
scious motives, even in statesmen.””
Two years later, in the summer of 1937, a large congress
of psychologists convened in Paris.? Professor Claparéde of
Geneva read the main address, “Hatred among the Na-
tions,” which contained pious hopes and expressions of faith
in human progress. The paper I read was the only other dis-
cussion of the same theme.* My view, derived at that time
from psychoanalytical thinking, saw in repressed homosex-
uality of entire nations the source of hatred and of lust for
doing bodily harm on a mass scale, of the massacres and the
triumphs of a race motivated by male homosexuality,
against and over an effeminate nation. Is not the lust of the
Turks carrying massacre to an Armenian village enhanced
by these diversities in subconscious national make-up? Is
not Germany, with its national emblem of an eagle with

talons spread for piercing the victim’s flesh, a natural enemy
of France, with its maiden in a Phrygian cap, and, alterna-
tively, a chanticleer, a noisy but little frightening, almost
amusing, substitute for a male?
I still believe that suppressed homosexuality has much to
do with aggression. In the series of conflicts between Israel
and the Arab states the latter were thoroughly and repeat-
edly trounced by the Jews whose image through centuries of
dispersion was that of a persecuted and violated nation.
Thus the long-cherished self-esteem of Arabs as a male race
suffered so greatly that no concessions on the part of Israel
would pacify them.
Of my projected book The Masks of Homosexuality, my
paper entitled “Tolstoy’s Kreutzer Sonata and Unconscious
Homosexuality” was published in Freud’s magazine Imago;*
the rest was left fallow through my having become cap-
tivated by the recognition that grew into the themes of
Worlds in Collision, Ages in Chaos and Earth in Upheaval.
_ World War II of course did not hold off, waiting for psy-
chologists to find and expose the roots of the scourge known
as war. “The idea that ‘wars begin in the minds of men’ and
that ‘it is in the minds of men that defenses of peace must be
constructed’ is as old as the history of relations between or-
ganized societies.”
Dr. Wedge continued to quote from the Einstein-Freud
exchange of 1932; and observing the futility of the efforts,
he asked: “Why has the scientific profession most concerned
with helping the individual with the troubles of his mind
failed to contribute to solving the most significant problem
in all human behavior? What could psychiatry contribute?”
Wedge assessed the impotence of psychiatric science to
cope with the problem, but himself came up with nothing

more promising than “studies of the personality charac-
teristics of foreign leaders, of psychopolitical factors in
specific international conflicts, of interpretation of negotiat-
ing behavior and of improving effectiveness of com-
munication among nations,” etc. These are hardly more than
generalities in some instances and palliatives in others. But
before he submitted these, he made a true observation:
“Psychiatry is primarily concerned with individual human
beings. Only recently has the revolutionary concept of social
interdependence led psychiatry to broader concerns, those
of the community and the nation as these bear on the his-
tory of individuals. The orthodox limits of psychiatry do lit-
tle to prepare the profession for the scientific consideration
of international affairs.
“Psychiatrists who become concerned with the interna-
tional world quite correctly perceive that dynamic psycho-
logical factors are somehow operative in it. Here, however,
the scale of the problem is baffling. . . .”:
THE RECURRENT SCOURGE
There exists a seventeen-year locust. What makes the in-
sect swarm after this long period is not known; no terrestrial
or extraterrestrial cause is obvious.
There is a similar phenomenon in the human race. Should
we investigate the great wars of the last few centuries we
would observe a certain periodical regularity in the return
of these.great paroxysms. (I leave it to others to determine
whether such patterns can be found also in periods prior to
the last few centuries. )

Tue AGE oF TERROR 143
heart of the country, near Poltava, far from his own land, he
suffered defeat at the hands of Peter the Great.
At the same time Charles XII warred in eastern Europe,
western Europe was the scene of a war (1701-14) in which
France under Louis XIV, Spain and Bavaria were engaged
against England, Holland, Austria, several German states
and Portugal, with Savoy repeatedly changing sides. This
“War of the Spanish Succession” was carried on along the
Rhine and the Danube, in Flanders, Italy and Spain and on
the seas; it resulted, among other things, in France’s ceding
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to England, in Spain’s ced-
ing Gibraltar and Minorca and Portugal’s asserting itself in
Brazil. :
A little more than a century later, actually 104 years after
the outbreak of these hostilities, Napoleon made his on-
slaught on the combined forces of Prussia, Austria and Rus-
sia at Austerlitz (1805). He subdued most of Europe and
fought deep into Russia in 1812, where he was defeated. He
lost again at the Battle of the Nations (1813), and he fought
a final battle at Waterloo (1815).
Again, a little over one hundred years later, the world was
once more in flames. Germany under Wilhelm II led Aus-
tria-Hungary and Turkey against England, France and
Russia. World War I engulfed many nations in Europe and
in faraway parts of the world on an unprecedented scale. It
continued from 1914 to 1918. There is an unmistakable pat-
tern in this recurrence of events repeated after approxi-
mately 104 years.
But also halfway between these wars were wars of conti-
nental dimensions, so that the real pattern has fifty-two
years from the beginning of one great explosion to the be-
ginning of the next. In the eighteenth century it was the
Seven Years’ War (1756-63), the worldwide struggle of Aus-
tria, Russia, France and their allies against Prussia and Eng-
land that gave England the decisive advantage over France
144 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
in North America and India and the West Indies, and made
Prussia the great opponent of Austria.
In the nineteenth century it was the Civil War (1861-65)
in America during which hundreds of thousands of people
were killed in one of the greatest slaughters in military his-
tory.
The last great paroxysm erupted at the half point of the
regular fifty-two-year period: whereas World War I started
in August 1914, World War II started in September 1939
but came to full expansion in 1940; it continued for six
years, enveloping again the five continents. In the past the
curve had a great rising wave every fifty-two years; in this
century the great wave rose also at the half point of the pe-
riod, or advanced by half a period.
A scrutiny of a graph of the major armed conflicts would
reveal a short rise before and after each peak, these foothills
denoting conflicts of minor magnitude or of confined charac-
ter. Thus the Civil War was preceded by the Crimean War
and followed by the Prussian exploits against Austria, Den-
mark and France. The First World War was preceded by
the Balkan wars and followed by the civil war in Russia.
World War II was preceded by the exploits of Mussolini
against Ethiopia (as well as by the Spanish civil war and the
war between Japan and China) and followed by the Korean
War.
Following this pattern, a new great explosion of hostilities
among nations was due in about 1966; the world entered
into a gtate of tension and arms race and also of localized
wars, in Vietnam and the Middle East. The atomic weapons
developed since the end of World War II acted as a deter-
rent.*
* If there is sufficient flexibility in such cycles that a major explosion can
be advanced by half a cycle (as with World War II) or that a major explo-
sion that seems due can be deterred (as with 1966), then perhaps we should
Tue AGE oF TERROR 145
If there is in the human race an urge for destruction and
self-annihilation that comes to the fore at intervals of fifty-
two and possibly also of twenty-six years (the span from the
midpoint of World War I to the midpoint of World War II),
then instead of political and economic factors, psychological
or even biological factors must be thought of as fuses ignit-
ing outbursts in human masses. A state of irritability is a
precondition for the “patriotic” intransigence that leads to
great uncontrollable conflicts with trespass and maiming
and killing. With the human race merging into great com-
munities divided into camps, the local, “tribal” periods of
conflict are themselves being merged into the sudden com-
mon explosions on a continental and, now in this century, a
global scale.
The repetition of great conflicts, spaced at fifty-two-year
periods and threatening also at half periods, must be consid-
ered as another natural phenomenon, like the swarming of
locusts at seventeen-year periods (it could be noted in pass-
ing that the latter is about a third part of fifty-two, though
the periods may have no relation to one another). The phe-
nomenon of mass hysteria on a global scale must be under-
stood and its roots must be searched and extracted.
The fact that two enormous natural cataclysms took place
thirty-four centuries ago at this very interval of fifty-two
years must be recalled, and if not affirmed as the biologi-
cally engendering cause of such periodical mass hysterias,
then still suspected and investigated. The very suspicion
and inquiry may themselves have healing effects.
also be cautious in our extrapolations regarding the seven-hundred-year cycle.
In the section “A Periodicity of Frenzy,” we spoke of the twenty-first century.
But the cycle in question is of only approximately seven hundred years. It
would be a mistake to assume that we will be safe until the middle of the
twenty-first century. All we can say is that the hour seems late.
146 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
THE CHOSEN PEOPLE
OF HIROSHIMA
On August 6, 1945, a U.S. military chaplain blessed the
crew of a plane and wished them a successful accom-
plishment of their mission—to carry and drop an atomic
bomb over Hiroshima.
There was a blinding flash, a hot blizzard and earthquake,
a mushroom welling into the sky; bodies charred, tens of
thousands of them—and the dawn of the atomic age.
A score of years later (1967) Robert Jay Lifton, professor
of research in psychiatry at Yale University, published a
very powerful book, Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima.
He interviewed seventy people from among the survivors, of
all walks of life. He found little essential difference in the
mental make-up among the educated and uneducated, the
physicists, writers, preachers and shopkeepers, housewives,
peasants and the wayward and the outcast. I quote, below,
Paul Goodman’s impression of Lifton’s book because of the
insight at which Goodman arrived:®
“They insist—it is seventeen years later—on the abiding
presentness of the event. They refuse to betray the sacred lit-
eralness of its detail. The event was Great, some could even
speak of a ‘quicker happiness’ in the sense of awakening
from the illusions of this world. They are Chosen People.
Many have stigmata like marks of the Lord Jesus. They
form a mystical fellowship with a mission. They are a sac-
rifice. They are to be liberators of the out-caste and apos-
tles of peace. They are despised but they are the stone that
the builders rejected.
6 Paul Goodman, “Stoicism and the Holocaust,” The New York Review of
Books, March 28, 1968, p. 15. Cf. exchange of letters between Lifton and
Goodman in ibid., April 28, 1968, pp. 36-37.
THE AGE oF TERROR 147
“One must be morally perfect and not sell the experience
to money-changers. Indeed, according to some, any speech
and self-initiated or socially-initiated effort are a profana-
tion. One must safeguard purity by refined taboos, e.g., not
to wear nylon stockings for they are made by DuPont. Yet
since there has been a reversal of values, it is incumbent on
people to ‘despoil the Egyptians,’ e.g., to operate on the
black market. The matrix of human existence has broken
down; there has been a wound in the order of being: one
cannot live unless there are a new heaven and new earth. ‘T
saw actual hell in this world.’ Traditional religion, Buddhist
or Catholic, cannot cope with the new fact. The new dispen-
sation belongs to all mankind.
“But some day the lion will lie down with the lamb. “They
dream . . . that the energy of ten million horsepower per
gram be delivered out of the atom into the hands of the peo-
ple. That the rich harvest of science be conveyed, in peace,
to the people like bunches of succulent grapes wet with dew
gathered in at dawn.’ This Isaiah-like vision is by Sanchiki
Toge. A rainbow will shine after the black rain. Even before
the Bomb, in the ordinary past, we were not living—it was a
delusion; but a man keeps seeing an indelible still photo-
graph of his innocent childhood: it is fixed—until the new
world in which to come alive.
“The elect saints, in communion with the dead who are
also present because they took part in the real event, are
meantime purgatorially trapped in the meaningless interim
of current history. Presumably they are awaiting a new
prophet who will make possible a transfigured life... .
While waiting, some sit silent and remember the wrathful
theophany; others speak with the dead.”
What
fixed
my
attention on
Paul
Goodman’s
essay
was
his
insight
in
comparing
the
experience
of the persistent
reac-
tion
of the survivors of
Hiroshima
with
the
experience andthe
subsequent
attitude of the
Israelites of the
days
of the
148 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
Exodus, an event long passed into history; he actually starts
his piece by referring to Martin Buber’s book on Moses:
“,. the Bible story cannot be taken literally yet is not
unhistorical: something happened that was, to those people,
super-natural or crazy, and the account we have received
was their attempt to cope with the experience, to regain
their wits, to reconstitute themselves in the world that had
been transformed.”
This parallel was not drawn by Professor Lifton; he, how-
ever, drew parallels with the mental evolution or, rather,
mutation in the survivors of the Nazi camps. A major por-
tion of Death in Life deals with “defense-mechanisms
against trauma: repression, denial, reaction formation, blot-
ting out . . . screen memory, scapegoating and alibi-ing,
self-hatred in order to avoid the anxiety of abandonment,
identification with the power that has harmed one in order
to avoid the anxiety of impotence, turning of anger against
the self and becoming guilty.”
The book re-creates “a remarkably total traumatized envi-
ronment,” but the reviewer is critical of the pathological
prognosis of Professor Lifton. To me, however, the mental
structure—because it is not merely an attitude, but a perma-
nent posture—of the hibakusha (by which name are known
the survivors of the holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
is a revealing and meaningful phenomenon in the light of
events long past, in this confrontation of “a fragment of san-
ity in a bland storm of madness” with “the people of the
world against the Powers of the World.”
Lifton writes: “The survivor's major defense against
death anxiety and death guilt is the cessation of feeling. In
our observations on Hiroshima we spoke of this process, in
its acute form, as psychic closing-off, and in its more chronic
form as psychic numbing. I would suggest now that psychic
numbing comes to characterize the entire life style of the
Tue Ace or Terror 149
survivor.”’ The “psychic numbing” among the survivors of
the catastrophe is, in my view, the first stage toward a sub-
mersion of large parts of the perceived events into a partial
oblivion. The basic dissimilitude of the two events—the phe-
nomena of the days of the Exodus and those of 1945—is in
the fact that the former were not of man’s making and they
were global; the events of our time were man-made, and
while they were also global in the sense that the war spread
to all the continents and seas, they were epitomized by the
burning of two cities in the release of “energy of ten million
horsepower per gram.” For the people of these cities the ca-
tastrophe was nothing less than global and only later did
the survivors learn that they were selected from all other
cities for that experiment in overkill. But before they
learned this, it was for them no different than if all cities the
world over had tumbled. The experiences of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki frightfully mirrored the moments when “in the
morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyp-
tians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud” (Exodus
14:24).
OF THE ROOTS OF ANTI-SEMITISM
In Ages in Chaos 1 have exposed the untruth of Manetho’s
identification of the Israelites with the Hyksos. Manetho
was an Egyptian historian of the third pre-Christian century
writing in Greek. The hatred that until then was directed
against the almost legendary Hyksos, the early conquerors
and exploiters of Egypt, was from then on directed against
the Jewish people. I showed also that the Hyksos, known to
the Egyptians as Amu, were the same as the Amalekites of
the Bible who dominated the Near East, as well as Palestine,

The Jewish people harbored a deep hatred of the Ama-
lekites from the days of wandering in the desert, where
the former, tired and thirsty, were mercilessly pillaged by
the Amalekites, through the days of the domination by the
Amalekites and Medianites who would regularly invade the
country with their numerous cattle before the harvest. This
hatred was kept alive not only through all the centuries of
Israel’s and Judah’s life in their own land, but also through
the long period of their diaspora, or world exile, down to our
days.
The Jewish historian of the first century of the present
era, Josephus Flavius, accepted Manetho’s identification of
the Israelites with the Hyksos, and by that time the anti-
Semitism of which Manetho three centuries earlier was the
first known literary source had already spread in the ancient
East. To rectify this wrong I have in Ages in Chaos followed
the correct identification by a short discourse on the begin-
ning of anti-Semitism.
There may be another aspect besides this ancient mis-
identification.
Since antiquity the Jewish people have claimed that the
great catastrophe of tribulations, destructions and parox-
ysms of nature, as exemplified by plagues, the parting of the
Tue AcE or TERROR 151
sea and the vanishing of the pharaoh with his host, was
caused for the benefit of the sons of Israel. Egypt was
punished because of harshness toward them; the Israelites
were spared during the visitations of the plagues; their
leader called upon Egypt the plagues and upon its armies
the waters of the Sea of Passage; the Israelites were the
beneficiaries of the cataclysmic events. It is of lesser im-
portance, or of no importance, that historically they were
not spared by the raging elements as the biblical story
claims they were, and midrashic sources to the opposite
effect were cited in Ages in Chaos: at the plague of darkness
only two out of every hundred Israelites survived, and at the
Sea of Passage many of the escapees were engulfed by surg-
ing waters. The story as described in the Bible and as
believed by the Jews and by other peoples of antiquity and
of modern times is and was important: when Egypt
suffered, the Israelites. were exempt from the tribulations,
and they gained their freedom from the slavery of many
generations.
- The natural catastrophe that visited Egypt visited the en-
tire terrestrial globe, and many places on it went to com-
plete perdition. The experiences of those days persevered in
the collective unconscious mind of the human race.
These conceptions—whereby the Israelites were thought
to have been the only ones spared from the catastrophe of
the days of the Exodus, and Manetho’s misidentification of
the Israelites with the Hyksos—are at the root of anti-
Semitism, which persisted through the centuries.
THE SLAVE TRADERS AND THE SLAVES

Black continent, and the northern fringe, north of Sahara,
occupied by the Berber or Arab states. The east coast of

it
was, especially
in

the
continent
of
Africa
that
served
as
the
hunting

for slaves.
From
the
beginning
of the sixteenth
century
the
importation
of
slaves
into
the
Western

was
uninterrupted
until
only
a

ago:
though

trade
went
on

and continued

countries. In 1873,
only
a

over four
generations
ago,
of
the
1,500,000
pop-ulation of
Cuba,
500,000,
or
a
third,
were
slaves.
Under the heading “Mohammedan Slavery,” the four-
teenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica narrates (and
though encyclopedias are not sources I like to quote, I make
an exception in this case):
The central Sudan appeared to be one vast hunting
ground. Captives were brought thence to the slave market
of Kuka in Bornu, where, after being bought by dealers,
they were, to the number of about 10,000 annually, marched
across the Sahara to Murzuk in Fezzan, from which place
they were distributed to the northern and eastern Mediter-
ranean coasts. Their sufferings on the route were dreadful;
many succumbed and were abandoned. [It is reported that]
“any ‘one who did not know the way” by which the caravan
passed “would only have to follow the bones which lie right
and left of the track.” Negroes were also brought to Mo-
rocco from the western Sudan and from Timbuktu. “The
center of the traffic in Morocco was Sidi Hamed ibn Musa,
seven days’ journey south of Mogador, where a great yearly
fair was held. The slaves were forwarded thence in groups
Tue AGE oF TERROR 153
to different towns, especially to Marrakesh, Fez and Mequr-
nez.
The sultan levied an ad valorem duty on the slave trade.
From Morocco, French, Portuguese, British and other ships
carried the purchased slaves to their destinations.
The Zanzibar Arabs on the eastern coast of Africa were
the greatest traders of all. Black villages would be put to the
torch when their populations were asleep—sometimes with
the connivance of the village chiefs—and the fleeing blacks
would be captured, thus becoming human merchandise.
Many of those transported in chains on Arab ships, often not
seaworthy, died of maltreatment, thirst, and exposure to the
sun, and of some cargoes crossing the Atlantic not more
than fifty out of a hundred survived the passage.
The British, the French, the Portuguese and others buy-
ing the slaves in African markets moved them to Europe—
but mainly to the Americas. The British statistics had it that
exclusive of the slaves who died before they sailed from
Africa, 12% percent were lost during their passage to the
West Indies; at Jamaica 4% percent died while in the har-
bors or before the sale, and one third more in the “sea-
soning.”
The Zanzibar traders could not claim an equally “favora-
ble” survival of the human cargo.
The slave trade to the Western Hemisphere continued
after the Civil War, but, diminishing, it looked for other out-
lets; with further decline after the 1870s, the chief absorbing
market became the Arab countries themselves and especially
the Arabian Peninsula, the delivery area being the north-
eastern and eastern coasts of the African continent. There
was also an inner trade with the black kingdoms of Uganda,
Benin, and Dahomey, the Arab traders being here, too, the
suppliers; many of the slaves were also sacrificed in pagan
ceremonies. The nineteenth-century explorers, Dr. David
154 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
Livingston, Sir Samuel Baker and Dr. Heinrich Barth de-
scribed these practices.
Black slaves were until quite recently bought and sold in
Arabian markets, especially on the Arabian Peninsula. With
the spread of the Mohammedan religion among the blacks
of the eastern coast of Africa, the traders posed as mis-
sionaries, inviting the faithful to embark on pilgrimages to
Mecca. On arrival they were sold, never to return to Africa
to tell the true story of their travels. In the littoral kingdoms,
in the emirates and sultanates of the Arabian Peninsula,
slavery was sanctified by tradition and protected by law, in
violation of declarations of principles made by the European
powers at various times, notably in the latter part of the last
century. These notwithstanding, several member countries
of the United Nations still practice slavery at home.
A characteristic social and psychological phenomenon is
taking place in the process of the black reawakening in the
United States. The fourth- to tenth-generation descendants
of slaves (in the case of the West Indies only the third gen-
eration ) feel a resurgence of the longing for Africa that ac-
companied the fettered slaves on their forced voyage to this
country and haunted the thoughts of the first generation of
those working on plantations or in mines. But together with
this back-to-Africa sentiment, a strange, even pathological
phenomenon takes place: the most militant among the
American blacks look to the Arabs as their allies and men-
tors.

THe AGE OF TERROR 155
EXPLOSION OF POPULATION
The
explosion
of the
world population
is
proclaimed
by
many
as
the greatest
danger
to
the
future
of
the
human
race,
a
peril
not of
a
distant future
but
of the next
two
gen-
erations.
[
remember when
the
population
was
1.6
billion
human
beings;
now
it
exceeds
four
billion,
two

notwithstanding.
Calculations
are
being
made
as
to
what
the
human
population
of the
world
will
be
on the
basis
of
the
present
increase:
something
like
seven
or
ten
billion
at
the
end
of
the century.
Not
in
the
bomb
explosion but
in
the
population
explosion
lies
the greatest
danger,
proclaim
many
sociologists
and
almost
all
population-growth
experts.
The
populations
that
already verge
on starvation
multiply
the
fastest.
The
teeming.
people
on
the shores of the
Ganges
live
at
the
lowest standards:
homeless, they
defecate
in
pub-
lic
squares,
in
the open;
they
sleep
on
the
streets
of Cal-cutta;
and they procreate--cohabitation
is
one
of the
few
pleasures
left
to
the
penniless
and
unskilled.

In Egypt, the population of fellahin (farmers) in the
Delta, one of the most densely settled areas in the world,
suffers from malaria, from trachoma (an infectious eye dis-
ease that leads to blindness) and from bilharzia (a hook-
worm which bleeds the kidneys ). With the major part of the
inhabitants of these places thus suffering from one or more
of these debilitating diseases, the population increase, for
the entire Egypt of thirty million, is still over two million an-
nually—the major share belonging to the Delta.
The planet—our common home—is not growing; its food
reserves are limited and already insufficient to feed all the
156 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
people
of the globe,
and
the cry
is
heard
again—as
it
was
a
century
and
a
half ago,
when
Malthus
first
wrote—that
the
growth
of
a
population
outstrips
the
growth
of
means
of
subsistence.
And
as
for
food, the
ocean
does
not
yet
de-
liver
its
full
potential
share:
what
is
presently
being
taken
out
of the
ocean
is
only
a
fraction
of
what
is
available.
In
any
case
lodging,
education,
transportation—all
these
also
present
problems
increasingly
difficult
to
solve
should
the
lowly
of the earth
be
lifted
from
the
dust
and
mud
and
require
such
facilities.
There are those who proclaim the doctrine of the sacred-
ness of human life in all circumstances. The most callous
murderers are fed at public expense for life or for the dura-
tion of sentence as the case may be, the death penalty having
been abrogated in many states. Abortion, even of a child
conceived in rape, was until recently a punishable offense in
many places—and it has already happened that the rapist
and his victim both serve terms in the same penitentiary,
only the rapist, being guilty of a smaller offense, soon goes
on parole; but the victim stays behind bars for the murder of
the unborn child.
No program of relief from the dangers of population ex-
plosion is offered here. But possibly the significance of the
rapid increase in the world’s population lies elsewhere than
in concern over food. Let us consider the phenomenon as to
its possible sociobiological significance.
In the animal kingdom those forms of life that are in dan-
ger of annihilation usually produce the largest number of
progeny. Insects that have to endure the inclement winter
multiply enormously so that at least some of the progeny
will survive and perpetuate the species.
With this process observable in many animal forms on
land and in the sea, the great explosion of population in the
years following World War II requires close attention. It is
quite possible that there exists a regulating mechanism. It
THe AGE oF TERROR 157
has
been
observed
since
ancient
times
that
during
and
fol-
lowing
great wars, the
birth
of
males
is
definitely
greater
than
the
birth
of
females—nature
acting
as
a
regulator.
And
if
nature
can—by
means
unknown
to
man—switch
the
birth
rate in
favor
of
males,
cannot
the
same
nature regulate
the
very increase
of
population
to
protect
the
race
from
impend-
ing
extinction?
If it is so, then the seemingly uncontrolled increase of
population is a symptom in an incubating stage of a danger-
ous illness.
ARMAGEDDON ON THE DRAWING BOARDS
The editorial elucidation in the New York Times (Decem-
ber 18, 1974) of the Vladivostok agreement between the
leader of the Communist party in the Soviet Union and the
President of the United States reads:
The new accord would permit each side to build a “first-
strike” force of new MIRV multiple-warhead missiles, a
minor portion of which could threaten to destroy the bulk of
the other’s silo-based ICBM’s, while the bulk of the at-
tacker’s force remained in reserve to deter retaliation. Nei-
ther side has such a capability now... .
The Vladivostok agreement would permit the Soviet
Union, starting next year, to replace with new, bigger, more
accurate MIRV-tipped rockets virtuaily all the ICBM’s it is
permitted under the 1972 SALT I accords—1,320 of its 1,410
silo-based missiles. Before 1985, its present 1,410 warheads
would go to an estimated 6,700. With their large size, this is
more than three times the number of warheads needed for a
“high-confidence” strike at the United States’ 1,054 ICBM
silos.
The United States, under the Vladivostok agreement, can
replace all its first generation Minuteman III and Poseidon
158 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
MIRV missiles—800 of a programmed 1,030 already de-
ployed—with bigger, more accurate Minuteman IV and Tri-
dent I missiles. It plans, in addition, to add 288 larger Tri-
dent II missiles aboard 12 monster Trident submarines at a
cost of almost $1.5 billion each. With this program . . . the
Joint Chiefs of Staff reportedly are confident that they could
beat the Russians to a “first-strike” capability by two or
three years. :
A nuclear “Pearl Harbor” with its unforeseeable conse-
quences would not be initiated lightly by either side, of
course. But the existence of this capability on both sides
during a future crisis—and the massive advantage it seems
to offer for the side that shoots first—raises possibilities al-
most too horrendous to contemplate.
Crisis instability—the penultimate danger of the nuclear
era, second only to the ultimate horror of an actual nuclear
exchange—clearly has been brought closer by the failure at
Vladivostok to limit MIRV missiles to low levels.
. .. Without MIRV, an attacker must fire at least two
missiles at every opposing silo for high confidence of suc-
cess, thus disarming himself more than the enemy. With
MIRV, the attacker has the edge. One missile carrying six
warheads could destroy three enemy ICBM’s.
The editorial goes on with more figures and calculations—
or miscalculations. Armageddon is on the drawing board.*
The basic unconcern over what would follow if, or more
properly when, the accumulated thermonuclear weapons
fly out of silos, or out of submarine vessels, or out of orbit-
ing satellites—this unconcern is a psychological phenomenon
of no‘mean significance. The acquiescence amounts almost
to a desire to have the doom come. Do not the churchgoers
ask for the Second Coming, and do not business concerns
distribute to their shareholders profits from merchandise of

death, and do not superstates together with “developing na-
tions” live in anticipation, and is not the morbid disconcern
but a rejoicing in such anticipation? To consider others
being annihilated on a grandiose scale fascinates so greatly
that it is worth the risk of the same. Or will only the sinners
have their eyes gouged out, the teeth knocked in, the skin
peeled off, flesh burnt, and spinal column broken?
The SALT agreements are but a license to augment and
refine the arsenals and bring order into the chaotic business
of the rush toward turning this globe, eight thousand miles
across, into a salt plain of Sodom.
