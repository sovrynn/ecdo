TO KNOW AND NOT TO KNOW
I was compelled: by logic and by evidence to penetrate
into so many premises of the house of science. I freely
admit to having repeatedly caused fires, though the can-
dle in my hand was carried only for illumination.
A RECONSTRUCTION OF EVENTS
The repeated destructions of the world, which happened
as far back as the recollection of man can reach, and espe-
cially the last destructions, impressed themselves on the
memories of various peoples around the world in a manner
not to be wiped away.
In my published books I offered a reconstruction of some
of these events from the historical past, a reconstruction
built upon studying the human testimony as preserved in
the heritage of all ancient civilizations. All of them, in texts
bequeathed from the time man learned to write, tell in vari-
ous forms the narrative that the trained eye of a psycho-
analyst could not but recognize as so many variants of the
same theme; in hymns, in prayers, in historical texts, in phil-
osophical discourses, in records of astronomical observa-
tions, but also in legend and religious myth, the ancients
38 MANKIND In AMNESIA
desperately tried to convey to their descendants, ourselves
included, the record of events that left a strong imprint on
the witnesses.
I told the story in a brutal manner, in the sense that there
was little consideration for the complete unawareness of the
readers, living with nearly absolute repression of the most
significant of all racial memories, in almost complete obliv-
ion of the tribulations that agitated their forebears.
In my analytical practice I would never have perplexed a
patient with sudden revelation of the hidden motifs un-
derlying an affliction, without a preceding lengthy prepara-
tion in which I would carefully guide the patient to his or
her own insight. Only after such preliminary work had been
done could a startling revelation be risked and even then, in
some cases, the effect might be almost shattering—but by
that time the avenues of retreat into ignorance would have
already been blocked; by that time also the patient would
have understood the good intentions of the analyst and a
link of transference would have been forged. But in offering
an anamnesis, or the story of the development of the repres-
sion, to a collective suffering from amnesia, I have not fol-
lowed the same procedure—and I could not. Should I have
told first a curtailed story of great upheavals of the past—a
watered-down version—or administered it in small doses, a
teaspoon after breakfast? Should I have presented the story
as only possibly but not necessarily true? Should I have
offered it as science fiction? Should I have printed it seria-
tim or dismembered it among obscure magazines?

others—overwhelmed by

an

equally strong reaction of acceptance, acclamation and a
rush of missionary zeal to convert others. The demarcation
line that divided the camps ran with hardly any deviation
between those who did not read the message published as
Worlds in Collision, in 1950, and those who did. Those who
did not read it had, nevertheless, very outspoken views; they
knew “everything” by way of reviews, debates and gossip,
while a spontaneous reaction forbade their reading the book
itself.
The story told in that book is no mere hypothesis and no
idle theory: it is a reconstruction of events that took place in
the historical past, thirty-four and twenty-seven centuries
ago, or, in the main, close to one hundred generations ago.
Each page of the text bears references to sources, and
therefore the evidence presented is subject to control. The
narrative is horrifying and doubly so. On the one hand is the
anguished, bloodcurdling spectacle of our forebears suffer-
ing the paroxysms of nature. On the other hand is the horri-
fying realization that we were brought up in a deception—in
a view of the past which is but a guile that dulled our in-
quiry, put our vibrant curiosity to sleep, taught us, together
with our statesmen, philosophers and scientists, a lesson of
apathy as to our true destinies, and at the same time imbued
us with the self-assurance that nothing earth-shaking can
happen to us.
But our planet was involved in traffic accidents. The
length of the year, of the month and of the day have not
remained unchanged since the beginning: they changed
repeatedly in historical times when man was already per-
fectly literate and could leave records of the changes in
writing. They are in various scripts, notably in the cunei-
form. The data in cuneiform can be compared with the data
in hieroglyphics, and both together can be compared with
ancient calendars around the world, and with the sundials
and water clocks of bygone days, now defunct not because

As I said, the story was brutally told and there could only
be a strong reaction expected from such an analytical blun-
der, and indeed there was.
Yet, the liberating value of overcoming a repression of ra-
cial memories is much greater than the chance of psycho-
logical harm. The remedy lies in starting to teach my histori-

TO KNOW AND NOT TO KNOW
Freud wrote of two psychological reactions to a trauma.
“The effects of the trauma are twofold, positive and nega-
tive. The former are endeavors to revive the trauma, to
remember the forgotten experience, or, better still, to make
it real—to live once more through a repetition of it... .
These endeavors are summed up in the terms ‘fixation to the
trauma’ and ‘repetition compulsion.’” About the other reac-
tion Freud wrote: “The negative reactions pursue the oppo-
site aim; here nothing is to be remembered or repeated of
the forgotten traumata. They [the negative reactions] may
be grouped together as defensive reactions. They express
themselves in avoiding issues, a tendency which may culmi-
nate in an inhibition or phobia. These negative reactions
also contribute considerably to the formation of character.
Actually, they represent fixations on the trauma no less than
do the positive reactions, but they follow the opposite tend-
ency. The symptoms of the neurosis proper constitute a
compromise, to which both the positive and negative effects
of the trauma contribute; sometimes one component, some-
times the other, predominates. These opposite reactions
create conflicts which the subject cannot as a rule resolve.”

42 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
ISAIAH
In literature from classical times and the early Christian
centuries, and also later, we may observe a process whereby
the events that occurred in earlier ages fell into oblivion.
First there were those who knew—who witnessed the events
and described what they saw.
The prophet Isaiah began to deliver his message in —747,
in the days of King Uzziah, in the very day of the devasta-
tion caused by nature; he continued his orations as he grew
into a statesman, addressing himself to the nation and its
conscience, to the individual and his soul. As a master of
the written word, Isaiah has no equal in world literature. No
translation even remotely does justice to Isaiah’s Hebrew—in
its conciseness, its forcefulness, its richness of word and
structure. Isaiah lived in the time of the last series of catas-
trophes, and he could not have described them more clearly:
Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it
waste, and turneth it upside down. . . . the inhabitants of
the earth are burned, and few men [are] left.2
Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O inhabit-
ant of the earth... . for the windows from on high are
open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth
is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the
earth is moved exceedingly.®
Isaiah describes it all—the changes in the sky, the up-
heavals on earth and sea, the quaking of mountains, the peo-
ple fleeing, the migrations of entire nations.
The book of Isaiah, together with the writings of other

EARLY ATTEMPTS AT RATIONALIZING
With Aristotle (—384 to —322), there came a codification
of the oblivion assigned to the natural revolutions that oc-
curred in the historical past: the negation of such events be-
came a statute not only for philosophy but for religion and
science as well—and a dogma for political credo. But even
before the codification there was an early tendency toward
the process of obliteration. One of the mechanisms of oblit-
eration was what we shall call rationalization, or substituting
for the unusual what appeared to be less unusual.
One hundred years before Aristotle wrote his codification
(never, or hardly ever, challenged in science), Herodotus
visited Egypt and wrote down what he heard from the
Egyptian priests and from the guides to visitors from other
countries.
As I was able to deduce from a multitude of sources from
many parts of the world, the last major catastrophe took
place on the twenty-third of March, -687 of the Julian
44 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
calendar.t This was the night the army of Sennacherib was
destroyed by a “blast,” according to the Scriptures and the
old Midrashim. But Herodotus heard from the Egyptians
that when their king Sethos went with a weak army to Pal-
estine to confront the Assyrians and their king Sennacherib,
a multitude of field mice invaded the Assyrian camp during
the night and gnawed away the strings of their bows so that
the army, now disarmed, fled. Herodotus also added: “And
at this day a stone statue of the king (Sethos) stands in
Hephaestus’ temple, and a mouse in his hand, and an in-
scription to this effect: ‘Look on me, and fear the gods.’”
The event was actually caused by a close approach of the
planet Mars, displaced from its earlier orbit by Venus, in the
latter’s process of joining the planetary family. Although the
Chinese records for the night of March 23, —687, tell of a
star falling in a rain of shooting stars,® the scriptural and
more detailed Midrashic sources speak of a fiery blast, the
warriors’ breath having been extinguished; their clothes,
however, having remained unconsumed.® The event itself
was accompanied by a very loud noise. In Worlds in Colli-
sion I offered the surmise that “if for some reason the
charge of the ionosphere, the electrified layer of the upper
atmosphere, should be sufficiently increased, a discharge
would occur between the upper atmosphere and the ground,
and a thunderbolt would crash from a cloudless sky.”
Such an event is not “legal” in Aristotelian or uniformi-
tarian thinking: therefore it not only could not have taken
place, but should not even be mentioned. Yet its replace-
ment or rationalization by the story of invading hordes of
field mice who in a single night selectively gnawed away the

strings of the bows, the Assyrian army watching the disaster
and succumbing to it—this kind of rationalization does noth-
ing else but strain the imagination.
The obvious irrationality of the rationalization compelled
chroniclers to look for a more plausible explanation. Since it
is known that bubonic plague is transferred by rats, the
mice were replaced by rats, and the army of Sennacherib, it
is explained in books on history and theology alike, perished
from bubonic plague. To support this view it is pointed out
that Apollo Smintheus (Apollo of the Mouse) sends and
stays the plague in the Iliad (Book I).
“This is Herodotus’ version of the Jewish story of the pes-
tilence which destroyed the Assyrian army before Jerusa-
lem,” wrote a translator of Herodotus.’ But none of the an-
cient Hebrew sources (Scriptures and Midrashim) made
any such claim, even though pestilence was rampant and
was ascribed to the same disturbances in nature.
The scriptural texts made the event appear as instanta-
neous.® Yet it would require far more than one night for a
bubonic plague, or any other plague, to put to death an
army of 185,000 men, the number given in the Scriptures.
Interdisciplinary synthesis, or an approach to a subject
from more than one discipline, will help to demonstrate how
a phenomenon directly related to planetary disaster can
come to be paraded as miraculous, rather than involving a
derangement of the imperturbable order in the solar system.
Thus in Worlds in Collision, in a later chapter, I narrated
a tale told by the Menomini Indians, an Algonquin tribe:
“The little boy made a noose and stretched it across the
path, and when the Sun came to that point the noose caught
him around the neck and began to choke him, until he al-
most lost his breath. It became dark.” The Sun cried for

46 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
help, but no one who tried could help—“the thread had so
cut into the flesh of the Sun’s neck that they could not sever
it.” Then “the Sun called to the mouse to try to cut the
string. The mouse came up and gnawed at the string, but it
was difficult work, because the string was hot and deeply
embedded in the Sun’s neck. After working at the string a
good while, however, the mouse succeeded in cutting it,
when the Sun breathed again and the darkness disappeared.
If the mouse had not succeeded the Sun would have died.”?°
Now we have before us two stories in both of which the
“savior” is a mouse gnawing a string. But in the Indian story
the siring disrupted the movement of the Sun. Have the two
stories, perchance, no relation one to another?
In Herodotus the famous sentence telling the great secret
he learned from the Egyptian priests, that since Egypt be-
came a kingdom the Sun several times changed its wonted
path, is found in no other place in his History except imme-
diately, actually abruptly, following the story of the debacle
of the army of Sennacherib. The same sequence is found in
II Kings: the story of Sennacherib in Chapter 19 is followed
in Chapter 20 by the account of a disturbance in the move-
ment of the Sun—the Sun’s movement retreated on the solar
clock ten degrees.
We can learn from these three variants—the one told by
Herodotus in the name of the Egyptian priests and the sec-
ond told by the Algonquin Indians, compared to the third
preserved in the Scriptures (Isaiah 36-38, II Kings
18-20 and II Chronicles 32)—how man disfigures the past
to purge it of anything that violates his need to have
harmony and stability, to have “the heavens themselves, the
planets, and this centre, observe degree, priority and
place.”"

Herodotus, visiting Egypt in ca. —450, less than 250 years
after the event of March 23, —687, is unaware of accounts in
his own country of disturbances in the motion of the Sun—or
he writes them off as fables, not worthy of entry in his book
of history.
Egyptian priests, though knowing of the repeated rever-
sals of solar motion, confabulated the story of field mice
that gnawed the bowstrings, dissociating the event of Sen-
nacherib’s debacle from any disarray in the solar motion.
The American Indians preserved the memory of what
took place when the distended atmosphere of a celestial
body took on the form of a quadruped releasing the Sun
that appeared as if snared on a long string—but they made
the snarer a little boy, thus depriving the story of its true
dramatic elements.
Other tribes, especially of the South and North Pacific,
ascribed the “snaring” of the Sun to a demigod. The ac-
counts are presented in Worlds in Collision.
‘By contraposing this material we may learn also why
Apollo of the Greeks carried a descriptive adjective
Smintheus—“of the mouse”—and come closer to the under-
standing of Apollo himself.
But the main thing we may learn is that the process of ra-
tionalization set in only generations away from the events
that disturbed that which should never be disturbed.
PLATO
In the preceding section we saw the oblivion in the proc-
ess of setting in not too long after one of the natural disas-
ters, actually the last. But simultaneously with the phenome-
non of incipient, almost willful, amnesia, one can observe an
opposite current, a conscious effort to preserve the memory
of events that shook the framework of the earth, events in
48 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
which the entirety of nature—sea and land, Sun and Moon,
and all the celestial host—participated.
Fifty years after Herodotus visited Egypt, Plato came
there, hardly thirty years of age, soon after having parted
from Socrates, who drank his cup of hemlock. When Plato
was about ten years old he heard what Solon, generations
earlier, had learned from the priests of Sais in Egypt about
the cataclysms of the past, one of which caused the destruc-
tion and submersion of Atlantis.
Plato lived from ca. —427 to —347, and the last global
paroxysm preceded his time by less than three centuries.
The disturbances in the motion of the Sun must have been a
subject familiar to anyone who read Sophocles’ historical
drama Atreus, of which today but a short fragment is extant.
The Sun has risen in the east only since its course was
reversed:
Zeus . . . changed the course of the Sun, causing it to rise in
the east and not in the west.
Also the readers of Euripides or the theatergoing public
knew the passage in the Electra:
Then in his wrath arose Zeus, turning the stars’ feet back on
the fire-fretted way. ... The Sun ... turned backward
. . with the scourge of his wrath in affliction repaying mor-
tals.
Stoic philosophers taught the recurrent conflagrations of
the world; the Pythagoreans were immersed in speculations
of cosmic order and disorder; and before them, in Homer’s
Iliad, there are numerous scenes of theomachy, or war
among the planetary gods. The entire Greek pantheon is but
a pandemonium on Olympus; and Mount Olympus, in later
times located in several vicinities of Greek lands, was origi-
nally but the vault of the sky.
To Know anv Not to Know 49
It is therefore not surprising to find in Plato a number of
passages dealing with the subject of global or even cosmic
upheavals. I have quoted from a number of them in Worlds
in Collision. From The Statesman (Politicus) I cited Plato’s
discourse on the reversal of the cardinal points: “I mean the
change in the rising and setting of the Sun and other heay-
enly bodies, how in those times they used to set in the quar-
ter where they now rise, and used to rise where they now
set. .. . With the reversal of the terrestrial axis, the celes-
tial vault is reversed too. Plato continues: “At certain pe-
riods the universe has its present circular motion, and at
other periods it revolves in the reverse direction. . . . Of all
the changes which take place in the heavens this reversal is
the greatest and most complete.” Such changes were accom-
panied by decimation and also annihilation of species and
genera. “There is at that time great destruction of animals
in general, and only a small part of the human race sur-
vives.” .
In the Timaeus Plato describes the effects of a collision of
the Earth “overtaken by a tempest of winds” with “alien fire
from without, and with a solid lump of earth,” or by waters
of “the immense flood which foamed in and streamed out.”
The terrestrial globe, disturbed on its path, moved “for-
wards and backwards, and again to right and to left, and
upwards and downwards, wandering every way in all the six
directions.” The Earth’s axis is “at one time reversed, at an-
other oblique, and again upside down.” Plato spoke also of
cosmic and geophysical disarray with “violent shaking of
the revolutions” and “a total blocking of the course” and
“shaking of the course” which “produced all manner of
twistings, and caused in their circles fractures and disrup-
tures of every possible kind. .. .”
Plato was aware of the process of oblivion that erodes the
memory of such paroxysms of nature. In the same Timaeus,
Plato narrates the visit of Solon of Athens to Egypt, two cen-
50 MANKIND In AMNESIA
turies before Plato’s time. I shall follow Francis Cornford’s
translation:
“Ah, Solon, Solon,” said one of the priests, a very old man,
“you Greeks are always children; in Greece there is no such
thing as an old man.”
“What do you mean?” Solon asked.
“You are all young in your minds,” said the priest, “which
hold no store of old belief based on long tradition, no
knowledge hoary with age. The reason is this. There have
been, and will be hereafter, many and divers destructions of
mankind, the greatest by fire and water, though other lesser
ones are due to countless other causes. Thus the story cur-
rent also in your part of the world, that Phaethon, child of
the Sun, once harnessed his father’s chariot but could not
guide it on his father’s course and so burnt up everything on
the face of the earth and was himself consumed by the
thunderbolt—this legend has the air of a fable; but the truth
behind it is a deviation of the bodies that revolve in heaven
round the earth and a destruction, occurring at long inter-
vals, of things on earth by a great conflagration. .. . Any
great or noble achievement or otherwise exceptional event
that has come to pass, either in your parts or here or in any
place of which we have tidings, has been written down for
ages past in records that are preserved in our temples;
whereas with you and other peoples again and again life has
only lately been enriched with letters and all the other ne-
cessities of civilization when once more, after the usual pe-
riod of years, the torrents from heaven sweep down like a
pestilence, leaving only the rude and unlettered among you.
And so you start again like children, knowing nothing of
what existed in ancient times here or in your own coun-
try... . To begin with, your people remember only one
deluge, though there were many earlier; and moreover you
do not know that the noblest and bravest race in the world
once lived in your own country. From a small remnant of
their seed you and all your fellow-citizens are derived; but

The

[that]
. . .
there
was
an island
in

in

strait
which

on

there
had
grown
up
an
extraordinary
power
under
kings
who
ruled
not
only
the
whole

but
many

and

and

that,

they were
lords
of
Libya
so
far
as
to
Egypt, and
of
Europe
to

or

Plato’s words “a deviation of the bodies that revolve in
heaven round the earth” as the cause of destructions occur-
ring at long intervals need to be emphasized because they
are usually overlooked. Innumerable guessers concentrated
on “locating” Atlantis in all parts of the world, but not one
of them paid attention to these quoted words.
Aristotle was counted among the pupils of Plato. But seen
in the proper light, his thesis is the antithesis of Plato’s, who
sensed the heritage of the ages. Aristotle must have known
what Plato wrote and taught. Yet he was singularly disin-
clined to accept the words of his teacher as anything ap-
proaching historical truth. He did not argue against Plato;
he just disregarded what his teacher said in so many words
in his various works.

52 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
The
Aristotelian
negation
of
the
traumas
of
the
past, built
into
a
philosophical
system
that
covers
many
fields
of
human
knowledge,
became
the
rock
on
which
the Alex-
andrian
schools
of
physics,
geometry
and
astronomy
of
Ar-
chimedes,
Euclid
and
Claudius
Ptolemy
were
built.
The teaching of uniformitarianism (Lyell, Darwin) is a
nineteenth-century version of Aristotelianism. And as much
as the Church Scientific (Thomas Huxley's expression) still
follows in the steps of Darwin, it is still Aristotelian; and, in
following Isaac Newton in the study of celestial space and
the bodies populating it, the Church Scientific is again Aris-
totelian. And as much as the latter term is an equivalent of
Scholasticism, the Middle Ages are not yet at their end.
ARISTOTLE AND AMNESIA
The following section by Professor Lynn E. Rose was
prepared at my suggestion. In it Rose summarizes some of
the main themes of his book-in-progress on Aristotle.
Almost every page of the writings of Aristotle raises two
nagging questions: (1) “Why would anyone say that?” and
(2) “Why have people throughout the ages admired a per-
son who said such things?” These questions can best be an-
swered in terms of Velikovsky’s reconstruction of inter-
planetary near-collisions and in terms of his concept of
collective cultural amnesia.
The core and the frame of Aristotle’s system is his cos-
mology, which not only has been the most influential of all
cosmological theories, but also is the most excessive of all
such theories in its astronomical uniformitarianism. His
views are at the farthest possible extreme from those of
Velikovsky; indeed, Aristotle’s entire system seems
specifically designed to eliminate the very possibility of
To Know anv Not to Know 53
worlds in collision. That has also been the reason for its en-
during popularity and appeal.
Aristotle’s cosmological and other ideas were only rarely
based on evidence from observation and experience. His
ideas seem to have developed largely from his own imagina-
tion and from within his own psyche. For what purposes?
To gratify personal needs of his own? To serve the political
purposes of his Macedonian masters, Philip and Alexander?
To eliminate the-very possibility of interplanetary near-
collisions? It seems very probable that he was often serving
all three of these purposes at once. In any case, evidence
and argument do not tell the story, and we must turn to psy-
chological considerations if we are to understand the work-
ings of Aristotle’s mind.
The case of Aristotle is an excellent one for the applica-
tion and the illustration of Velikovsky’s concept of repressed
collective memories of global catastrophes and interplan-
etary near-collisions, and the ways in which those memories
manifest themselves. Indeed, the case history of Aristotle
is much more important than any other single such case.
It can be argued that all of the leading and distinctive fea-
tures of Aristotle’s system served, in one way or another, to
soothe Aristotle’s deep-seated fear of planetary catastrophes.
His denial of what had happened in the past went to such
extremes that he created a system in which interplanetary
near-collisions not only did not happen, but could not possi-
bly happen. Aristotle and Aristotelianism came to be the
principal theoretical obstacle to catastrophism. No one, in
the entire history of recorded thought, did more than Aris-
totle in an effort to de-legitimize catastrophism. There is evi-
dence of this not only in the physical and cosmological
works, but throughout the Aristotelian corpus.
Aristotle’s Earth is at the center of a spherical universe,
and is immovable. Within the terrestrial or sublunar realm
there is continuing change (this includes coming-to-be and
54 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
passing-away,
as
well
as
changes
in
quality,
quantity,
and
place),
but
all
such
processes
are
in
the
long
run
merely
cyclical.
There
is
no
genuine
transition,
evolution,
or
novelty
in
the
terrestrial
realm. In the
heavens
there
are
fifty-five
nested spheres concentric with
Earth.
These
invisible
and
mathematically
perfect
spheres
are
unchangeable
and
im-
-penetrable:
the
only
“activity”
that
they
are
allowed
is
that
of rotation
(no
other
change whatsoever
is
permitted
in
the
celestial
realm).
Aristotle assigns an “intelligence” or guardian angel to
each of the fifty-five celestial spheres to keep it moving at an
absolutely uniform rate throughout eternity. The poles of
each sphere are attached to and carried around by the
sphere outside it, in such a way that rather complicated pat-
terns of motion can be reduced to combinations of uniform
circular motions. Each of the seven “planets” (Saturn, Ju-
piter, Mars, Mercury, Venus, the Sun and the Moon) is set
like a jewel on the equator of one of the spheres. Each of
these planet-bearing spheres is enclosed within layers of
other, “unplaneted” spheres. Thus the planets cannot get
near each other, any more than they can get near us. Since
the planets do not move on their own, but are carried by the
spheres, and since the spheres do not move on their own,
but are moved by the “intelligences,” Aristotle has not only
removed the planets two stages from any originating source
of motion, but has ensured that the source of motion will be
rational rather than blindly irrational.
The Poetics might seem an unlikely place to look for Aris-
totle’s reactions to cosmic catastrophes. But we shall see, es-
pecially in Aristotle’s conception of the ideal tragedy, that
the Poetics is in many ways an even richer mine of informa-
tion than are his strictly cosmological works. For Aristotle’s
cosmology is simply an elaborate denial or repression of the
To Know anp Not to Know 55
past catastrophes; his philosophy of tragedy, on the other
hand, provides him with a way in which he can revisit those
catastrophes, safely this time, and with himself in full con-
trol. (Both the denial or repression and the revisiting would
be at an unconscious level.)
Aristotle emphasizes that tragedy presents “incidents
arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its kathar-
sis of such emotions.”* But Aristotle’s remarks about kathar-
sis or purgation never make it clear whether it is the emo-
tion that is purged of real import, or the spectator who is
purged of the emotion. It seems to be the latter sense that
Aristotle usually has in mind, but it might also be argued
that he intended for “purgation” to apply in both senses: we
spectators are purged of the emotions of pity and fear, and
the emotions of pity and fear that we feel are themselves
purged of the import that they would have if we were view-
ing real events rather than artificially staged imitations of
such events.
Aristotle recognizes various components of tragedy, in-
cluding plot and character. But it is only the plot, or the ar-
rangement of the incidents, that is crucial:
But most important of all is the structure of the inci-
dents. . . . Now character determines men’s qualities, but it
is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse. Dra-
matic action, therefore, is not with a view to the repre-
sentation of character; character comes in as subsidiary to
the actions. . . . Again, without action there cannot be a
tragedy; there may be without character. (1450a15-25)
Aristotle
calls
special attention
to
three features of the
plot.
These
are
the
peripety
or
reversal of the
situation; the
rec-
ognition;
and
the
pathos
or
scene of suffering. Aristotle's
preference
is
that the reversal of the situation
and
the recog-
13 Poetics 1449b; the Butcher-Nahm translation.
56
MANKIND
IN
AMNESIA
nition
should
coincide
(as
they
do
in
the
Oedipus Tyrannus
of
Sophocles).
It
is
often
said
that
“character
is
fate.”
But
the
fate
of
a
tragic victim,
as
Aristotle
sees
it,
is
a
result
of the
sequence
of
events,
and
is
not essentially
a
matter
of character.
Later
theories of
tragedy
emphasize
the
“tragic flaw” of the
vic-
tim.
This
tragic
flaw
is
usually-a
matter
of character,
and
is
often
a
matter
of
immorality
or
vice:
the
tragic
downfall
is
seen
as
a
consequence
of the
guilt
or
mania
or
other
per-
sonal
trait
of the
main
character.
The
plot
is
still
important,
of course,
but
it is
difficult to
see
how
any
proponents
of
the
“character
is
fate”
or
“tragic
flaw” schools of
interpretation
could
ever
agree
with
Aristotle that
the plot
alone—that
is,
the
action,
the
sequence
of
incidents
and
events—is
what
is
essential
to
tragedy,
and
that
there
could
be tragedy
even
if
there
were
no
character involved.
Aristotle
is
quite
explicit
that
the
downfall
is
“unmerited” (1453a4-5) and
that
the
victim
is
“like
ourselves”
(1453a5-6)
one
“who
is
not
em-inently
good and
just,
yet
whose
misfortune
is
brought
about
not
by
vice
or
depravity,
but
by
some
error
or
frailty”
(1453a8-10).
The
single
Greek
word
that
Butcher
translates
as
“error
frailty”
is
hamartia.
Aristotle
does
speak
at
some
length about goodness and badness
in
victims of
tragedy, but
it
must be
stressed that
he
does
not
present
the
moral
condi-
tion
of the victims
as
a
reason
for their
downfalls:
all
he
says
is
that
if
the victims
are
either too
bad
or
too
good,
we
feel
no tragic fear
or
pity.
In order
for
us
in
the
audience
to feel
pity
and
fear,
we must
see
the
downfall
as
“unmerited” andwe must
see
the victims
as
“like
ourselves,” that
is,
neither
exceptionally
good
nor
exceptionally bad.
These
are
the
onlyconsiderations
that lead Aristotle
to
mention
the
moral
sta-
tus
of the
tragic victims.
In Poetics, Aristotle unconsciously models the charac-
teristics of his ideal of tragedy after the characteristics of
To Know anv Not to Know 57
cosmic
near-collisions.
The
victims
of
such cosmic
catas-
trophes
(like
the
tragic
victims)
are
selected
independently
of
any
wrongdoing.
Their
downfalls
are
“unmerited” and
come “by
surprise.”
Their
fates
befall
them
from
outside,
and
their
characters
have nothing
to
do
with
it.
The
main
destruction
tends
“to
confine
itself
to
a
single
revolution
of
the
sun,
or
but
slightly
to
exceed
this
limit”
(1449b13),
in
Aristotle’s
words
concerning
the
dramatic
duration
of
trag-
edy.
(It
is
noteworthy
that Aristotle
relates
this to
the
Sun:
he
could
have
simply
said
“a
day
or
so”
without
mentioning
a
heavenly
body
at
all.)
Aristotle’s
conception
of
the
ideal
tragedy
preserves
these
and—as
we
shall
see—other
features
of
a
cosmic
cataclysm.
He
leaves
out of the picture
suchconsiderations
as
guilt
or
punishment.
“These then are the rules the poet should observe”
(1454b15), says Aristotle. One wonders if Aristotle has not
left himself open to the same sorts of charges that Glaucon
made against certain critics and that Aristotle strongly en-
dorses:
Critics, [Glaucon] says, jump at certain groundless conclu-
sions; they pass adverse judgement and then proceed to rea-
son on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever
they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent
with their own fancy. (1461b1-3)
Aristotle himself points out how rich and varied Greek
tragedy was, and how many were the discrepancies between
what he wanted and what was actually being done in the
theater. Most of it just did not fit the mold that he sought to
impose. The Poetics is full of allusions to those in the cen-
tury or two before Aristotle who did not write as he would
have liked. Aristotle himself seems time after time to “find
fault if a thing is inconsistent with [his] own fancy.” (The
Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles seems to be Aristotle’s fa-
vorite tragedy, one of the very few that he does not criti-
58 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
cize.) Aristotle is very narrow in his prescriptions, and he
rules out much of what had been done before his time, as
well as much of what was to be done after his time. An-
tigone, for example, was probably too good to meet Aristo-
tle’s requirements. Clytemnestra, on the other hand, who is
the real “protagonist” of the Agamemnon of Aeschylus, and
who appears in other plays as well, was probably not good
enough for Aristotle’s purposes. And it has often been noted
that Aristotle’s criteria would exclude such later tragedies as
Shakespeare’s Richard III or Macbeth, in which the central
characters are evil. Perhaps there are numerous people who
are closer to Aristotle in their thinking about tragedy than
they would be if he had never lived; but very few accept the
entire Aristotelian account, because that would mean that
too many excellent tragedies would have to be discarded as
inferior. é
All of the distinctive features of Aristotle’s theory of trag-
edy were attractive to him for reasons of which he was not
conscious—that is, because they all pertain, in one way or
another, to interplanetary near-collisions. The victims of
planetary catastrophes are, typically, “like ourselves,” nei-
ther exceptionally virtuous, nor exceptionally vicious. And
for that matter they are neither all fit nor all unfit, for the fit
suffer no less than the unfit in planetary catastrophes;‘* all
are frail reeds. Furthermore, the fate of the victims is un-
related to any tragic flaw in their characters: their fate is
“unmerited” and befalls them “by surprise.” For most peo-
ple, the recognition of the near approach of a planetary
deity and the peripetous collapse of their worlds coincided,
and their tragic stories were finished within “a single revolu-
tion of the sun.” Thus recognition and peripety come to-
gether in a cosmic cataclysm: except for an occasional figure
i 14 Velikovsky, Earth in Upheaval, page 228: “Fit and unfit, and mostly
iB seiatiacis
To Know Anp Not to Know 59
like Isaiah (who was probably only guessing), people did
not recognize that another planet was approaching until it
was upon them. And we certainly can feel “pity” for the vic-
tims of catastrophes and feel “fear” that the same thing
might befall us: their vulnerability and frailty is fearfully
like our own.
Aristotle was born barely three centuries after the last of
the interplanetary near-collisions, and the human species in
general had not yet succeeded in submerging its recol-
lections of those catastrophes into the collective uncon-
scious. Plato, in fact, had preserved and endorsed many of
the accounts of such catastrophes, accounts that Aristotle
and his admirers were soon to reclassify as “mythical” or
“unscientific” or “nonhistorical.” One function of myth in
Plato was to communicate a truth that could not readily be
communicated in any other way: “myth” was not a dirty
word to Plato. Another function of myth was to preserve an
account of past historical events: such an account was basi-
cally factual, not fictional. But in Aristotle, myth becomes
merely a part of literature; it is fiction, not fact, and is no
longer a part of history. Aristotle uses myth as a vehicle
through which to ease the tensions that result from his de-
nial of historical truth; the noble myths become mere recep-
tacles for emotional katharsis.
THE ROMAN PHILOSOPHERS
In the last century before the present era, Lucretius knew
about the catastrophes and wrote about them in his On the
Nature of Things. His contemporary, Cicero, the statesman
and philosopher of republican Rome, denied the possibility
of the planets changing their courses, and declared them to
be gods. The divinity of the planets he explained by their
60 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
occupying the sublime positions and by their unerringly fol-
lowing their paths.
“Therefore the existence of the gods is so manifest that I
can scarcely deem one who denies it to be of sound mind.”
This dogmatic thinking, changing the statute of faith but
not the mode of thinking, existed in all ages: in the Rome of
Cicero and Caesar, in Rome of the Catholic Church, in ob-
servatories of the present day. The categorical manner in
which the dissidents are castigated as being of unsound and
vicious mind can be seen again in the burning of Giordano
Bruno, and in the compelling of Galileo to recant on his
knees—and even in the coercing of the publisher of Worlds
in Collision to give up the publication.
The notion expressed by Cicero that planets are divine
bodies endowed with divine intelligence was deduced not
from the fact of their occupying the ethereal heights and
moving unerringly; these attributes were called upon only to
prove the existing idea of planets and stars being gods. And
the source of this belief, deep-rooted and widespread, was in
memories of natural phenomena and extraordinary events of
the past that grew dimmer with every passing generation.
Pliny, the Roman naturalist of the first century, could tell
of interplanetary discharges: “Heavenly fire is spit forth by
the planet as crackling charcoal flies from a burning log.”!®
Interplanetary thunderbolts, according to him, have been
caused in the past by each of the three outer planets, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn.
Seneca, the contemporary of Pliny, mentor of Nero and
philosopher, wrote that “the five visible planets are not the
only stars with erratic courses, but merely the only ones of
the class that have been observed. But innumerable others15

“The day will yet come,” wrote Seneca in his treatise De
Cometis, “when the progress of research through long ages
will reveal to sight the mysteries of nature that are now con-
cealed. A single lifetime, though it were wholly devoted to
the study of the sky, does not suffice for the investigation of
problems of such complexity. . . . It must, therefore, re-
quire long successive ages to unfold all. The day will yet
come when posterity will be amazed that we remained igno-
rant of things that will to them seem so plain. The five
planets are constantly thrusting themselves on our notice;
they meet us in all the different quarters of the sky with a
positive challenge to our curiosity... .
“Many discoveries are reserved for the ages still to be
when our memory shall have perished. The world is a poor
affair if it does not contain matter for investigation for the
whole world in every age. . . . Nature does not reveal all
her secrets at once. We imagine we are initiated in her mys-
teries. We are as yet but hanging around her outer courts.”!*
THE RISE OF ARISTOTELIANISM
The Dark Ages in Europe is the designation of the period
from the conquest of Rome by the Goths and Vandals in the
fifth century to the beginning of the Renaissance and Refor-
mation in the fifteenth. In learning it was the time of Scho-
lasticism, or the domination of the mind by the teachings of
Aristotle. In Moslem countries, however, the Renaissance ar-
rived several centuries earlier.
Three forces kept science from progressing and brought -
17 Seneca, Quaestiones Naturales, translated by J. Clarke (London, 1910),

62 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
about the Dark Ages: the invasion of the hordes coming
from the east and north; the influence of the Church, which
imposed dogmas and fettered the human spirit; and the
scientific dogma that petrified itself in a thousand-year-long
worship of Aristotle—through all the years of the Middle
Ages, with their crusades, Scholasticism and Black Death.
A strange amalgam of the Christian dogma and Aris-
totelianism became the credo of the Church, which regarded
the world as finite, and earth as the center of the universe
and immovable. The codification in the science of astron-
omy was performed by a distant pupil of Aristotle, Claudius
Ptolemy, an Alexandrian astronomer and mathematician,
the greatest authority in those sciences during his own age;
through all successive centuries until the time of Tycho de
Brahe and Johannes Kepler, almost fifteen hundred years
later, it was the undisputed dogma.
Islam spread to Spain in the West and to Bukhara and
Kashmir in the East. The Catholic Church dominated West-
ern Europe. America was not yet discovered. In both West
and East the Jews, a small dispersed minority, kept their an-
cient faith from which originally had sprung both Christi-
anity and Islam.
In the twelfth century Averrhoes (1126-98), a learned
Muslim and physician in Spain, wrote Aristotelian Commen-
taries and fused Islam with Aristotle; since then this fusion
has become inseparable. Moshe ben Maimon, known as
Maimonides (1135-1204), who was born in Spain but lived
and practiced medicine in Cairo, wrote The Guide of the
Perplexed and fused rabbinical Judaism with Aris-
totelianism. These two contemporaries, born nine years
apart, were followed by Thomas Aquinas (1224-74), a Do-
minican monk, who wrote Summa Theologica and fused Ca-
tholicism with Aristotelianism.
These three are regarded as the greatest authorities in the
theologies of their respective religions, and by their time the
To Know anp Not to Know 63
cosmic events in historical times had become misinterpreted
as metaphors: the Scriptures were censored.'8 The true mir-
acles of unchained elements, the resurgent chaos, the awe,
were denied emergence into the conscious mind.
COPERNICUS
Eighteen hundred years passed after the time of Aristotle
and thirteen and a half centuries after the days of Claudius
Ptolemy, and their teaching of the spheres revolving around
the Earth in the center of the universe survived unaltered,
and not only survived but dominated unchallenged. Univer-
sities of the Middle Ages and the Church with its philoso-
phers and theologians kept dogmatically to this doctrine.
In 1492, when Columbus discovered the West Indies of
the Americas, Nicolaus Copernicus was a youth of eighteen
years, enrolled at the University of Krakow. He further pur-
sued his studies in Italy, then returned to his native Poland
to become canon of the town of Frauenburg.
In 1506 or 1507, Copernicus began to work on his De
Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (Of the Revolutions of
the Celestial Orbs). He showed that the Sun, and not the
Earth, occupies the center of the universe, and demon-
strated that the Earth rotates in a daily motion and revolves
in a yearly motion. He did not, however, part with the con-
cept of uniform circular motion, nor did he understand the
nature of the fixed stars—great suns at immense distances—
regarding them as lights attached to an enormous sphere
that constituted the boundary of the universe.
In the 1530s, Martin Luther, who in 1517 had first broken
with the pope, came out against Copernicus, assailing the
“new astrologer who wanted to prove that the Earth was

Along
with
his
rebellion
against the
Roman
Church,
he
spurned
the

In the Preface to his De. Revolutionibus Copernicus
wrote:
I can easily conceive . . . that as soon as some people
learn that in this book which I have written concerning the
revolutions of the heavenly bodies, I ascribe certain motions
to the Earth, they will cry out at once that I and my theory
should be rejected. Accordingly, when I considered in my
own mind how absurd a performance it might seem to those
who know that the judgement of many centuries has ap-
proved the view that the Earth remains fixed as center in
the midst of heaven, if I should on the contrary assert that
the Earth moves—when I considered this carefully, the con-
tempt which I had to fear because of the novelty and appar-
ent absurdity of my view, nearly induced me to abandon the
work I had begun. How did it occur to me to venture, con-
trary to the accepted view of mathematicians, and well-nigh
contrary to common sense, to form any conception of any
terrestrial motion whatsoever?
Copernicus kept postponing the publication of his work
until he saw his days declining and a lasting night approach-
ing. Then he feared to appear before his Lord without hav-
ing told to men on Earth the truth disclosed to him. After
decades of postponement he was persuaded by his only
pupil, Rheticus, to permit him to publish his work, De Revo-
lutionibus. On May 24, 1543, a few hours before Copernicus
died the first copy was put in his hands.
What is it that was so unacceptable in the heliocentric
system? It is that man needs the feeling of security, a need
To Know anv Not to Know 65
based most probably on a hidden insecurity. A moving earth
is a less secure place than an unmovable one. Moreover, the
system denied man the central role in the universe; this was
injurious to his ego. It was also in conflict with the tenets of
the Christian Church; did Jesus come merely to a very sec-
ondary planet, one of many?
But among these considerations, mainly the awakened
feeling of insecurity was at the basis of the great anguish
that greeted the retarded announcement of the Copernican
theory. The great derailment of this planet on its travels put
a deep-seated fear into man’s soul; and as the deepest
traumas are relegated to oblivion in the soul of a single indi-
vidual, so also is the case with humankind.
GALILEO AND GIORDANO
When Galileo embraced the Copernican doctrine of the
Earth and other planets revolving around the Sun, he broke
not with the Scriptures, but with Aristotle. The Inquisition
interrogated him on his rejection of the dogma of the Earth
as the central body, the Sun with other planets revolving
around it, which is the Aristotelian teaching, not the scrip-
tural. The possibly apocryphal words of Galileo, rising from
his knees after recanting: “Eppur si muove!” (And yet it
moves! ) reflect the issue and the content of the crime. Only
in the opening chapter does the Old Testament appear to let
the Sun serve to illuminate the Earth for man’s sake. The
rest of the Old Testament speaks repeatedly of such events
as the Earth removed from its place, or overturned—ideas il-
legitimate in the codex of Aristotle. Actually, the Church as
the trustee of both the Scriptures and of Aristotle accepted
the latter almost straight, but with respect to the Scriptures
the Church devised a metamorphosis of the grandiose mira-
66 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
cles
of nature,
changing
them
into
personal
miracles
of
saints.
Galileo, himself a devout Catholic, made this sole devia-
tion from Aristotle—actually the deviation of the canon Co-
pernicus, whose work was published ninety years before
Galileo was brought before the Inquisition (1633). Galileo
did not dare to break as decisively as his contemporary, the
Protestant Johannes Kepler, who abandoned circular orbits
and introduced elliptical ones, or as completely as their
early contemporary, the pantheist Giordano Bruno, who re-
moved both the Sun and the Earth from their exalted posi-
tions by pronouncing the fixed stars to be suns, themselves
surrounded by planets.
Galileo and Giordano were punished according to their
trespasses: Galileo to eighteen days in the prison of the
Inquisition and house arrest till the end of his life; Giordano
Bruno to over seven years’ imprisonment and death at the
stake. Bruno, however, renounced not only the Aristotelian
immovable Earth in the center of the universe, but also the
dogma of the Immaculate Conception. This he had done
early in his life, when he deserted his cell in the Dominican
monastery at Nola on the slopes of Vesuvius—a cell once oc-
cupied, three centuries earlier, by Thomas Aquinas. Bruno’s
heresy was against both doctrines welded together by
Thomas, and on February 17, 1600, from the pile of faggots
kindled on Campo dei Fiori in Rome, he was sent to the In-
ferno by the Inquisition.!®
* NICOLAS-ANTOINE BOULANGER
The name Nicolas-Antoine Boulanger is not found in most
encyclopedias and is known only to a few scholars. He was a

contemporary of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire and Di-
derot, illustrious names in the history of French letters. He
lived only thirty-seven years, from.1722 to 1759. I came
across the name very late in my research, actually in 1963,2°
and read in his works a few years later. I found that in some
aspects he was the precursor of Freud and Jung as well as of
myself, actually solving the problem Freud and Jung left un-
solved. Namely, he understood that much of the behavior of
the human species, together with all the heritage of religious
rites and much of the political structure of his own and
other ages, were engendered in cataclysmic experiences of
the past, in the Deluge (or deluges, of which there could
have been more than one).
After Boulanger’s premature death, his works were pub-
lished by Diderot, but his geological observations were not
included in the printed volumes; extracts from these obser-
vations and reflections appear in a recent work on Bou-
langer,”’ and do not impress as compelling. But one has to
keep in mind that the age of geology as a science did not
start until after Boulanger’s death.
In Boulanger’s time, geology as a science was in a prena-
tal stage. But as a road engineer, his observations in the val-
ley of the Marne made him draw conclusions which he
found substantiated in the existing books of folklore and sa-
cred writings by the classical writers available to him either
in originals or in translation. He was convinced that the Del-
uge was a global occurrence, although this was no innova-
tion on his part but an accepted notion in his time. Bou-
langer, in fact, was the author of the entry Déluge in the
great French Encyclopédie edited by Diderot. In his books
he sometimes referred to the Deluge as a singular occur-

rence, but then again he spoke of multiple deluges. He
seems not to have had an idea where the water of the uni-
versal flood might have come from, and showed no
awareness of any extraterrestrial agent having caused the
worldwide calamity: none of the planets figures in his work
as involved in the upheaval. Neither did he connect the de-
scription of the events surrounding the Exodus with a cata-
strophic happening, nor did he arrive at the conclusion that
the speeches of the Hebrew prophets in the days of the As-
syrian domination (eighth century before the present era)
dealt with contemporaneous global upheavals. Nevertheless
he was ready to claim, at least on one occasion, that only
three thousand years had passed since order was established
in nature. Thus human beings must have witnessed these
upheavals; the human race suffered one or several violent
experiences, whose aftereffects are still with us:
“We still tremble today from the consequences of the del-
uge, and our institutions, without our knowing it, still pass
on to us the fears and the apocalyptic ideas of our forefa-
thers. Terror subsists from race to race, and the experience
of the centuries can only weaken it but cannot make it en-
tirely disappear. The child will fear forever what frightened
his ancestors.”??
In the broad generalization that our society, as well as the
savage society, still lives in the shadow of the experience of
the Deluge, Boulanger anticipated Jung and Freud and
spelled out the nature of this experience that influenced the
behavior of the subsequent generations. Frank E. Manuel
maintains that in Boulanger’s conception “there is no physi-
ological transmission of the postdiluvian terror, nor a theo-
logical incubus of sin, merely a historical tradition embodied
in rites, myths, ceremonials. Boulanger required no biologi-

cal mechanism or race memory plasmically inherited to ac-
count for the enduring effects of the trauma of the flood;
mere imitation and institutional inheritance was adequate, a
theory which allowed also for the relatively easy cure of
the disease and thus generated an optimism whose spirit is
to be distinguished from the traumatized humanity of
Freud.”?8
Neither Freud nor Jung knew anything of Boulanger, and
his name is not found in the psychological literature. It is
not so much his claim that catastrophic events took place in
the past that deserves attention; rather, Boulanger’s distinc-
tion lies in his contemplating the consequences of such up-
heavals for the human race. The idea of catastrophic events
in the past was already to be found in the writings of Wil-
liam Whiston, successor to Isaac Newton in Trinity College,
Cambridge, who claimed that the Deluge was caused by a
comet that returned in his own time, in 1680; again, Georges
Louis de Buffon, Boulanger’s contemporary, thought that a
massive comet hit the Sun and caused the origin of the plan-
etary family; and after Boulanger’s time the scientific
thought of the eighteenth century and the first half of the
nineteenth again and again sought the cause of the global
upheavals.
LAPLACE’S DICHOTOMY
In his Traité de mécanique céleste (1779-1825) Pierre
Simon de Laplace proved that the solar system, governed by
gravitation, is orderly and that the planets move on eter-
nally peaceful orbits. In his Exposition du systéme du
monde (1796), discussing the possibility of a collision of the
Earth with a comet, he began by belittling the chance and

the
result,
but
as
he
continued
he
became
noticeably
in-
spired,
and
soon
admitted
the
possibility
of
a
horrendous
effect.
Next
he claimed
that
many
problems
of
geology
and
of
ancient climate
must have
had
their
explanations
in
ex-
actly
such
an event.
Thus Laplace
displayed
a
dichotomy:
he denied
the
possibility
of
disturbances
in
the
solar
system
of
such
magnitude,
and
at
the
same
time
he
confessed
belief
in
the actuality of
such
events.
His claim that the solar system was not and cannot be dis-
turbed is well known, and this basic credo of modern astron-
omy is so often quoted that it is not necessary to cite La-
place on this score. As to the other statement, since reference
to it is systematically omitted from the scientific literature, I
shall reproduce it here. Should a comet of the mass of the
Earth pass close by,
the axis and the movement of rotation would be changed.
The seas would abandon their ancient positions, in order to
precipitate themselves toward the new equator; a great por-
tion of the human race and the animals would be drowned
in the universal deluge, or destroyed by the violent shock
imparted to the terrestrial globe; entire species would be an-
nihilated; all monuments of human industry overthrown;
such are the disasters which the shock of a comet would
produce, if its mass were comparable to that of the earth.
We see then, in effect, why the ocean has receded from
the high mountains, upon which it has left incontestable
marks of its sojourn. We see how the animals and plants of
the south have been able to exist in the climate of the north,
where their remains and imprints have been discovered;
finally, it explains the newness of the human civilization,
certain monuments of which do not go further back than
five thousand years. The human race, reduced to a small
number of individuals, and to the most deplorable state,
solely occupied for a length of time with the care of its own
preservation, must have lost entirely the remembrance of
To Know anp Not to Know 71
the sciences
and
the
arts;
and
when
progress
of
civilization
made
these
wants
felt
anew,
it
was necessary
to
begin
again,
as
if
man
had been
newly
placed
upon
the
earth.?4
I cite this passage of Laplace to illustrate a state of split
personality, not just of this savant, regarded as the genius
who brought the Newtonian system to its perfection, but
also of those who now, for almost two hundred years, have
preferred the fairy tale of a blissful world to the shocking
record of an earth in upheaval.
At the biennial meeting of the American Philosophical So-
ciety convened at Notre Dame University, in Indiana, on
November 2, 1974, I spoke of the desire of science to know,
and the equally strong desire not to know. Since Aristotle in
classical times, and Laplace in modern times, the desire to
know only so much and not more has dominated scientific
endeavor.
DARWIN
The extent to which the fear of recognition that we travel
on an accident-prone vessel governs the thinking of modern
science can be exemplified by a few instances.
Charles Darwin, as a young naturalist, visited South
America; it was in fact the scene of his by-far-longest stay in
the course of the circumterrestrial voyage on the ship Bea-
gle. He wrote in his Journal of his voyage (I have also
quoted the passages in Earth in Upheaval): “Tt is impossible
to reflect on the changed state of the American continent
without the deepest astonishment. Formerly it must have
swarmed with great monsters: now we find mere pigmies,
compared with the antecedent, allied races.”
He continued: “The greater number, if not all, of these

have
taken
place.
What,
then,
has
exterminated

Darwin did not know the answer and he wrote: “It could
hardly have been a change of temperature, which at about
the same time destroyed the inhabitants of tropical, temper-
ate, and arctic latitudes on both sides of the globe.” It was
not man who acted as a destroyer; and were he to attack all
large animals, would he also, Darwin asked, be the cause of
extinction “of the many fossil mice and other small quad-
rupeds .. .”? Darwin concluded: “Certainly, no fact in
the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and
repeated exterminations of its inhabitants.”°
Having seen what he did in South America, Darwin could
not but embrace catastrophism. He did not come by his in-
formation through mere reading: he saw the very remains of
catastrophe victims, not in museums, but in situ, in the
pampas and on the slopes of the Andes. Such an experience
is more compelling than literary information. Yet, two dec-
ades later Darwin propounded a non sequitur in ascribing
all changes in the animal kingdom to a very slow evolution
through competition, and by an extended dialectic he en-

deavored to demonstrate that the earth pursued a stable ev-
olution on a stable course of uninterrupted circling, because
the idea of a shaking of the entire globe was mentally be-
yond him. But he saw these animals, their bones splintered,
heaped in the strangest assemblages—giant sloths and mas-
todons together with birds and mice. He had to forget these
pictures of disaster in order to invent a theory of a peaceful
earth unshaken in its entirety—an earth populated by species
competing for livelihood, and benefiting from chance varia-
tions, all of them evolving from a few unicellular organisms,
as though mere competition (“survival of the fittest”) could
produce from the same animal ancestor a winged bird, a
winding snake, a rultilegged insect and man. With our
present knowledge of the phenomena of transmutations of
elements and biological mutations that take place in extreme
conditions, thermal or radioactive, we no longer need sub-
scribe to the idea that eons of competition for the means of
existence caused wings to grow on land creatures and the
entire population of land, air and water to evolve from a
common ancestor. But whatever the cause of evolution—in
his time Darwin could not know of the phenomenon of mu-
tation—the phenomenon of destruction of a multitude of
genera and species was known to him, and he could not pass
over it in silence in the Origin of Species. He wrote: “The
extinction of species has been involved in the most gratui-
tous mystery. . . . No one can have marvelled more than I
have done at the extinction of species.” But then he chose to
find an explanation in “wide intervals of time between our
consecutive [geological] formations; and in these intervals
there may have been much slow extermination.”
This explanation, assuming lacunae in the geological rec-
ord, without which there would have been found evidences

One may frame hypotheses for what one does not see, like
the hypothesis of geological gaps, the foundation of the en-
tire Origin of Species. But for what one does see, the evi-
dence of great cataclysms, it is no explanation to assume a
defective geological record.
The Christian Church maintains that animals have no
souls and that an unbridgeable gulf exists between the king-
doms of man and animal. When Darwin destroyed the sense
of absolute separateness of man and animal, he undermined
belief in the soul’s being separate from and surviving the
body. Thus Darwin deflated man’s pride in his origin and
uniqueness. But there was another aspect of Darwin’s
theory, without which the opposition to his teaching would
have been much more intense and prolonged. This was a
feeling of security about the peaceful history of our planet,
the abode of man—no catastrophic interruptions in all the
eons of the past and none in the future. For that assurance,
man was ready to part with the idea of his uniqueness and
agree to be counted as one of the animal kingdom. This did
not require his giving up his status as number one, free to
To Know anp Not to Know 15:
exploit and even consume any of his animal brethren, re-
gardless of their position on the ladder of evolution. He did
not need to accord franchise to horses or primates: his own
female folk were not yet granted voting rights. It was more
like finding that the genealogical list one thought to be gen-
- uine was actually not so, and the assumed nobility was not
based on the ancestors’ high ranking; there was no blue
blood flowing in the veins of the primates. This loss occa-
sioned the satirical question Bishop Samuel Wilberforce
directed to Thomas Huxley during their famous encounter:
“, . . was it through your grandfather or your grandmother
that you claim to have descended from a monkey?”
So man was offered an opportunity to barter his godlike
origin for the security of his abode. Darwin knew the sacri-
fice (in intangibles) he asked and the guarantee of peace of
mind he offered. Who cares for the past if the future is at
stake? Darwin made it clear on the concluding page of the
Origin of Species: “As all the living forms of life are the lin-
eal descendants of those which lived long before the Cam-
brian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succes-
sion by generation has never once been broken, and that no
cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may
look forward with some confidence to a secure future of
great length.”
Darwin ended the Origin of Species with these words:
“There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several
powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into
a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone
cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so sim-
ple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most won-
derful have been, and are being evolved.”
The plot now being settled, the drama of everyone against
everybody else could go on without any fear that the stage
itself would collapse. For man at the top of the ladder it was
like a license to devour or exploit the less developed—soul or

NATURAL EVOLUTION AND REVOLUTION
Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection appeared in November of 1859 and was an imme-
diate success: on the day of publication, the whole edition
of 1,250 copies was sold out.
In books on the history of science, and more specifically in
books on Darwin, one regularly reads of the bitter opposi-
tion the book provoked. This statement needs qualification.
It is true that the great names in science of the time like
Louis Agassiz, the ichthyologist, the botanist Asa Gray and
others expressed upon reflection great reservations at Dar-
win’s views, yet they did so without disrespect and purely
on scientific grounds. Agassiz pointed out that the skeletal
remains of a number of ancient and extinct species of fish
documented a better progression on the road of evolution
and a better adaptation in the struggle for existence than do
later species of fish, and thus the principle of the survival of
the fittest had not been followed through. But the academic
chorus in Darwin’s support was heard ever louder, and soon
the spectacle in the intellectual circles was a rush to join the
winning ‘team. Thomas Huxley in England and Ernst
Haeckel in Germany spearheaded the movement. Darwin
kept himself in the background, but occasionally instigated
his front fighters to demolish a scientific opponent, usually
among the clerics, by circumventing scientific argument and
attacking the critic personally, as was the case with a
French savant, St. Georges Mivart, who offered solid ar-
To Know ann Not to Know in
guments against the theory of evolution by natural selec-
tion. In his correspondence, Darwin referred to Lamarck, a
predecessor in the teaching of evolution, by then long dead,
as the author of “that wretched book.” Darwin also com-
pletely disregarded the work of the founders of the science
of geology—Sir Roderick Murchison, William Buckland and
Adam Sedgwick—of the early nineteenth century, who gave ~
the names, still in use today, to almost all the geological
periods—Cambrian, Permian, Ordovician, Cretaceous, etc.
He also circumvented by silence the founder of mammalian
paleontology and ichthyology, Georges Cuvier. These
founders of earth science produced consistent data showing
that catastrophic events on a global scale had repeatedly in-
terrupted the flow of natural history. Darwin followed
Charles Lyell, who was a lawyer by education and who
argued the theory of uniformity not as a savant, but as a
barrister; it was his book which Darwin read when he trav-
eled on the H.M.S. Beagle and which, as he acknowledged,
was his Bible.
Obviously there was a psychological need in Darwin to
shut his eyes to contrary evidence, but also a similar need in
both the academic and the lay society to get rid of the natu-
ral revolution by embracing natural evolution. One wonders
at the avidity displayed by scientists in the acceptance of
the Darwinian theory. None of the arguments that could
have been used against him was utilized by his opponents.
In his published diaries from his travels in South America,
for example, a number of entries point to a cataclysmic in-
terruption of the flow of the struggle for existence among
life forms. There was not only the instance quoted earlier
about the necessity to shake the frame of the entire world to
account for the massive and sudden extinction of a multi-
tude of animal species, but also the evidence of a rise of the
coast of Chile by over a thousand feet in a period shorter
than necessary for seashells to decay, and the repeated
transgressions of the ocean all the way across Brazil to the
78 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
foothills of the Andes. Yet with no new fieldwork by him be-
tween these observations and the Origin of Species, he
protested in the latter against catastrophic changes of land
and sea contours, and against any continental, much less
global, upheavals. None of these contradictions between his
diary observations and his views in his major work was raised
by any of his opponents. It was not brought up against him
that he had no academic position in a university, or that his
only scholastic degree was that of a bachelor of theology, or
that he omitted all footnotes to his sources, so that it was
often impossible for a reader to check on the data; none of
these shortcomings was ever mentioned by his critics. In ad-
dition to not heeding the solid finds of the still very young
geological and paleontological sciences, Darwin, with all his
entourage of acolytes, failed to learn of the work of his con-
temporary, Gregor Mendel, who evinced the basic laws of
heredity and prepared the foundation for modern genetics.
Darwin’s was the spirit of the Victorian age—an evolu-
tionary theory that was claimed to be a revolution, which it
was not. Darwin became the supreme authority, the symbol
of resolution of all questions, and a substitute for the Crea-
tor himself, who had to be suspected of being untrustworthy
if the Mosaic books were inspired by him and the story of
Creation now proved to be a fabrication.
The success of Darwin, the speedy acceptance of his
theory by academia, and the penetration of his theory into
all things spiritual and material of the last hundred years
was due to his assurance that the frame of this globe had
never been shaken.

By

Dar-

was
the
more

of the two.

saw
the enterprising,
but

the
unscrupulous,
take
advantage
of the
underprivileged,
the resourceless, the ignorant, the
unprotected—in
a
word,
the
unfit.
The
exploitation
manifested
itself
in
work
hours:
from
before

into
the night,
in
child labor

tances,
in
unhygienic
factories
and
perilous mines.

than
for

the

was
a
property
of
the
owner, but
the
human
animal was
easily
re-
placed
with
no
loss to
the
exploiter.
Marx observed and studied industrial relations, and came
out against the fit. The British Islands, having lost the Amer-
ican colonies at the end of the former century, now, under
Victoria, were expanding to become the dominant colonial
power in the world. The blacks of Africa, the dark-skinned
peoples of the lands bordering the Indian Ocean and vari-
ous other colors were enslaved as colonial people—and
though the colonial expansion of the British goes back to the
sixteenth century, it never reached the scope, the glamour
and the degree of extortion that it did in the days of Vic-
toria. Neither the House of Commons and the House of
Lords, nor the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, were in any
hurry with legislation for the protection of the exploited at

The
prophets were

against the

Marx even looked as we would imagine an Old Testament
prophet, notwithstanding his bow tie and the lapels of a for-
mal suit. But he denied all links to the old prophets. His was
a materialistic understanding of history. He even dismissed
his Jewish origin. At the age of six he had been baptized—
and one of his earlier works after he converted to commu-
nism was against the Jews.
The modern originator of the idea of communism was
Moses Hess, German-born, living and writing in France. To
him in 1840 came the young Friedrich Engels, and a year
later Engels introduced Marx to Hess’s ideas. Several years
thereafter they composed The Communist Manifesto, and
the movement began. Hess, however, soon sensed that the

and as if in prophetic anticipation of Stalin’s Siberian labor
camps and the subjugation of the countries of Eastern
Europe, wrote to Alexander Herzen, the Russian emigré and
anarchist:
As you know, I do not deny the possibility of such a death
without resurrection, such a definite victory of barbarism
and brutality; I only maintain that invasion, barbarism and
reaction are so inseparably linked together, that one inevita-
bly brings the others with it. To save your [idea of a] Slavic
invasion, the only thing that remains to you is to turn Social-
ism from what you . . . have made into a negative idea—
such as anarchy in the political sphere and atheism in the
religious—into a positive idea.?8
In the year 1862 Hess wrote Rome and Jerusalem, a work
of reawakened national conscience. He foresaw the huge
wave of anti-Semitism that would sweep France with the
Dreyfus Affair, and understood the problem of Jews in vari-
ous nations more penetratingly than Theodor Herzl a gener-
ation later. Herzl first thought of salvation for the race in
assimilation—but then in the days of the Dreyfus trial wrote
his Jewish State, not yet specifying where that state was
to be.
Karl Marx, still building on Darwin, as Darwin had built
on Newton, changed human history, yet neither he nor
those who followed him perceived that in the light of histor-
ical materialism and in the uproar of political revolution he
and they were emulating the natural revolution, not the nat-
ural evolution. The excesses of revolution, and later Stalin’s
purges, debased human beings, deprived them of the natu-
ral rights to freedom of thought, expression and change of
habitat, and made them into abject slaves. The several hun-

dreds beheaded on the Place de la Concorde in Paris in the
days of the French Revolution were followed in a century
and a half by millions brought to mock trials, imprisoned,
tortured and murdered, with Marx watching from his omni-
present portrait.
The foundation of the Marxian edifice was placed by its
author in such a way that it did not reach the bedrock.
Hence tribulations and possible collapse endanger the
edifice.
The doctrine of the fit, whom natural law expects, almost
obliges, to live off the unfit, developed in its next phase into
Nietzsche’s teaching of the Superman to whom all is permit-
ted. And the basis for the Hitlerian philosophy in the follow-
ing generation was prepared: out of “fit” and then “Super-
man” emerged the concept of a master race. Wagnerian
brasses called up memories of Nordic Valhallas, and the vio-
lence of sword and fire in the Bismarckian military drill im-
pelled the Drang nach Osten (drive toward the East). At
last the armies, goose-stepping eastward, met their doom as
they collided with the other end product of nineteenth-
century ideology.
TWO FORMS OF FEAR
A few weeks before World War II started, while in
Moscow signatures were being put on a document that
unleashed the thrust of the Nazi armies toward East and
West, I was with my family on my way to the shores of the
New World. During the years of war, powerless to change
anything on the world scene, I spent my days in reading, in
research, in thinking and in writing.
I would sit at the feet of the sages of many ancient civili-
zations—one day of the Egyptian learned scribes, another of
the Hebrew rabbis, the next of the Hindus, the Chinese or
To Know anp Not to Know 83
the Pythagoreans. Then I would rise to my feet to confer
with present-day scientific knowledge. At times I understood
what perplexed the ancients, and at other times I found an-
swers to what perplexes the moderns. This shuttle back and
forth was a daily occupation for a decade or more, and it be-
came a way to understand the phenomena: to listen to those
who lived close to the events of the past, even to witnesses,
and to try to understand them in the light of theoretical and
experimental knowledge of the last few centuries, in this
manner confronting witnesses and experts.
I realized very soon that the ancient sages lived in a
frightened state of mind, justified by the events they or their
close ancestors had witnessed. The moderns, however, had
to their disadvantage a dogmatic belief in uniformitarianism
—a hypothesis raised to the status of a fundamental law,
based on the premise that no cataclysmic events ever took
part in shaping the world and the life on it. I had to take into
account both shortcomings—the fear that often degenerated
into the worship of planetary deities, religious wars and su-
perstitions; and the fear that made modern man a dedicated
partisan of uniformitarianism: nothing could have taken
place in the past that has not taken place before our eyes, in
our days, or, say, in the days since Isaac Newton.
The two forms of fear had a common origin, but the late-
comers denied their ancestors’ wisdom—even their integrity
—in that the ancients’ message was but an anguished effort
to communicate the awe engendered by seeing nature with
its elements unchained. The adherence to the dogma of
uniformitarianism is a symptom of an all-embracing fear of
facing the past, even the historically documented experi-
ences of our progenitors, as recent as four score generations
ago.
84 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
A CHOICE
The content of Worlds in Collision was made known in a
summary preview by the writer Eric Larrabee, printed in
Harper’s Magazine for January 1950. Then in the New Re-
public of March 6, 1950, under-the title “A Distinct Choice,”
appeared this piece by Harold Ickes, who served as Secre-
tary of the Interior under Franklin Roosevelt:
We have been worrying to the point of hysteria about
Russia loosing a bomb on Washington or New York. Now
we can turn our minds to something different.
Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, one of the founders of the Uni-
versity of Jerusalem, has inspired a terror so beyond imagi-
nation that we may be able to shake off such trivial fears as
those of the A-bomb and the H-bomb. . . . He quotes from
ancient records and legends to prove that, in the wars be-
tween Venus and Earth, the latter almost succumbed to the
great heat that was engendered. . . . The very title of Dr.
Velikovsky’s book, Worlds in Collision, which will shortly be
published, is enough to scare out of us the fears that we
have been cherishing. ... [If another encounter should
take place] both Venus and Earth would be chaff in the
hands of cosmic forces that are uncontrollable.
In the circumstances it seems more than a little childish
for Russia and the United States to continue a race in arma-
ments that would melt into molten metal before the ardency
of the amorous Venus. It has happened that enemies can
spontaneously become friends when a present danger
threatens both. . . . Perhaps, without knowing what he was
doing, Dr. Velikovsky has conferred a great boon on all of
us. He has given us something to think about; something
even to pray about.... Perhaps we shall have sense
enough to put our heads between our hands and do some
real thinking about universal and lasting peace.

can be violent and cause an outburst of hatred; the person

of

An
illustrative
case
is
the
reaction
of
the
late
J.B.S.
Haldane
upon
reading
Worlds
in Collision.
Haldane
was
a
British
geneticist
who
claimed
the
mantle
of
a
prophet.
When
Worlds
in
Collision
was
published
in
England
he wrote
a
review
article in
The
New
Statesman
and
Nation
(November
11,
1950).
The
efforts
he
exerted
to
damage

under
several
headings.
His
scientific
arguments
need
not
occupy
us
here,
and they
are
answered
by

progress
since 1950.
Haldane,
among
other
things,
used
the
technique
of
as-
sociating the
book
with
the greatest
terror
living
in
the
Brit-
ish
nation
since

of

Hewrote:
I
regard
the
wide
sales
which
this
book
has
had
in
the
United
States
as
one of the
most alarming
symptoms
of ourtimes.
The
journals
(see
list
on
dust
cover)
in
which
it
was
boosted
are
those
which
may
urge
the
use of Britain
as
a
base
for
atomic
warfare.
A
large section of
the
Americanpeople
is
dreaming
in
terms
of
world
disasters,
and
Velikov-
ski will
certainly
encourage them
to
do
so,
if
only
becausehe
thinks that
the
world
may
well
be destroyed
by
a
cosmic
collision
within
a
few thousand
years,
as
it
probably
will
if
his
history
is
correct.
In
fact
the
book
is
equally
a
degrada-
tion of
science
and
of religion.
The “journals” quoted on the dust cover of Worlds in Col-
lision were the New York Herald Tribune and This Week
magazine. section, and neither of them was in favor of
atomic warfare or of making Great Britain the base for such
warfare. Worlds in Collision describes frightening natural
events that took place in the past, but is very careful not to
provoke any fear of repetitions of such events in the future.
I regarded the publication of Worlds in Collision as a
To Know anv Not to Know 87
warning against atomic warfare. Disaster may come, not
from another planetary collision, but from the handiwork of
man himself, a victim of amnesia, in possession of thermo-
nuclear weapons. The concluding paragraph to the Pref-
ace to Worlds in Collision reads:
The years when Ages in Chaos and Worlds in Collision
were written were years of a world catastrophe created by
man—of war that was fought on land, on sea, and in the air.
During that time man learned how to take apart a few of
the bricks of which the universe is built—the atoms of ura-
nium. If one day he should solve the problem of the fission
and fusion of atoms of which the crust of the earth or its
water and air are composed, he may perchance, by initiating
a chain reaction, take this planet out of the struggle for sur-
vival among the members of the celestial sphere.
Haldane also implied in his review that the author of
Worlds in Collision had deliberately left several clues to the
effect that the book was planned as a hoax and that it might
lead to world destruction.
This review, filled with misrepresentations that only an
unreasoned reaction could produce, was followed by a thor-
oughly misleading reply to my rejoinder in The New States-
man and Nation, February 3, 1951.
Haldane, a biologist and philosopher, wished to be known
as the embodied conscience of the scientific and philo-
sophical worlds. England, his native land, he believed, was
irreparably below all moral standards, and toward the end
of his life, irrationally attracted by the esoteric, he left for
India to die there.
Haldane’s fury came out of his own irritation, caused in
great measure by the impulses connected with inherited ra-
cial memories, while he himself believed in the right-
eousness of his cause. He felt the need to exorcise the spirit
88
MANKIND

AMNESIA
that
possessed him, but
instead
exorcised
my
book.
And
he
made
dishonest statements,
which
one can
understand
as
ir-
rational
and
therefore
excusable;
finally
he
went
off
in
search
for
a
nirvana—and
found
none.
Not
much
different
is
the
case
of
Eugene
Rabinowitch,
former
editor of the Bulletin
of
the
Atomic
Scientists,
a
jour-
nal
that
was created
to
expiate the
sin
of the
scientists
who
ate
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil,
and
then
built
atomic
bombs.
Dr.
Rabinowitch
embraced
the
mission
of
becoming
the
conscience
of the
scientific
community;
the
vision of
doomsday
was
relentlessly
before him.
He,
too,
projected
the
fear
of
atomic
disaster on
Worlds
in Collision.
In
1964,
when
a
series
of
“unexpected”
confirmations
re-
newed
the
interest
in
the
book, he
conducted
a
campaign
against
it,
whereas
the
accumulating
evidence required
the
opposite—a
careful
investigation
by
scientists
of
its
tenets.
He
engaged
H. Margolis,
a
journalist,
to
write
on
subjects
in
which
both
of
them
were
complete ignoramuses
(such
as

and
Egyptian
philology),
to
deflate
my

ofa

These examples, and they could be multiplied, document
the projection of fear of atomic disaster not toward its
source in our mental heritage, but toward the disclosure of
that source. It is a negative reaction, in Freud’s nomencla-
ture: a combination of not wishing to become aware of hid-
den springs, and an emotional reaction against that which
may bring awareness of the cause of the mental disturbance.

entists (April 1964).

A FIRMAMENT
The example of Darwin, a victim of amnesia with respect
to experiences of his fieldwork, is not a unique case. It is
more in the nature of a rule. The denial of terrifying experi-
ences, or the suppression of awesome thoughts suggested by
observations, can be witnessed again and again. Any one of
us who chances to have a mishap that is more than he can
live with in conscious memory is likely to deny the experi-
ence, Or misinterpret it.
From the many cases at my disposal, I shall select the
case of Loren Eiseley, anthropologist and historian of sci-
ence, and, at the time he wrote the book from which I
quote, provost of the University of Pennsylvania.
In 1960 he published The Firmament of Time. On the
very first page one reads:
. scarcely two hundred years have passed since a few
- wary pioneers began to suspect that the earth might be
older than the 4004 years B.c. assigned to it by the theolo-
gians. At all events, the sale of Velikovsky’s Worlds in Colli-
sion a few years ago was a formidable indication that after
the passage of two centuries of scientific endeavor, man in
the mass was still enormously susceptible to the appeal of
cataclysmic events, however badly sustained from the
scientific point of view. It introduced to our modern genera-
tion, bored long since with the endless small accretions of
scientific truth, the violence and catastrophism in world
events which had so impressed our forefathers.
Eiseley’s
book was written
to
combat
the
reemergence
of
the
discarded concept
of catastrophic interruptions
in
history
that
was the
teaching
of the
founders
of the sciences of geol-
ogy and paleontology
in
the early nineteenth century. But

struction of
numerous
animal
species
at
the
end
of the
Pleis-

or
Ice
Age,
at
the
beginning
of the
Neolithic period.
I
cited
a
paper
that
Eiseley
published
in
1943
when
he was
with
the
University
of
Kansas,
quoting
an
observer
of
the
awe-inspiring
scene
spread
all
over
Alaska:
. . in certain regions of Alaska the bones of these extinct
animals lie so thickly scattered that there can be no question
of human handiwork involved. Though man was on the
scene of the final perishing, his was not, then, the appetite
nor the capacity for such giant slaughter.
Because of the wholesale and rapid extermination of fauna,
Eiseley maintained, “it seems impossible to attribute the
phenomenon to the unaided efforts of man.”*! In this great
carnage are myriads of animals, limb torn from limb, in
great heaps over tens of miles, mixed with splintered trees.
It was not a mirage nor a phantasmagoria: other scientists
described it, too. The animals are from all kinds of habitats,
forms still existing and forms extinct, alike. The same phe-
nomenon is repeated in numerous places of the North and
South American continents. Eiseley wrote:
We are not dealing with a single, isolated relic species but
with a considerable variety of Pleistocene forms, all of

To Know anv Not to Know 91
which must be accorded, in the light of cultural evidence,
an approximately similar time of extinction.®?
In Earth in Upheaval I also quoted other authors of the
same school of thought as Eiseley, and their clear statement
that catastrophic events of continental, even global dimen-
sion took place. “At approximately the same time we wit-
ness a similar extinction of mammal faunas of Africa and
Asia.”** This is how I described the consensus concerning
the great extinction:
These species are believed to have been destroyed “to the
last specimen” in the closing Ice Age. Animals, strong and
vigorous, suddenly died out without leaving a survivor. The
end came, not in the course of the struggle for existence—
with the survival of the fittest. Fit and unfit, and mostly fit,
old and young, with sharp teeth, with strong muscles, with
fleet legs, with plenty of food around, all perished.*4
Eiseley wrote on this score that these facts:
. . . drive the biologist to despair as he surveys the extinc-
tion of so many species and genera in the closing Pleis-
tocene.*°
and again:
It seems odd that a fauna which had survived the great
ice movement should die at its close. But die it did.*®
He professed not to know the cause of extinction but he
described it in catastrophic terms. He could only state that

The
“despair”
of
the
scientist
turned
into
denial
of
catas-
trophes,
a
very
interesting
and well-authenticated psycho-
logical
problem.
Alexis Carrel,
a
biologist
who
was
much
in-
terested
in
psychology, wrote
in
Man,
the
Unknown
concerning
this
phenomenon
of
denial
as
it
applies
to
scien-
tists
and
the
problems
for
which
they do
not
know
an
an-
swer:
Certain matters are banished from the field of scientific
research, and refused the right of making themselves
known. Important facts may be completely ignored. Our
mind has a natural tendency to reject the things that do not
fit into the frame of the scientific or philosophical beliefs of
our time. After all, scientists are only men. . . . They will-
ingly believe that facts that cannot be explained by current
theories do not exist.
Returning to Eiseley’s The Firmament of Time, we read:
Catastrophism, in essence, may be said to have died of
common sense. As a modern historian, Charles Gillispie, has
commented, “To imagine the Divine Craftsman as forever
fiddling with His materials, forever so dissatisfied with one
creation of rocks or animals that He wiped it out in order to
try something else, was to invest Him with mankind's attri-
butes instead of the other way about.”
This argument against catastrophism does not sound per-
suasive or even remotely scientific; the catastrophists of the
nineteenth century were operating with geological and pa-
leontological evidence, not with theological argument. Eise-
ley followed the quote from Gillispie with the statement:
“Slowly the accumulation of geological information began
To Know anv Not to Know 93
to lead back toward the pathway pursued earlier by James
Hutton. . . .” And Charles Lyell, who was born in the year
Hutton died, “saw no evidence of world-wide catastrophes.
He observed, instead, local disconformities of strata, the rise
and fall of coast lines, the slow upthrust of mountain sys-
tems.”
But if Lyell (who relied mainly on observations of others)
did not see such evidence, Eiseley himself saw it. How,
then, does it come about that he lost sight of it, when he de-
nied that such evidence exists?
It existed also in the days of Lyell, and it was as unambig-
uous as that which Eiseley a hundred years later observed
and described.
As a psychoanalyst I returned many times to the problem
of awakening the human conscious mind to the forgotten
heritage of ages. The traumatic experiences that humans
keep buried in oblivion possess enormous power over the
destiny of nations. If the human race is not made able to
face its past, the traumatic experience that caused cultural
amnesia will demand repetition—and since the atomic age
began, humans have lived under the sword of Damocles.
