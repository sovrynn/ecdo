Chapter VII
A CHRONICLE OF OUR TIME
The entire chapter that follows should be read as a running
commentary on some of the events of the last two decades.
Each section of the chapter was written at or near the time
of the events that it describes, whether student unrest, Wa-
tergate or Jonestown. It is for this reason that persons now
deceased, such as Mao, or now deposed, such as Amin, are
sometimes referred to in the present tense.
MNEMES AWAKENED
What is behind the great shift that, with the young gener-
ation in its grip, changes society to such an extent that a zo-
ologist would suspect strong mutants in action, and if a simi-
lar shift were taking place in primates or quadrupeds, would
emphatically proclaim the arrival of new variants, even of
new species? A nineteen-year-old hippie and his middle-
aged parent in outer appearances do not appear one and the
same species, but in their thinking and behavior they are not
even of the same genus. The well-groomed, properly dressed
parent is in pursuit of everything his own parent was—ad-

What is beneath this complete change of inner and outer
values? What drives young men or women to such a resolute
separation from their fathers’ and mothers’ ways of life and
ambitions? What makes them prefer a sleeping bag to a
well-sheeted bed? A life with hardly any shelter to a life se-
cured by parental care, in a suburban ‘villa, protected by
stocks and bonds?
What causes, then, a well recognizable portion of the
young generation to strive in the opposite direction? What is
it that makes them reincarnate the caveman in appearance,
though even a caveman probably knew to shave his face
with flint? A caveman without a club—instead, a flower.
Is it a reawakening of the Essene movement, of which we
learned from the Dead Sea scrolls? Are these hippies a reli-
gious group frightened by the expectation of doomsday? Do
they emulate the early Christian sects by opposing violence?
They are frightened. They were running away to some
“safe” location at the approach of an asteroid, Icarus, that
with its million- or billion-ton mass was expected to nearly
cross Earth’s orbit in 1968. They have been most concerned
—actually in trepidation—at the prophesied possibility—for
many of them certainty—of California’s slipping into the
ocean because of a breaking away along the San Andreas

It appears that, born of parents who lived, and some who
fought, in World War II, and of grandparents who lived and
some who fought in World War I, the new generation look-
ing back into a past filled with violence senses the approach-
ing doom.
A man who wished to lead human society to peace de-
vised the original formula underlying atomic weapons—and
destruction; before him, the man who invented dynamite es-
tablished a yearly prize for peace: which of the contra-
dicting endeavors of each man prevailed?
Therefore, pessimism grips those who are about to enter
their adult life; but the conscious realization of the possi-
bility of a holocaust, a realization built on twentieth-century
history, is not the entire story: something in the unconscious
mind of human society began to make itself felt. Something
provoked it to half-awakening; a throb in the arteries, a hid-
den key to the endocrine system, the solar plexus, medulla,
gray matter—wherever the ancient terror had dug itself in,
something started to vibrate slightly differently, the key
made a partial turning, some mnemes lit up, a spark flying
forth and back and around the million cells holding the
engrams of racial origin—a network. crisscrossed by flashes.
In the Sistine ceiling painting by Michelangelo, Adam is
awakening as an outstretched arm with an extended finger
reaches to meet his hand. But it is not a flying bearded man
attired in robes, a God father, who awakens Adam. The call

LATE 1960S: STUDENT UNREST
University campuses grew malcontent and soon turned
into scenes of violence. Presidents and other administrators
were locked in their offices, furniture and laboratory equip-
ment were smashed, archives were dispersed or thrown
through windows, or burned; entrances to public rooms
were blocked, police were fought, barricades were erected.
Student unrest has been sifted by many authorities for
causes elusive and explosive. Some said it was motivated by
political issues, by left- or right-wing causes, by militant
pacifism, by integration problems, by sex, its license and
deviations; others said that it was a manifestation of nihil-
ism, of hippies’ distaste for orderliness and regulation, of
teenage drinking, mass drug addiction, or of a religious up-
surge. What force, then, was really behind the unrest?
It was motivated by all of the foregoing, but more than
anything else by students’ realization that in a new age of
man, as different from the over-stayed Victorian age as that
was from the neolithic, they are being instructed by inade-
quate methods, from antiquated textbooks, by teachers
whose recognition of a new era in sciences and humanities is
often discernible only in a feverish pursuit of grants.
A CHRONICLE OF OuR TIME 183
Wherever I have gone at the invitation of college and uni-
versity groups I have found the students and the more
thoughtful of the faculty appalled by the inadequacy of the
training offered, in an era when man has already burst the
frame of his tiny world with its petty rivalries and has taken
the first steps into a larger cosmos, having only one score of
years earlier released the energy of the microcosmos.
The science of several decades ago, perpetuated in college
textbooks, is full-of outdated views bequeathed from the
nineteenth century. The college teacher, with few excep-
tions, is an authoritarian because of his inner insecurity and
frustration. Fossilized notions are offered as ultimate truths
eliminating any need for further probing and thinking.
Geology is taught according to uniformitarian principles
laid down long before oceanographers and students of pa-
leomagnetism discovered evidence of global violence in re-
cent time; in astronomy, newfound knowledge of inter-
planetary magnetic fields, electric charges on the Sun and
planets, and plasma in space is kept out of most college text-
books—or referred to only in prefaces; the high heat and ret-
rograde rotation of Venus, gases escaping from a Moon
long thought to be cold to its core—such anomalies carry no
explanation in the astronomy taught in the colleges.
Disquieting news arrives in an incessant stream from arc-
tic regions, from the bottom of the oceans, and from archae-
ological sites around the world, and in disturbing data from
radiocarbon-dating laboratories, from paleomagnetic stud-
ies, from paleontological finds.
It is already sensed that the theory of evolution built on
the Malthusian principle of competition for means of liveli-
hood producing new characteristics in species—the only
mechanism offered for the evolutionary process—is divorced
from the truth. The coming of entirely new forms of life is
just a few decades away, practically around the corner, with
all the agents—radioactive, chemical and thermal—necessary
184 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
to change the animal and plant kingdoms already available
for the task to be performed—in the laboratories, one hopes,
not in a nuclear holocaust with attendant degeneration.
The house of knowledge, stable and everlasting only two
decades ago, is now all torn by fissures, with walls bulg-
ing or caving in, foundations removed from under the struc-
ture, roof collapsing. Ancient history, anthropology, social
sciences, philosophy, and psychology, all of them experi-
enced tremors and shocks and collapses, though the care-
takers of these domains too often pretend that the old values
are inviolable. In front of these structures the guardians pre-
tend that all is perfect inside; where a disagreement exists,
there is an apparent agreed partition of the territory among
the competing proponents. In psychology, for example, ad-
herents of “schools” swear by their chosen masters, having
made no progress in a generation, unconscious of the ines-
capable need—or unwilling—to face at last the issue of racial
memories.
Evaluating new scientific theories presents problems for
the power structure within the scientific establishment, with
a few hierarchs clamping lids tightly over the jugs of fer-
ment and inquiry; the scientific press serving a policy of
keeping the general public and even the scientific commu-
nity in ignorance of the interdisciplinary significance of
newly discovered facts; the chorus of grant distributors and
grant recipients, a self-perpetuating upper crust, living off
science and honoring its great ones by naming college build-
ings and institutions after them; the students who sense that
they are distracting their professors from “projects” and
from soliciting funds, and from writing the reports on funds
spent and more needed; the teachers in the humanities—
C. P. Snow’s “other culture”—envious of scientists and strain-
ing their brains for ways to formulate a fat project with a
meager idea; “thinkers” scurrying from coast to coast and
from foundation to foundation; the retreat of brains from

How not to rebel?
DISMAYED AND CONFOUNDED
The rebellion of the young was full of hope—the millen-
nium was about to begin. The hair was grown long, John the
Baptist was imitated in appearance, but the rebellion was
against asceticism as well as against materialism; regulations
were to be violated, young and not-so-young flocked to
“rapport psychology,” which struck out Freud and the rest of
the “schools”; orgies were practiced as curriculum in some
campus classrooms as the call came for tearing down all in-
hibitions.
Pot and acid, uncombed hair, colorful patches on torn
trousers, four-letter words filling belles lettres—and the vi-
sion of John the Baptist turned out to be a Halloween
mask. With knives and shotguns young girls massacred rev-
186 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
elers unknown to them, on the stages cohabitation was
played nightly, Christ was feted as superstar; but the millen-
nium loomed farther away than ever. The movement ran out
of momentum; a circle came full and once around and full
again and there was no exit from the purgatorium; the aura
of a decade earlier was no longer a sign of a millennium but
of decadence, a signal for parting with all values. Drug
pushers claimed to be modern prophets; the naive and the
innocent sucked into the whirl looked longingly for a true
prophet, and there was none in the cathedra and none in
the pulpit and none in the woods. The maimed in Vietnam
were received back by the society that sent them as if they
were lepers, were turned away from all doors, the drug
addicts among them even from veterans’ hospital wards. At
the “crossroads of the nation” flashing signs advertised hor-
ror pictures and homosexuals peddled their services.
The “new left,” anti-Semitic and with many Jews in its
ranks, keeps pointing toward the other superstate, the So-
viet Union. But the other superstate is a house of de-
tention. The news media there are censored and for decades
now have printed only the dullest resolutions of production
quotas, and writers are told what to write. Writers who
deviate are put into prison; twice Nobel-prize-winning au-
thors were thrown out of the literary institution and called
scum of the earth. In Z, a film about happenings in Greece,
shown to uncounted millions, the Russians export their art
to Greece—the Bolshoi Ballet—but the Americans export
atomic weapons; the Greek organizers of a demonstration of
protest against atomic weapons are mauled and the permit
for a public meeting is revoked. In Soviet Russia, however,
no such permit would ever be asked for or given. Seven
brave men who one day assembled on the huge Red Square
to demonstrate for liberties were sent to psychiatric wards,
this being the new punishment for dissent, whereby the gov-
A CHRONICLE oF OuR TIME 187
ernment avoids the embarrassing situation of holding trials
of people whose only crime is unconventional thinking.
Then where is the land of promise? Are the eight hundred
million blue ants, all lifting the little red book with the
thoughts of Chairman Mao, free beings? They may believe
that they are, but they are not—one brain serves for all of
them.
In their agony, the young, in a land where the Consti-
tution permits deviation, try it in all] directions, but finally
find themselves disoriented and leaderless, confounded and
dismayed.
MAN LANDING ON THE MOON
Man’s eternal dream is to go to heaven alive; an urge to
cast off the shackles binding him to the rock of his birth and
to soar and touch with his mortal body one of the planetary
gods or goddesses; a longing for a visit to paradise without
first going to the grave, and without passing through purga-
tory; ascension while alive, like Elias who went up in a char-
iot of fire (or was consumed in a ball of lightning), but with
a return to Earth; to participate in the banquet of gods... .
It was a long way. What a drive from times barbaric, a
jealousy buried in the genes of a biped envious of the avian
family—eagles and hawks, even lowly sparrows; a prince of
creation born without wings, looking longingly at caravans
of migrating birds: they can soar; he was born to crawl. He
bound sails to his back and glided, falling and dying. But
then he broke that barrier and surpassed the birds—not yet
in 1903 at Kitty Hawk when a glider supplied with a motor
lifted and carried him for nineteen seconds, but a few dec-
ades later, when fleets of huge metallic birds went on to
carry millions of passengers across the continents and the
188 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
oceans.
The
ultimate
goal,
however,
stayed
always
the
same:
heaven
itself.
Soon after the first Sputnik went into orbital flight, Laika
and Belka, dog passengers (the raven and the dove of the
Noachian ark), preceded man in ninety-minute travels
around the globe (an improvement over the eighty days of
Jules Verne’s hurried land and sea trek). Soon the first man
was sent into orbit and the message came from a Soviet as-
tronaut: “I have not seen God there.” Then were the laws of
nature that made his flight possible decreed by the wizards
of technology who sent him off the ground?
When in December 1968 the Apollo 8 crew was circum-
navigating the Moon, one of the crew read to all the awe-
stricken earthlings who followed their flight: “In the begin-
ning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth
was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face
of the deep... .”
Seven wie ee eaten crew was on a mission to
touch the Moon, plant human feet on her, bring back of her
divine body—of a goddess of all ancient creeds. The entire
population of the Earth with access to television watched
Neil Armstrong step on the Moon, and man—all the family
of man—felt a supreme achievement: no longer true were
the words, “Earth is the lot of man and the heaven is the
Lord’s.”
But Armstrong and Aldrin, stepping on the Moon, knew
that they did not come to a banquet of gods: the banquet
hall was a most desolate landscape of pits and strewn stones,
with a black sky over them, and no sound—even if one
shouted, even if mountains burst and lunar strata slid. The
astronauts performed a ritual dance and left the Tranquillity
station strewn with their refuse—the descent module, some
instruments and a plastic flag—a Salvador Dali phantas-
magoria.
Reverse of ancient values: the hell is now above, the para-

The vision of ancient terror—man wished to forget it: on
the second day of the returning flight one of the astronauts
inquired—and the whole world could hear—“What’s the
trend on the New York stock exchange? Stocks and bonds?”
Being told that stocks and bonds were lower, he resigned
himself by observing that one cannot go to the Moon with-
out some punishment.
The President of the United States promised a rock apiece
to all heads of friendly governments on Earth. The scien-
tists who came to see the quarantined stones were all too
eager to persuade themselves that the catastrophe that be-
fell the Moon took place earlier than her association with
the Earth—a lullaby with which the Earth science since
Aristotle has soothed man’s awareness of the great events his
ancestors witnessed.
But the unawareness, sanctioned by the neo-Aristotelian
view, is also the cause of man’s wretchedness. At the time
that Apollo 8 with its three men, the precursor of Apollo 11,
was circling the Moon in December 1968, ambassadors at
the Vietnam peace conference in Paris spent days, and then
190 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
weeks, discussing the shape of the conference table, prelimi-
nary to the beginning of any negotiations. At the time of
Apollo 11, men—same genus, species and variety—bogged
down in swamps, still fought a senseless war. If the three
men had perished on their lunar voyage, how deeply be-
reaved the human family would have felt; but fewer than
one hundred Americans killed in a week in Vietnam—
besides the maimed—was something almost to rejoice in; for
many weeks not so negligibly few had met their death.
In Biafra, hundreds of thousands starve; in the Middle
East, hundreds of millions of Arabs from Morocco to Iraq
and the Sudan besiege a small and dedicated remnant of a
race that—counting dead and alive—was never for the last
three thousand years a minority in Palestine; on the Ganges,
hungry human masses carry on a wretched existence; in the
waters of the oceans atomic submarines scurry, ready to
send out thermonuclear missiles on populated cities; and in
the vastness of Siberia two supernations prepare for Arma-
geddon.
PAGES FROM A NEWSPAPER
Two days of newspaper reading—even only a paragraph
here and a paragraph there—and the implications for the
palpable future of the human race grew alarmingly threat-
ening. The President of the United States negotiated in the
capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with its
leader concerning the limitation of the atomic weapons race
—and all that was achieved was to agree on the limitation of
the defense of civil population, but not the limitation of the
development and manufacture of the atomic warheads, at
least not for the ensuing eleven years. I told this to the first
man I chanced to converse with that day. “Is it possible,” he
exclaimed, “to leave the population unprotected, while an
A CHRONICLE OF OuR TIME 191
unbridled
race
for
more and more
developed
atomic
war-
heads
is
going
on?”
He
thought
I
erred
in
my
reporting
of
what
I
read.
I did
not
err.
“I would understand an agreement on the development
of protection for the civil population while desisting from
creating more powerful and more sophisticated weapons of
annihilation,” he said as if reading my thoughts. But, as we
have learned, there is no logic where both sides negotiate at
a table under which is an abyss—where both sides are basi-
cally irrational. Man as a species is irrational, and those most
susceptible to the atavistic urge for self-destruction have
only a thin skin over their lust for kindling a global holo-
caust.
The newspaper reports: Soviet Russia has atomic weap-
ons of more formidable thrust; the United States has devel-
oped multiple warheads superior to those of the communist
arsenal. And the communist camp insists on a prolonged pe-
riod of unrestricted development of multiple-warhead mis-
siles.
The infant and the young are heading toward a simulta-
neous charred death; and I cannot help remembering the
stench of burned horseflesh in a stable that I, at that time
probably four years old, was brought to see a few days after
a fire.
Another item is almost happily presented to the readers of
the newspaper: in a few years there will be two dozen
' members in the atomic bomb “club.” Richard Nixon on a
quasi-peaceful and triumphal visit to the Middle East prom-
ised an atomic plant to Egypt; India, which received pluto-
nium from Canada for peaceful purposes, recently exploded
an atomic bomb, while Indira Gandhi, still professing that
the atomic plant is solely for peaceful purposes, promises,
according to another newspaper item, soon to explode a ther-
monuclear bomb. The majority of India’s population of 600
million is near starvation; poor and wretched and hungry,

The generation is also without a prophet, or singularly
poor in leadership; there is nobody to whom to listen; a gen-
eration of advanced technology, with nobody of ethical stat-
ure whose voice should be compelling. Former generations
had such leaders. Alexander Solzhenitzyn saw the iniquity
on a grandiose scale, with human beings dehumanized by
the dictatorial state in inquisition chambers, in prisons, in
slave labor camps, in mental institutions. But the cure he
saw was in a return to the mystical Slavophile movement—
Russia as a third Jerusalem, a rural society, as if material
civilization is of the devil, as Leo Tolstoy, latter-day
prophet, felt in his final years.
On television, about the time of the release of the news
from the Moscow summit conference, the American viewer
was accosted by the spectacle of a young, sixteen-year-old
guru who had just taken a bride, with “God” written over
his head and throne. This is not only not considered blas-
phemy, but donations to him are deductible and his income
is tax-free, as is normal in the United States where, by con-
stitution, state and church are separated.

THE FIRE GATE
For two years the United States was in the throes of polit-
ical scandals known collectively by the name of Watergate.
The nation was baffled, even stupefied by the unbelievable
disclosures. Watergate was all about a man who made it all
the way to the uppermost rung of the ladder, and then held
tenaciously when the support began to crumble and finally
went down in a descent to which history knows hardly any
precedent.
The question is: if Dick was so sagacious that—starting as
a delivery boy in his parents’ little neighborhood grocery
store, who gratefully thanked customers for a nickel tip, he
outsmarted Tom and Harry and everybody else and eventu-
ally saw a procession of kings and presidents seeking his
favors at the White House—how could he be also so unrea-
sonable as to perform in a way that made the majority of the
nation despise him, after all his achievements on the global
scene? How could he be so self-destructive as, having or-
dered a widespread net of spying, also to have installed bug-
ging devices to spy on himself? And if he wished to stand
194 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
great
before
posterity,
why
did
he
also
record
the
foul
words
with
which
his
language
abounded?
The
outraged
nation
follows,
all
enrapt, the
tale
of the
inanities
conceived
in
the
White House
by
the
President
or
his
agents
and executed
in
burglaries
and
other
acts
out of
a
cheap
spy
movie:
secret
rendezvous
of
conjurers plotting
on
park
benches,
in
hotel
lobbies
and
darkened
cars;
a
suitcase
of
hot
money
hidden
in
a
railway
station locker;
contra-
bandist
flights to
Mexico,
with
a
melodramatic
episode
thrown
in
of
a
faithful
secretary
who
tripped
over
a
tape
re-
corder,
causing
extensive
erasures.
In those
months,
the
President again
and
again faced
the
cameras and
assured
the
nation
that no
wrong
had
ever
been done
by
him
or
his
staff.
Why,
then,
did
he
not
destroy
the
incriminating
tapes
as
well?
When finally the roof of the White House was in effect
blown off, a man with a drooping chin descended from the
invisible throne of the Oval Office and; surrounded by his
household, spoke to the nation, sounding as if he were again
the grocery boy: he spoke of his saintly mother and of his
hardworking father. He still did not appreciate the bewitch-
ment of the mightiest man on earth, up to the day before,
going past the doorman and as a last gesture, as it appeared
to me, raising his arms in a victory signal before being lifted
by a helicopter from the lawn. It was no comedy; it was all
tragedy. Possibly in years to come a more penetrating trage-
dian—an Aeschylus, a Sophocles, a Euripides—will recognize
what it was in the man elected by the nation that triumphed
over him, and caused him to act irrationally. What was the
spell that outsmarted him, his logic and his cunning?
What is the answer to the riddle?
Whatever Nixon’s personal shortcomings, there is a factor
that needs to be considered, without which perspective is
A
CHRONICLE
OF
Our
TIME
195
lost.
It
was
lost
to
Nixon
himself,
but
this
is
in
the analytical
nature
of things:
a
man
does
not take
into
account
the
most
obvious
factors
when
he
tries
to
figure out
what dominates
him,
what
hits
him.
Entering the White House as President and as Com-
mander in Chief, Nixon was entrusted by the nation, even
by the entire Western world, with a detonator that could in-
cinerate the people of the globe. This trusteeship is a re-
sponsibility of thé President alone, twenty-four hours a day,
three hundred sixty-five days a year. An atomic attack pro-
vides a very short time for warning; listening devices are
positioned in the north, in case an attack comes over the
pole—the route is shorter and warning time is less—and in
other strategically placed stations in America and abroad,
and they are monitored every single second, incessantly. But
it is the President who has the fatal decision to make, possi-
bly on the spur of a moment. Stations encircling the poten-
tial enemy, in Europe, the Near East and Far East, have
their retributory missiles ready for instant command.
The President fulfills all kinds of official and ceremonial
functions and lives his family life as well. But whatever he
thinks or does, he must be cognizant of the trigger entrusted
to him, and of the siloes from which intercontinental atomic
warheads can be fired in retaliation in this balance of terror,
and of the atomic submarines stealthily cruising not far from
the coast. He cannot keep all this out of his mind, not even
in sleep, even if he is not consciously thinking of it.
A fateful power like this was never before vested in a
mortal. A reader of the gospel description of Gehenna,
where the sinners are thrown for damnation, should imagine
that he alone is entrusted with the key to that place harbor-
ing uncounted progeny of Adam. He can open the pit and
let the people out, or he can add more sulfur and fire; and
this reader, if he can visualize it, should also contemplate
196 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
how
this
preoccupation
would permanently dominate
his
ac-
tivities.
The fear of committing a mistake, an irreparable mistake,
the extreme strain—such as came into the open in the con-
frontation between Kennedy and Khrushchev in the days
of the Cuba ultimatum, or, to a lesser degree, in the days of
the alert following the Yom Kippur War—the gnawing feel-
ing of being inadequate to the task of guardian of human
destinies—all this never for a single moment leaves the trus-
tee of the cosmic power of destruction.
A sense of suspicion of everyone and even of oneself must
take hold of the human possessing the facility to terminate
history, at least the history of civilization. Irrational acts will
be committed, almost by compulsion. When papers were
stolen from the Pentagon and the theft was traced to an em-
ployee, who supplied them to the press and thus also to the
potential enemy, he could have been apprehended without
a burglary of his psychoanalyst’s office, a deed for which
Nixon took the responsibility but which he did not know
how to justify. And every other step showed fear and suspi-
cion: the actions directed from the White House under
Nixon have the stamp of a personality suffering simulta-
neously from the mania of grandeur and the mania of perse-
cution, two manias that usually go together. The grandeur
was not imaginary—it was intrinsic in the role; nor was sus-
picion out of place, if plans exist at this very hour to inciner-
ate instantly two hundred major American cities. But the
suspicion contorted judgment and the Watergate scandal
resulted—possibly because Nixon was more perceptive than
Johnson before him or Ford after him.
A basic fact needs to be recontemplated: being descend-
ants of the survivors of great paroxysms of nature of the
past, we are possessed by the urge inherited through racial
memory to repeat the violent performance. The brain cells
of the man in the position to call down the cataclysm must
A CHRONICLE OF OuR TIME 197
be like over-taut strings, intoning in his consciousness a
strange tune.
The danger of the President’s possible mental derange-
ment before his exit was sensed by the responsible func-
tionaries of the Defense Department, and as newspapers re-
ported, the Defense Secretary made secret temporary
arrangements to preclude the President’s exit coinciding
with ruin by the pressing of the button. Did not the first
Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, in 1949, with the but-
ton there at his finger and with Soviet Russia not yet
possessing a comparable nuclear arsenal, run out one early
morning hour into the street of a Florida resort crying in
panic that the Russians had invaded the United States of
America? He was a man of exceptional abilities. The her-
itage of racial fears, the Freudian urge to re-create the
traumatic experience of the past, the unconscious Prome-
thean struggle betweenthe urge for destruction and the urge
for survival—and James Forrestal hurled himself from the
window of a high-rise military hospital, to find peace with
himself.
Lyndon Johnson, whose motto was, “Let us sit down and
reason together,” misled Congress and the nation by staging
the Tonkin Bay incident and then vastly increasing the in-
volvement in Vietnam. He sent nearly five hundred thou-
sand young Americans to a country in which the United
States had hardly an economic or political interest, the very
name of which was unknown from the school days of those
sent there to kill and be killed, to maim and be maimed, to
burn out with napalm the fifteen-year-old Vietcong draftees,
and themselves to be drowned in swamps and lost in forests
they defoliated. Johnson mortgaged the next generation’s
wealth to pay for this agony, actually a surrogate for the
great atomic carnage.
Atomic weapons carry a danger of radioactive fallout; but
amassed and before they are ever used, they carry a
198 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
different
kind
of
fallout—a
disturbance
in
the brain
cells
of
the
person
responsible
for their
use
or
nonuse,
who
has
the
fuse
always
with
him
along with
a
not
easily
controllable
urge
to
light
it.
Extricated from this responsibility, divested of his power,
Nixon raised his arms as in a victory signal—but he did not
-know what he greeted with the gesture.
In San Clemente, in the walled-in Casa Pacifica, the for-
mer President wrote his memoirs. He did not know the true
line of his defense. So he repeated the blunders of a pris-
oner-exile on St. Helena of a hundred and fifty years ago,
who, after having plunged Europe into bloody wars with
horse-drawn cannons, wrote a story of his life as he saw it,
or as he dreamed it up, much of which the historians con-
sider untrue.
THE THREE GIANTS.
The three giants of our time—the United States, Soviet
Russia, and communist China, though unequal in technol-
ogy and population, dominate the world and threaten its
survival. They emerged to their present positions only in this
century, actually following World War II. Despite many
wars in the last thirty-five years these three have escaped,
till now, an all-out confrontation among themselves.
At the end of World War II, America was already in pos-
session of atomic weapons, Russia not yet; and when Ger-
many .and Japan were defeated, relations between the
Americans and the Russians became strained, some geopoli-
ticians in Washington recognizing that the world domina-
tion attempted by Hitlerian Germany would soon be the
goal of the Soviet state. They felt that with the Russians
earlier or later acquiring the skill to produce atomic weap-
ons, the potential threat of Russia to America and the rest of

itself
when

The Einsteinian formula—energy equals mass multiplied
by the velocity of light (in vacuum) squared; Lisa Meitner’s
secret, carried by this Jewess fleeing Nazi Germany; the al-
chemist act on the campus of the University of Chicago,
performed by Enrico Fermi, who had left fascist Italy for
the United States; the great explosion over the New Mexico
desert, a work of many, orchestrated by Robert Oppen-
heimer; and then, the blinding light over crumbling Japan
when the Americans had already repossessed the Pacific
strongholds and the Russians belatedly entered theswar in
the Pacific.
Einstein’s verbal reaction was as short as his formula:
“Oh, veh!”—a centuries-old Yiddish cry or whisper.
Oppenheimer, who had headed the team that built the
atomic missiles dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and on
Bikini Atoll, the latter free of men but not of animal life,
grew remorseful. The Russians were already much advanced
in developing atomic bombs. Edward Teller, who left his
native Hungary before the Nazis’ onslaught, was at the head
of the campaign to develop thermonuclear weapons, and, re-
alizing that the Soviet Union would also develop them, al-
most single-handedly carried the project through, despite
the vehement protests of the vast majority of nuclear physi-
cists, headed by Oppenheimer, as well as the bulk of the
scientific establishment.

China went through the expulsion of the Japanese army,
the “long march,” internal rift, the flight of the Kuomintang
to Formosa, the exile and annihilation of the kulak farmers
and the structuring of a monolithic state under Mao, a disci-
ple of Stalin, now in rift with the Soviet communists.
In the materialistic regime Mao became supreme: his
work, wisdom itself; his body, in his rare swims across the
Yangtze River, holy to perceive and divine to touch. Con-
fucius was thrown from his pedestal into the dust, his teach-
ings outlawed.
Stalin, torturer and killer of millions, who spoke Russian
in a heavy Caucasian accent, who started as a seminarist in
a theological service in Tiflis, who when in power closed
churches and made Stalin-worship—‘“Stalin, our sun’—a reli-
gion of the state, was not free of fears and remorse. Some
nights he would drive to the cemetery in the yard of the
Nove Devitze Monastery on the outskirts of Moscow to
kneel at the grave of Aliluyeva, his wife who took her own
life, leaving him a daughter, his only child.
A CHRONICLE OF Our TIME 201
Tortured by fear and suspicions, his death in his own bed
saved the group of doctors whom he had accused of plotting
to poison him.
The Soviet Union, having Bfiriatically preceded the
United States in space travel—Khrushchev with his broad
grin at the Americans for sending an orange-size, minuscule
probe, while the Russians were sending heavy, two-ton ones
—felt that the time had come to bring atomic offensive
power as close to American shores as the Americans had in
Turkey to the Russian border. The Cuban confrontation fol-
lowed, and, risking an atomic war, Kennedy made Kosygin
back down and remove the offending weapons.
China had not yet developed anything comparable to the
Russian atomic arsenal. Mao and Chou En-lai turned China
and its cities into an underground net of passages built to
serve as shelters when the inevitable war with Russia would
take place, with Russia attacking with atomic weapons.
China prepared to lose several hundred million people out
of its eight hundred million, but determined to survive and
invade and take over Siberia, which is almost empty of pop-
ulation, as otherwise China is doomed to starve, with its
population pressing against deserts and unproductive lands.
As of today a million Russian soldiers occupy positions along
the Russian—Chinese frontier, the Amur River.
I will interrupt this narrative. I let the story develop with-

other psychoanalytic hour. Yet pausing at this point I ask
the reader, what would he make of the following?
The five-pointed star—the ancient symbol of the planet
Venus—adorns the headgear of every American, Soviet, and
Chinese soldier.
202 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
GUYANA MASS SUICIDE
On November
20,
1978,
newspaper
headlines
madeknown
the
mass
suicide of
the
cultists
of the so-called
Peo-
ple’s
Temple,
led
by
Reverend
Jim
Jones.
The
initial
figure
of
nearly
three
hundred
suicides
grew
in
daily
dispatches
from Jonestown,
Guyana,
as
more and more
corpses
were
discovered,
to
more
than
nine
hundred.
The
cultists
had
fol-
lowed
Jones,
their
undisputed
leader,
first
from Indiana
to
California,
then
to
Guyana,
there
to
die
in
a
ceremony
in
which
over three
hundred
children
were
also sacrificed,
given poison
to
drink.
In the
orgy
of
human
destruction,
death was
not
all
self-inflicted:
many
were
shot
by
other
cultists.
Psychologists and sociologists had little to offer in efforts
to explain what had taken place. The cultists lived under the
spell of the personality of a man who had some ideas of so-
cial reform; he amassed a fortune in the millions by making
his followers transfer to the commune chest, of which he
was the sole dispenser, their possessions, in some cases sell-
ing their homes. He demanded complete submission to his
will: some of his abusive sexual practices—such as perform-
ing a homosexual act on a male member of the cult in the
presence of women—were described by those few who sur-
vived self-annihilation. He acted also as if he were an incar-
nation of Jesus. He was suffering paranoia—that much the
psychglogists could tell—but what was at the source of this
disruption of personality, and what lay in the deeper strata
of the psyche of the cultists who were attracted to him,
some of them from highly cultured backgrounds? What
made them follow him into the jungles of Guyana, one day
to extinguish their lives, leaving their bodies, with children,
even infants, spread mostly face down, dressed, some hold-

ing
their
arms
around
others,
in
groups,
but
also
some
alone,
stopped
in
apparent
efforts
to
run
into
the
jungle?
There
must have been
a
panic,
engendered
by
the
panic
in their
leader.
Beyond
this
nothing
could
be
offered
in
explanation,
but
this
explanation required
no
degree
in
psychology.
It
was obvious
to
all
who
saw
the
scene,
if
only
in
newspapers
or
on
television,
and
certainly
to
all
who
visited
the
site
in
the
jungle.
Before a fortnight passed, paperbacks were feeding but
leaving unsatisfied the curiosity of those who wished to un-
derstand, possibly fearing to find in themselves something of
the same urge. I admit to having read, very cursorily, the
news releases with their evaluations. My daughter, Ruth V.
Sharon, a psychoanalyst, brought me a photograph pub-
lished in the newspapers of Jones’s “throne.” What made
her give me this picture was a sign in large letters behind
the throne. It read: “hose who do not remember the past
are condemned to repeat it.” This sentence originated with
the Harvard philosopher George Santayana, and I used to
quote it before my audiences on the college campuses, usu-
ally concluding the terminal section of a lecture—the section
regularly dedicated to the theme of mankind in amnesia.
Jones was living in terror, and this terror he also partly
conveyed to those who followed him. The social reforms, the
oriental despotism, the hoarding of money, the persecution
complex, the sexual malpractices, all were efforts to bring to
the surface something that was not given to release. If he
could he would have plunged all the living to their deaths.
To contribute to the understanding, a fathom deeper, of
the agony of the false messiah of the Guyana jungles, and of
his human herd, I will quote from a book, The Pursuit of the
Millennium, by Norman Cohn, published in 1957. Several
years ago a reader of mine, Cathy Guido of Binghamton,
N.Y., then a student, by now a lawyer, copied page 144 from
this book in the belief it might interest me. It tells of a sect
204 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
founded by Konrad Schmid, who lived in the fifteenth cen-
tury in Germany:
In order to be received into the sect a would-be member
had to make a general confession to Schmid, undergo flagel-
lation at his hands and take an oath of absolute obedience to
him. From that moment onwards the only obligation which
he recognised was total submission to the messiah. Schmid
taught his followers that their salvation depended upon
their attitude toward himself. If they were not “as soft and
yielding as silk” in his hands, if they showed the slightest
striving after independence, they would be handed over to
the Devil to be tortured both physically and mentally. He
was their god and they must pray to him, addressing him as
“Our Father.”
Those who read of Jones’s way of. introducing new
members into his cult cannot miss finding similarities. The
continuation, again, shows Jones’s precursor acting as a mes-
siah, who had precursors himself:
“Those who were faithful to Schmid had their reward.
They could rejoice in the certain knowledge that in and
through them human history was attaining its true end.” So
we anticipate some roots or affiliation with earlier figures
and practices. The followers of Schmid considered “. . . the
flagellants of 1349 as standing in the same relationship to
them as John the Baptist to Christ. Indeed Christ himself
was no more than their precursor; for, granted that he had
pointed the true way to salvation by enduring flagellation; it
was only those who beat themselves who could claim to
pursue that way to the end.” And “. . . just as Christ had
changed water into wine, so they had replaced baptism with
water by baptism with blood. God had indeed kept the best
wine for last—it was nothing else than the blood shed by the
flagellants.”
A CHRONICLE OF OuR TIME 205
The following sentence carries the story, unknowingly to
its author, another fathom deeper and closer to its historical
genesis, because the author of The Pursuit of the Millen-
nium next says of the adherents of Schmid’s sect:
These people were convinced that as they beat themselves
an angel named—surprisingly—Venus watched over them.
Their skins all red with blood seemed garments for a wed-
ding-feast, the skirts which they wore during flagellation
they called robes of innocence.
What Norman Cohn apparently regarded as unexplaina-
ble and termed “surprising” is not surprising to the readers
of Worlds in Collision. What appears unreasoned is not so at
all.
Over the brooding Jones, and over the command to swal-
low cyanide, was also a star of disaster, unexplained and
unexplored. The human herd was stricken by a panic with
which the leader infected them, but to which an ancient ter-
ror added its impetus.
LIVING BY THE BOMB
On the last of May, 1978, when newspapers in the United
States as well as abroad featured graduation ceremonies on
college campuses, and at the same time a United Nations
special session on disarmament, leaderless and _ listless,
dragged out the hopeless issue—not even of disarmament
but only of limitation of armament—a citizen, L. C. Bohn,
published a letter in the New York Times. I reproduce this
letter:
If it does nothing else, the U.N. special session on disar-
mament should remind us what an artificial and precarious
world we have made for our children.

and perhaps
to

But
the
sorry
fact
is
that
the
world we
are
offering these
shiny

teeters
on
the
edge
of
catastrophe.
Thechance
of
nuclear
war
in
any
week
or
month
or
year
is
tiny.
But
no
one
can
live
a
life
in
a
year.
Most
of
those
who
have
thought
about
the
facts
agree
that
over
a
period
of
20,
30,
or
40
years
the
odds
favor
all-out
nuclear
war.
By the mad choice of some future Hitler, by mischief at
lower levels or in some nuclear-armed Sarajevo, by escala-
tion of conflict in Africa or the Mideast, or by sheer acci-
dent, the real future of the new generation is more than
likely to be death in war, or dismal struggle in the aftermath
of war. Which of our children is prepared for this? How
many are planning careers devoted to improving the chance
for peace? Which of them is ready to live out his days
maimed, burned, irradiated, or blinded? Which knows how
to grow food in the wilderness or survive in irradiated rub-
ble? How many have the equipment or skill to tell if water
or soil or crops or rusty food cans are safe, or can be made
so? Which is ready to move away (to where?) or to dig a
hole and live in it, perhaps for months or years; or to diag-
nose a fever or heal an open wound in his wife or baby?
Which of them is ready to organize his fellow survivors for a
new start at civilization—or to sink to the life of a savage,
preying on his fellow beings and being preyed on by them.
. Im the absence of thoroughgoing nuclear disarmament, to
assume a future of peace is obviously naive and unrealistic.
As things are now, nuclear war is likely to be the event of
the age, that shapes the lives of our children to the core.
But we hardly treat it as a core problem. Two-thirds of
the people now alive have never known a world without nu-
clear threat. The very concept of a world without poised nu-
clear missiles and warheads grows dimmer each decade.

Nuclear terror—nuclear deterrence—means living by the
bomb. Perhaps it will be only just if our generation, which
has chosen that path, also dies by the bomb. But our
children?
I reread the passage starting with the words “As I see it,
we have a choice. We can be ‘hit’ psychologically and
stirred to our cores. . . .” Am I not too late? Do I prepare
here a postmortem diagnosis, or a warning in time?
I remember the months and weeks before World War I
started. I remember also the months and weeks before
World War II started. Once more, familiar sentences, identi-
cal words, the same throbbing in a few tuned to apprehend
the approaching disaster, and the same apparent insensi-
tivity in the great majority of their contemporaries. I have
already reached four score and three. My most unpopular
message I have kept too long within me. The psychological
“hit,” when delivered, needs time to “stir our cores.” In
the analytical vocabulary a psychological time fuse is called,
depending on the form it takes, resistance or projection, and
if it is carried on too long or it protests something too impor-
tant, it may degenerate into the splitting of the personality
208 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
or depersonalization. Resistance can take innumerable
forms: it can manifest itself in an inability of com-
