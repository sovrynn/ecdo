POETS AND VISIONARIES
In later ages, in different places and cultures, there ap-
pears a visionary, a poet: suddenly, it is as if a door
opens before him, with a light shining through, and he
sees the past.
SHAKESPEARE, THREE GENERATIONS
AFTER COPERNICUS
On February 17, 1600, Giordano Bruno was burned at the
stake in Rome. Before he died for his theological and astro-
nomical heresies, he spent seven years in the prison of the
Holy Inquisition in Venice and Rome. And before that he
spent time in England trying to convince the great of the
Elizabethan kingdom of the truth of the Copernican con-
cept of the Sun, not Earth, in the center of the planetary
system. This was before Galileo embraced the Copernican
doctrine. Bruno, though a philosopher and not an astrono-
mer, was in advance of his time: he saw in fixed stars other
suns around which planets revolve, a view that made him an
abhorrence to Kepler and Galileo. In England he did not
succeed in promulgating the simple Copernican system—
neither Shakespeare nor Bacon was swayed by his efforts,
but steadfastly adhered to the Aristotelian system with the

Only
William

be-

convinced,
whether
through
Bruno’s
efforts
or
his
own,
of the truth of the
Copernican
system
and,
through
experi-
ments,
realized
that
the
Earth
is
a

He
devised
a

Bacon,
the
philosopher,
is
credited
with
introducing
the principle
of
experiment and
observation
in scientific
mat-
ters,
instead
of reliance
on
the
word
of authorities,
usually
ancient;
but
he
was
amused
by
Gilbert’s
experiments and
de-
cried
them.
The fear of living on a moving planet must have been the
basis for the rejection of the concept of a rotating Earth by
Shakespeare, Bacon, and other great intellects of the age.
Moving, Earth could come to a mishap; fixed, it is safely se-
cured. In various of his works Shakespeare subscribed to the
pre-Copernican system. In his innermost being, however, the
poet must have known the reason this had to be palpably
wrong: if Earth neither moves around the Sun nor rotates
on its axis, then the spheres must be carried daily around
the Earth at velocities for which nothing comparable was
known on Earth.

But when the planets
In evil mixture, to disorder wander,
What plagues, and what portents, what mutiny,
What of raging of the sea, shaking of the earth,
Commotion of the winds, frights, changes, horrors,
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate. .. .
(Troilus and Cressida, Act 1)
Discord in nature is followed by a similar “oppugnancy”
in human beings:

The racial memory rises from its submerged ward:

swell the curled waters bove the main, that things might
change or cease ... [and he asks that the] all-shaking
thunder, smite flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world!
(King Lear, Act III)
The bard asks through the mouth of one of his characters:
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm?
. . . But never till to-night, never till now
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven;
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.
(Julius Caesar, Act 1)
A phantasmagoria in Horatio’s mind (Hamlet) reawakens
some ancient vision. The never-extinguished terror flamed
up when an unusually bright comet appeared soon after
Caesar’s death, and the world awaited doomsday.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead

THE SHADOW OF DEATH
Visions of the world on a collision course with a flaming
body growing ever larger and more menacing, or phantas-
magorias of celestial battle, all to some degree remindful of
the events witnessed by overawed humanity about to be
decimated—such visions reappeared in revelations of per-
sons in ecstasy, in poetry of exalted lyricists, in dreams and
nightmares of ordinary men. The high waves rising pre-
cipitously and then crashing down; the all-leveling earth-
shocks; the fire rain descending from space; the flaming
mountains, bursting when swept by continent-invading
tides; the waves carrying the fragments to other mountain
barriers, themselves just sprung from the plains—these and
related visions are almost a repertoire of man’s unconscious
mind. Fhey rise occasionally to the level of the subconscious
and from there into the domain of poetical clairvoyance or,
as the case may be, into the nightmares of human beings
who awaken in a cold sweat.
Recognizing in so many instances an unmasked reflection
of events witnessed by overawed ancestors, events many of
which go back to the convulsion of nature thirty-four cen-

Ancient Mexican traditions preserved in sacred services
speak of the profound gloom that for a quarter of a century
enveloped the Western continent, and I repeat here one
summarizing quote by Charles Etienne Brasseur, the nine-
teenth-century explorer and archaeologist: “A vast night
reigned over all the American land, of which tradition
speaks unanimously: in a sense the sun no longer existed for
this ruined world which was lighted up at intervals only by
frightful conflagrations, revealing the full horror of their sit-
uation to the small number of human beings that escaped
from these calamities.”! In the section “Shadow of Death”
(Worlds in Collision, pp. 126-34) I quoted traditions writ-
ten in other ancient languages about the time the sky was
shattered, the day became dark and stayed dark through
decades, and Earth teemed with noxious creatures.
The generation of the Shadow of Death almost entirely
succumbed, and its progeny emerged into the extended
traumatic experience of a dying world—in Iceland the tradi-
tion is that in the somber Fimbul—Winter only one human
pair survived. All this must have been stored in an un-

storehouse
ofthe

A
friend,
knowing
of
my
search,
sent
me
this
poem
of
Lord
Byron,
Darkness:
I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings—the huts,
The habitations of all things which dwell,
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,
And men were gathered round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other’s face;
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:
A fearful hope was all the World contained;
Forests were set on fire—but hour by hour
They fell and faded—and the crackling trunks
Extinguished with a crash—and all was black.
The brows of men by the despairing light
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed
Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up
With mad disquietude on the dull sky,
The pall of a past World; and then again
With curses cast them down upon the dust,
PoETs AND VISIONARIES 123
And
gnashed
their
teeth
and howled:
the
wild
birds
shrieked,
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
And flap their useless wings, the wildest brutes
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled
And twined themselves among the multitude,
Hissing. .. .
. . no Love was left;
All earth was but one thought—and that was Death,
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
Of famine fed upon all entrails—men
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
The meagre by the meagre were devoured,
. . . The World was void...
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless—
A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay... .
This fantasy of Byron was not born by fiat of the poet,
drawing his creative elixir out of a void, bringing into being
figures and situations invented by him and familiar to no-
body else.
Details of the poem, like the reference to the volcanoes
blazing in the darkness, or creatures taking over the sud-
denly depopulated and impoverished world, or the flocks of
the terrified wild birds that fluttered on the ground while
the world was in pangs of hunger and despair, seem to echo
some ancient impressions. Byron showed no awareness of
the similarity in his poem to conditions at the time of the
Exodus and the wandering in the desert, when he spread
before his readers this picture of a world coming to an end.
But this is how the survivors of the initial shock—devastat-
ing as it was—must have viewed their existence in a world
expiring and not to be resurrected: was not some real hap-
pening buried in the human soul for over thirty centuries in
124 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
this grim picture of the flocks of birds fluttering helplessly
on the ground among famished wanderers in a land whirling
in ashes?
In Earth in Upheaval I tried to bring back to light the
effect of changed ecology on the animal kingdom, even
where man was not present to absorb the impressions. I
painted the scene as I saw it™in the evidence presented by
stones and bones:
. . . In changed surroundings, amid climatic vicissitudes,
with pastures withered, with plants that had served as food
or animals that had served as prey gone, these few followed
the rest in a losing battle for existence, surrendering at last
in the struggle for survival of a species.
Burning forests, trespassing seas, erupting volcanoes, sub-
merging lands took the major toll; impoverished fields and
burned-down forests did not offer favorable conditions for
frightened and solitary survivors, and claimed their own
share in the work of extinction.
Lord Byron did not write an eschatological picture of a
dying world of the future, as he thought he did: he drew
from a common spring of all men, even of all the animal
kingdom.
NEVERMORE
Edgar Allan Poe wrote a short tale, “The Conversation of
Eiros and Charmion.” Upon ending his earthly life, Eiros
has just arrived in the Beyond and is greeted there by Char-
mion: they knew each other when on Earth. Charmion, for a
number of years a denizen of the Land of Bliss (“Aidenn”),
says:
“I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stu-
pendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. . .
POETS AND VISIONARIES 125
of the
world
which
has
so
fearfully
perished.
.
.
.
When,
coming
out
from
among
mankind,
I
passed
into
Night
through
the
Grave—at
that
period,
if
I
remember
aright,
the
calamity
which
overwhelmed
you
was
utterly
unanticipated.
But,
indeed,
I
knew
little
of
the
speculative
philosophy
of
the
day.”
Eiros replies:
“The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unan-
ticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a sub-
ject of discussion with astronomers. I need scarce tell you,
my friend, that even when you left us, men had agreed to
understand those passages in the most holy writings which
speak of the final destruction of all things by fire, as having
reference to the orb of the earth alone. But in regard to the
immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault
from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the
comets were divested of the terrors of flame. The very mod-
erate density of these bodies had been well established.
They had been observed to pass among the satellites of
Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration ei-
ther in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary
planets. We had long regarded the wanderers as vapory cre-
ations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable
of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of
contact. But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the
elements of all the comets were accurately known. That
among them we should look for the agency of the threat-
ened fiery destruction had been for many years considered
an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had
been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind; and al-
though it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual ap-
prehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astrono-
mers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally
received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.
“The elements of the strange orb were immediately calcu-
126 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
lated, and it was at once conceded by all observers, that its
path, at perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity
with the earth. There were two or three astronomers, of sec-
ondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact was
inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the effect of
this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they
would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long
employed among worldly considerations, could not in any
manner grasp. But the truth of a vitally important fact soon
makes its way into the understanding of even the most
stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied
not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was not, at
first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very unu-
sual character. It was of a dull red, and had little percep-
tible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material in-
crease in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration
in its color. Meanwhile the ordinary affairs of men were dis-
carded, and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion,
instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary na-
ture. Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capac-
ities to such considerations. The learned now gave their in-
tellect—their soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear,
or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they
panted for right views. They groaned for perfected knowl-
edge. Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceed-
ing majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored.
’“That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants
would result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion
which ‘hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise
were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy
of the crowd. It was demonstrated, that the density of the
comet's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and
the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites
of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an ear-
PoETS AND VISIONARIES 127
nestness
fear-enkindled,
dwelt
upon
the
biblical
prophe-
cies,
and
expounded
them
to
the
people
with
a
directness
and
simplicity
of
which
no
previous
instance
had been
known.
That
the
final
destruction
of the earth
must
be
brought
about
by
the
agency
of
fire,
was
urged
with
a
spirit
that
enforced
everywhere
conviction;
and
that
comets were
of no
fiery
nature
(as
all
men now
knew)
was
a
truth
which
relieved
all,
in
a
great
measure, from
the
apprehension
of
the great
calamity
foretold.
It
is
noticeable
that
the
popularprejudices
and
vulgar
errors in
regard
to
pestilences
and
wars—errors
which
were
wont
to
prevail
upon
every appear-
ance
of
a
comet—were
now
altogether
unknown.
As
if
by
some sudden
convulsive
exertion,
reason
had
at
once
hurled
superstition
from
her
throne.
The
feeblest
intellect
had
derived
vigor
from
excessive
interest.
“What minor evils might arise from the contact were
points of elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight
geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate,
and consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and
electric influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible
effect would in any manner be produced. While such discus-
sions were going on, their subject gradually approached,
growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant
luster. Mankind grew paler as it came. All human operations
were suspended.
“There was an epoch in the course of the general senti-
ment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpass-
ing that of any previously recorded visitation. The people
now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers
were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. The chi-
merical aspect of their terror was gone. The hearts of the
stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms. A
very few days sufficed, however, to merge even such feelings
in sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply
to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its historical
128 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
attributes
had
disappeared.
It
oppressed
us
with
a
hideousnovelty
of
emotion.
We
saw
it
not
as
an
astronomical
phe-
nomenon
in
the
heavens, but
as
an
incubus
upon
our hearts,
and
a
shadow
upon
our
brains.
It
had
taken,
with
incon-
ceivable
rapidity,
the
character
of
a
gigantic
mantle
of
rare
flame,
extending from
horizon
to
horizon.
“Yet
a
day,
and
men
breathed
with
greater
freedom.
It
was
clear
that
we were already within
the
influence of the
comet;
yet
we
lived.
We
even
felt
an
unusual
elasticity
of
frame and
vivacity of
mind.
The
exceeding
tenuity
of the
object
of
our
dread
was apparent;
for
all
heavenly
objects
were
plainly
visible
through
it.
Meantime,
our
vegetation
had
perceptibly
altered;
and we gained
faith,
from
this
pre-
dicted
circumstance,
in
the foresight of the
wise.
A
wild
lux-
uriance
of
foliage,
utterly
unknown
before, burst out
upon
every
vegetable
thing.
“Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon
us. It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us.
A wild change had come over all men; and the first sense of
pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror.
The first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the
breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. It
could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically
affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possi-
ble modifications to which it might be subjected, were now
the topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an
electric thrill of the intensest horror through the universal
heart of man.
*
“Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained
frenzy of mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had
previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the
bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous character we
clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a
POETS AND VISIONARIES 129
day
again
passed,
bearing
away
with
it
the
last
shadow
of
Hope.
We
gasped
in
the
rapid modification
of the
air.
The
red
blood
bounded
tumultuously through
its
strict
channels.
A
furious
delirium possessed
all
men;
and,
with
arms
rigidly
outstretched
toward
the
threatening heavens, they
trembled
and
shrieked
aloud.
But
the
nucleus
of the
destroyer was
now
upon
us:
even here
in
Aidenn,
I
shudder
while
I speak.
Let
me
be
brief—brief
as
the
ruin that
overwhelmed.
For
a
moment
there
was
a
wild
lurid
light
alone,
visiting
and
pen-
etrating
all
things.
Then—let
us
bow
down, Charmion,
be-
fore
the
excessive
majesty
of the great
God!—then,
there
came
a
shouting
and pervading
sound,
as
if
from
the
mouth
itself
of
HIM;
while
the
whole
incumbent
mass
of
ether
in
which
we
existed,
burst
at
once
into
a
species of intense
flame,
for
whose
surpassing
brilliancy
and
all-fervid
heat
even
the
angels
in
the
high
Heaven
of
pure
knowledge
have
no
name.
Thus ended
all.”
The description of a collision of the Earth with a wander-
ing comet, found in Laplace, could not have served Poe as a
sole model. Laplace limited his description to physical phe-
nomena and consequences; Poe, however, to visual and au-
ditory sensations, but mainly to the mental anguish of hu-
manity in the face of the approaching terminal event.
Certain facts are mentioned which could not have been
deduced from the sum of scientific knowledge of Poe’s time,
almost three score years before the observations (1900) of
the Dutch botanist, Hugo deVries, on the evening primrose,
given to spontaneous but very rudimentary mutations.
Poe’s astronomers’ arguments must strike the reader who
is aware of the debate of the 1950s (evoked not at the ap-
pearance of a comet but at the appearance of a book) as fa-
miliar: comets are bodies without substance; none was seen
to disturb any of the Jovian satellites while passing through
130
MANKIND
IN
AMNESIA
the
system,
and
the
like.
Thus
one
might
be
tempted
to
claim
a
certain
prescience
in
the
poet,
although
a
search
in
literature
would show
that
astronomers
of
the time
em-
ployed
the
very
same
arguments
to
alleviate fearful
expecta-
tions
at
the
approach
of
spectacular
comets. This
may
ra-
tionally
explain
some
of the
elements
of Poe’s
story,
but
not
all
of
them.
The anguish set forth by Poe impresses as a heritage of an
extinct generation, or, better, of extinct generations—a trust
unrecognized but real and troubling deep inside, under the
muffling layer of the conscious mind, the scientist’s as well
as the layman’s. With poetic clairvoyance, Poe temporarily
peeled off the muffling strata, and the agony was all there,
with its horror welling up and ebbing in crescendo and
diminuendo, finally blazing out in a brilliance known to
modern man only since the atomic explosion in the desert of
Los Alamos.
Poe sensed the hidden anxiety of our race when he looked
on the dissolution of life on Earth as already having hap-
pened. The Land of Shades—our terrestrial existence—is left
behind: all is ended. Nor does any record exist of what
might have befallen the dwellers on other planets that du-
tifully roll around the Sun on regular, if changed, paths.
Nothing reveals that those planets might have nurtured ad-
vanced life before the dissolution into elements spelled out a
“Nevermore.”
* MIND AT THE END OF ITS TETHER
Jules Verne (1828-1905) was a new type of prophet—
nothing of his compatriot Nostradamus who preceded him
by three hundred years; nothing of mysticism—all frivolous
fantasy of science fiction. He described some of the adven-
turous enterprises of our age; and in the case of man’s travel
PoETs AND VISIONARIES 131
to the Moon, in an uncanny fashion, one hundred years be-
fore Apollo 11, he invented some details that became reality
in the 1969 mission. But when he reached the age of sixty
his spring dried up and his mantle was snatched by H. G.
Wells.
In The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds and In the
Days of the Comet, Wells mixed science fiction with social
fiction, and his exuberant optimism carried him and his
readers to think that man’s limits were not even the sky. He
also composed his famous short history of the world and was
preeminent among those who, though atheists or anti-
clerics, saw man’s future as bright and worth improving, and
life as a time for enjoyment. However, I am not knowl-
edgeable enough about Wells to discuss him as a philoso-
pher. As a prophet of technological progress, though con-
stantly brimming with optimism, he was not always up to
the fantastic advances that waited in store: in 1907, in an ar-
ticle on “Modes of Transportation in the 2zoth Century,” he
asserted that aeronautics would never become a means of
mass transportation. The breakneck pace of discoveries and
inventions that made this century, when compared with the
last, appear as if from another world epoch, surpassed the
imagination of science fiction writers. But then in the first
week of August, 1945, mushroom clouds above two cities in
faraway islands were handwriting in the sky proclaiming the
apple from the tree of knowledge to be a fruit of Sodom.
Before that event came to be, a world frenzied in destruc-
tion for six years struggled over the Teutonic Millennium.
Wells sat in London, paying scant attention to the bombs
falling around, contemplating his by now numerous infirmi-
ties, and writing Mind at the End of Its Tether. The atomic
age had not yet arrived. But it must have been terror in-
herited from ancestors, never before breaking to the surface
in him, or else a vision of a pregnant future, an eschatology,
focused on the nearest future, that turned a lifelong
132 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
preacher
of
hedonism
and
pleasure
into
a

“The writer,” so he started, “finds very considerable rea-
son for believing that, within a period to be estimated by
weeks and months rather than by aeons, there has been a
fundamental change in the conditions under which life, not
simply human life, but all self-conscious existence, has been
going on since its beginning. This is a very startling persua-
sion to find establishing itself in one’s mind, and he puts for-
ward his conclusions in the certainty that they will be en-
tirely unacceptable to the ordinary rational man.”
He continued, speaking of himself in the third person: “If
his thinking has been sound, then this world is at the end of
its tether. The end of everything we call life is close at hand
and cannot be evaded. He is telling you the conclusions to
which reality has driven his own mind, and he thinks you
may be interested enough to consider them, but he is not at-
tempting to impose them upon you. He will do his best to
indicate why he has succumbed to so stupendous a proposi-
tion. . . . He writes under the urgency of a scientific train-
ing, which obliged him to clarify |his mind and his words to
the utmost limit of his capacity.”
It cannot be said that in pages to follow Wells made any-
thing that could be counted as a scientific argument, or
presented proof from nature or history, or a secret of war
making. It is not what it is claimed to be—it is a vision of a
visionary, seeing the future or knowing the hidden past.
“It requires an immense and concentrated effort of reali-
sation, “demanding constant reminders and refreshment, on
the part of a normal intelligence, to perceive that the cosmic
movement of events is increasingly adverse to the mental
make-up of our everyday life. It is a realization the writer
finds extremely difficult to sustain. But while he holds it, the
significance of Mind fades. The secular process loses its ac-
customed appearance of a mental order.”
POETS AND VISIONARIES 133
After explaining what he meant by the term “secular” as
referring to eternity, Wells proceeds, always referring to
himself as “he”:
“The secular process, as he now sees it, is entirely at one
with such non-mental rhythms as the accumulation of cris-
talline matter in a mineral vein or with the flight of a shower
of meteors. The two processes have run parallel for what we
call Eternity, and now abruptly they swing off at a tangent
from one another—just as a comet at its perihelion hangs
portentous in the heavens for a season and then rushes away
for ages or forever. Man’s mind accepted the secular process
as rational and it could not do otherwise, because he was
evolved as part and parcel of it.”
But how is it that Wells brings in as metaphor a shower of
meteors and a portentous comet in the sky? Is not the simile
here more than a simile?
In all his doomsday oration, Wells not even once put sus-
picion on man and man’s action. Nature changed its flow
and life is sentenced to extinction.
“The reality glares coldly and harshly upon any of those
who can wrench their minds from the comforting delusions
of normalcy to face the unsparing question that has over-
whelmed the writer. They discover a frightful queerness has
come into life. Even quite unobservant people now are be-
traying, by fits and starts, a certain wonder, a shrinking and
fugitive sense that something is happening so that life will
never be quite the same again.”
Wells turns to the reader and admonishes him: “Spread
out and examine the pattern of events, and you will find
yourself face to face with a new scheme of being, hitherto
unimaginable by the human mind. This new cold glare
mocks and dazzles the human intelligence, and yet, such is
the obstinate vitality of the philosophical urge in minds of
that insatiable quality, that they can still, under its cold ur-
gency, seek some way out or round or through the impasse.
134 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
The
writer
is
convinced
that
there
is
no
way
out
or
round
or
through
the
impasse.
It
is
the
end.”
Wells
soon
returns
to
similes of
which
the
true
sig-
nificance
is
most
suspicious:
“Hitherto
events
had been
held
together
by
a
certain
logi-
cal
consistency,
as
the
heavenly
bodies
as
we
know
them
have been
held
together
by
the
pull,
the
golden
cord, of
Gravitation.
Now
it
is as
if
that
cord
had vanished and
ev-
erything was driving
anyhow
to
anywhere
at
a
steadily
in-
creasing
velocity.
“The limit to the orderly secular development of life had
seemed to be a definitely fixed one, so that it was possible to
sketch out the pattern of things to come. But that limit was
reached and passed into a hitherto incredible chaos. . . .
“Events now follow one another in an entirely untrust-
worthy sequence. No one knows what tomorrow will bring
forth, but no one but a modern scientific philosopher can ac-
cept this untrustworthiness fully. . . . He knows, but the
multitude is not disposed to know and so it will never
know.”
Never? If the cosmos approaches chaos and the laws of
nature are soon to be terminated, there could be no secret
for any length of time. But in the meantime—
“In that invincible ignorance of the dull mass lies its im-
munity to all the obstinate questioning of the disgruntled
mind.
“It need never know. The behaviour of the shoal in which
it lives and moves and has its being will still for a brief sea-
son supply the wanted material for that appreciative, exult-
ing, tragic, pitiful or derisive comment which constitutes art
and literature. Mind may be near the end of its tether, and
yet that everyday drama will zo on because it is the normal
make-up of life and there is nothing else to replace it.
“To a watcher in some remote entirely alien cosmos, if we
may assume that impossibility, it might well seem that ex-
PoETS AND VISIONARIES 135
tinction is coming to man like a brutal thunderclap of Halé!
“.. . We may be spinning more and more swiftly into the
vortex of extinction, but we do not apprehend as much.”
A veil of deep gloom had descended on the most ebullient
of the writers of his generation. It was not a case of a
religious believer losing his faith. H. G. Wells had been an
atheist since youth. He did not see the end in the fashion of
Michelangelo’s Sistine fresco; nor did he see the extinction
of man and with him all life as the supreme debacle of homo
sapiens upon reaching the forbidden summit. Nature, to-
gether with all its laws, thought to be eternal, disbands it-
self.
“A harsh queerness is coming over things and rushes past
what we have hitherto been wont to consider the definite
limits of hard fact. Hard fact runs away from analysis and
does not return. . . . The limit of size and space shrinks and
continues to shrink inexorably. The swift diurnal return of
that unrelenting pendulum, the new standard of reference,
brings it home to our minds that hard fact is outpacing any
standard hitherto accepted. We pass into the harsh glare of
hitherto incredible novelty.”
Three thousand million years of Organic Evolution
(Wells capitalizes these words) are swiftly coming to the
end and the finale is in sight. “. . . The divergence widens
between what our fathers were wont to call the Order of
Nature and this new harsh implacable hostility to our uni-
verse, our all.”
But who is hostile if there is no God and no Devil? Wells
looked for a definition, “cosmic process,” “the Beyond,”
“the Unknown,” “the Unknowable,” and rejected them all
because they carry “unsound implications.” Unable to for-
mulate anything better, Wells settled on the “Antagonist.”
It will bring an end to evolution and the “dust-carts of Time
trundle that dust off to the incinerator... .”
Does not one hear in Wells’s agonized words the echo of
186 ieee IN AMNESIA
the Sibylline Oracles: “. . . and then shall flow a ceaseless
cataract of raging fire, and shall burn land and sea, and the
firmament of heaven and the stars and creation itself it shall
cast into one molten mass and clean dissolve. Then no more
shall there be the luminaries’ twinkling orbs, no night, no
dawn, no constant days of care, no spring, no summer, no
winter, no autumn.”
As if continuing the Sibylline prophecy, Wells rises from
his seat in benighted London alight with the beacons of
conflagrations and says:
“Hitherto, recurrence has seemed a primary law of life.
Night has followed day and day night. But in this strange
new phase of existence into which our universe is passing, it
becomes evident that events no longer recur. They go on
and on to an impenetrable mystery, into a voiceless limitless
darkness, against which this obstinate urgency of our dis-
satisfied minds may struggle, but will struggle only until it is
altogether overcome.
“Our world of self-delusion admits none of that. It will
perish amidst its evasions and fatuities.
“, . . the door closes upon us for ever more. There is no
way out or round or through.”
Is this a war-sick mind speaking to us? But Wells has not
referred to the raging war, to Dunkirk or Coventry, or to the
human beings herded into camps of death: he utters his sen-
tences as if not man but lifeless nature has become pitiless.
“Our universe is not merely bankrupt. . . it has not sim-
ply liquidated; it is going clean out of existence, leaving not
a wreck behind. The attempt to trace a pattern of any sort is
absolutely futile.
“This is acceptable to the philosophical mind when it is at
its most philosophical, but for those who lack that steadying
mental backbone, the vistas such ideas open are so uncon-
genial and so alarming, that they can do nothing but hate,
repudiate, scoff at and persecute those who express them,
POETS AND VISIONARIES VST
and betake themselves to the comfort and control of such
refuges of faith and reassurance as the subservient fear-
haunted mind has contrived for itself and others throughout
the ages.”
I interrupt the quote to contemplate: inadvertently Wells
has revealed that the great fear which took possession of
him is as old in the human race as religion. It would only be
expected that in the next sentence he would let surface the
ancestral fear of a destroyer from cosmic places, for whom
he had sought a name.
“Our doomed formicary is helpless as the implacable An-
tagonist kicks or tramples our world to pieces. Endure it or
evade it; the end will be the same... .”
In the pandemonium of bombed London, to which Wells
was outwardly indifferent, surfaced an ancient, even prime-
val horror.
A year later, the much-plagued planet having circled once
on its orbit, a blinding flash and a mushroom “as the smoke
of a furnace” inaugurated the Age of Terror.
