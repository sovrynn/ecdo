PROLOGUE
THE GOOD EARTH
It has been immensely difficult for the mind of man to part
with the conviction that his Earth is immovable and in the
center of Creation, thus in the center of the system to which
the Sun, the Moon and the planets belong, and in which the
stars are without a clear purpose or design. It is possible that
the dogmatic opposition to the heliocentric system of the
universe would not have been so complete and adamant
were it known that though the Earth is not located in the
center of the system, it occupies the preferred position and
possesses the optimal conditions for life and its progress.
The Sun is a blazing flame. Mercury, the planet closest to
the Sun, is so hot on its illuminated side that some metals
would be molten; its face is licked by solar plasma and it has
only a rudiment or a vestige of an atmosphere. Venus is en-
shrouded in massive clouds of dust and gases and is well over
800°F. at its ground surface, equally on its lighted and shad-
owed sides. Its period of daylight is as long as fifty-eight ter-
restrial days; its night is of equal length. The ancients called
it Lucifer, and it is a hell, and no life could be sustained on
its surface under the dark canopy of dust. These two planets,
Mercury and Venus, are situated on orbits between the Sun
and Earth.
2 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
Farther in space, Mars moves on an orbit of 687 terrestrial
days; its own day is nearly of the same duration as ours, and
its seasons, of double length, have the same sequence as
ours; but it receives only half as much heat per unit of sur-
face as the Earth does. If there were water on Mars it would
be mostly frozen, but it seems that there is none or exceed-
ingly little. The surface of Mats is all pocked by craters; it
does not have a bucolic appearance as some thought, but is a
landscape of pits and crags and waste.
Between Mars and Jupiter fragments of some exploded
body, numbering in the thousands, move on orbits, and
some of them cross the path of Mars and even of Earth. Sev-
eral of the chunks are billions of tons heavy, but none is con-
ceivable as an abode of life.
Jupiter and Saturn, five and nine times farther from the
Sun than the Earth, receive per equal area something like
one twenty-fifth and one eightieth of the solar light and heat
that Earth receives. Their atmospheres contain ammonia
and methane; the inner conditions are unknown. These plan-
ets have recently been considered dark stars; Jupiter is a
powerful source of radio signals and has a violently moving
atmosphere.
Of the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, we
know little, but what we know does not suggest them as
places fit for the creation and procreation of life, so removed
are these planets from the Sun, the dispenser of light and
warmth.
Our own satellite, the Moon, is a scene of desolation:
spilled oceans of lava and innumerable craters, no atmos-
phere and no water, half a month of exposure to scorching
rays of the Sun, followed with little transition by half a
month of night, unprotected by an atmosphere or by clouds
from the coldness of space. As against all these inhospitable
surroundings, the Earth is a blessed abode. We have plenti-
ful water. Four fifths of the planet is covered by oceans;
PROLOGUE 3
evaporating,
the
water
is
desalinized
and
is
returned
in
rain.
Rivers
and
lakes
are
distributed
on
all
five
continents; these
continents
are
a
safe
area
for
man,’a
terrestrial
animal,
to
walk.
Earth
is
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
oxygen,
diluted
in
nitrogen, one
part against four
parts,
so
that
the
oxidation
process—in
the
act
of
animal
breathing—does
not
burn
the
tissues.
Plants live in a symbiosis with the animals—the latter con-
sume oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, and the former
consume carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen. From the min-
erals of the ground, from water, air and sunshine, plants ex-
tract their food and produce their fruits, each plant on a for-
mula of its own, and animals feed on these fruits.
The water of this planet, outside of the oceans, is partly
frozen or solid, partly liquid and flowing, and partly in the
state of vapor that moistens the atmosphere. The oceans are
a rich abode of life (actually life is supposed to have origi-
nated there, to emerge with time and populate a land ready
to accept it and give it the chance to multiply).
The Earth in its entirety is surrounded by a mag-
netosphere that protects it and its inhabitants from the nox-
iousness of cosmic rays, particles of energy hurled by the
Sun and other stars with millions and billions of electron
volts of charged energy. Under the cover of the mag-
netosphere a layer of ozone protects the Earth and its
denizens from ultraviolet light—the mutation-producing
spectrum of invisible light accompanying the visible light
coming from the Sun. X rays coming from space are also
filtered out, and meteoric dust is mostly burned out in flight
through the atmosphere.
The Earth, with its atmosphere and oceans, rotates on its
axis once in about twenty-four hours, and thus the alterna-
tion of day and night follows at periods convenient to the
interchange of activity and rest, or nightly sleep. This meas-
4 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
ured sequence,
so
pleasing
to
us,
is
of
much
more
rapid
suc-
cession on the giant
Jupiter,
where
day
and
night
in
the
mean
are
less
than
five
hours
each.
How
different
would
be
our
working
hours
and
our
social activities
if
the
entire
span
from
rising
to
going
to
sleep
were only
five
hours,
or
inter-
changed
once
in fifty-eight
terrestrial
days
as
on
Venus,
or
at
even longer
intervals
as
on
Mercury.
On the Earth, traveling in an orbit of 365 days’ duration,
the plants complete their cycle, and with each new circling
nature regenerates; the inclination of the axis to the plane of
revolution causes seasons and their sequence.
These situations and phenomena are responsible for the
development of life on the planet and for its progression to
presently existing forms, man included. With all his ingenu-
ity, man has not yet succeeded in creating life from in-
organic material; but nature—light and heat and other forms
of energy in proper proportions applied to matter containing
the element carbon—started life and developed it, discard-
ing numerous forms but selecting others, until through
many vicissitudes homo sapiens evolved and in a rapid prog-
ress developed arts and industries, and multiplied his inter-
ests and enjoyments, listened to tonal vibrations and created
symphonies, distinguished colors and created visual art, an-
other of his worlds of imagination. To live in comfort, he in-
vented thousands of devices and to live in security he pro-
vided for law and its enforcement.
Man js curious about the world of nature around him and
studies the chromosomes and genes, the microcosmos of
molecules and atoms and subatomic particles, and the mac-
rocosmos of stars and galaxies. He finds that there are bil-
lions of galaxies; a galaxy like the Milky Way has a hundred
billion stars, and probably some of the stars have planets re-
volving around them—but is there a chance that conditions
PROLOGUE 5
on
them
are
ripe
or
beneficial
for
life
and
its
development?
No
signals
have
yet arrived
from
outer
space
that
could
be
ascribed
to
intelligent
senders;
having
learned
how
deso-
late
Venus
and Mars
are,
we
are
certain that
we
are
the
only
intelligent
inhabitants
of
the
solar
system, regardless
of
whether
or
not
in
the past other
planets,
possibly
on
different
orbits,
had developed
life
on
them.
Gone forever are the little green men—the Venusians, the
claimed sighting of whom was accepted as a fact by gullible
people. Then there were the Martians, a breed of strange
design, who existed in the fantasy of many but were de-
tected by nobody. It is nearly seven and a half billion miles
across the orbit of the farthest planet, and over twenty-five
trillion miles to the next star, with the domain of our Sun
stretching over an area of an equal diameter. Our solar sys-
tem is meaningful, more than for anything else, as the abode
of man. Nature is certainly generous and free-spending to
allow all this space for the luxury of creating man, but the
actual space he occupies is immeasurably small in that area
delineated by the Sun’s dominion—a planet eight thousand
miles across. In our age, man circled this ball of rock, with
its oceans and atmosphere, in ninety minutes of travel. Light,
if traveling in a circle, would go around the Earth eight
times in a single second, and this is our portion of the uni-
verse.
A world so puny in so large a space—but in the opti-
mal portion of that space: are we not lucky? The question
is self-negating because we would not be here if the condi-
tions were not so beautifully arranged. It may appear that
Providence must be behind the plan and that the conditions
that prevail on Earth now must have been prearranged and
existing from the beginning of time, at least from the first
stage in the development of the solar system. But the fright-
ening fact is that the conditions in which we live and de-
velop were not always the same from the beginning.
6 MANKIND IN AMNESIA
The
study
of
catastrophic
events
that
took
place
in
histori-
cal
times,
as
late
as
the
beginning
of the
seventh century
be-
fore
the
present
era,
and
on
a
greater
scale
eight
hundred
years
earlier,
in
the
fifteenth
century
before
the
present
era,
these
being
the
last
of
a
series
of
such
events—a
study
offered
in
Worlds
in
Collision—makes
it
abundantly
clearthat
more
than
once
our
planet
escaped
destruction
by
a
narrow
margin.
Further,
in
times past neither the
size
nor
the
form
of
the Earth’s
orbit,
nor
the
duration
of
its
year
and
its
seasons, nor
the direction of
its
axis,
nor
the
rate
of
rota-
tion
and
thus the
length
of
the
day,
were
the
same
as
at
pres-
ent.
Thus
fate
willed
that
the
Earth should
survive—but
whether
it
was
by
blind
fate
or
by
a
protective
Providence,
we
are,
as
I
put
it
at
the
end
of
Earth
in
Upheaval,
“de-
scendants
of survivors,
themselves
descendants
of
survi-
vors.”
In such close brushes with a fatal destiny, not all species
left survivors—multitudes of forms of life were destroyed to
the last member. Especially abundant were total casualties
among mammals, and also among birds, amphibians and
fish.
The lesson learned from the history of the globe is that it
passed from one condition to another—changed position in
space, changed climate and order of seasons, with different
distribution of water and land—and that throughout the pre-
human and prehistoric periods there occurred even greater
cataclysms than exist in the memory of man, as the geologi-
cal and paleontological records teach us. Yet some of the ani-
mal forms, like the tiny foraminifera in the ocean, succeeded
in surviving, at least in part, without going through complete
metamorphosis.
From the fact that in a matter of merely ten thousand
years man made the passage from the stage of unpolished
stone (Paleolithic) all the way to the so-called Western
civilization of our day—and ten thousand years is but about
PROLOGUE 7
one half of one millionth of the age of the Earth, as the mod-
ern. geophysicists assess it—one must conclude that Nature,
while destroying many, wished to create ever better condi-
tions for at least some of those destined to survive as spe-
cies,
Learning of the perilous path man and his animal com-
panions traveled in eons past to reach conditions felicitous
for procreation and advance, one cannot but wonder again
whether Providence planned and willed it, or whether a
blind fate was behind our survival, when so many forms of
life were extinguished and when other planets fared so much
less happily.
As it is now, man is the prince of Creation; Earth is the
most fortunate planet in the solar system and the Sun’s most
important role is to care for us, inhabitants of Earth. If there
were civilizations on any of the other planets, they are no
more: there is only one civilization for the Sun to serve—the
civilization of man.
