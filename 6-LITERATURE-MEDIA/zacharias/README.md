However, if acceleration of synchronized anomalies continues its post-2020 trend, potentially reaching such extreme LOD, polar motion, and SV values, mathematical extrapolation projects TPW onset in ~9-12 years (~2034-2037), depending on thresholds, where full decoupling triggers the rapid reorientation characteristic of the Tau phase.

2029-2032 soonest.
