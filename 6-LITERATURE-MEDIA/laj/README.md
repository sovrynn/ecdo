Studies geomagnetic excursions.

Two of his papers, one discussing the Laschamp excursion, and one on an impending geomagnetic excursion, in this folder.

## An impending geomagnetic transition (South Atlantic Anomaly)

"Gubbins (1987) noted that a patch of flux occurring below the southern tip of Africa had opposite sign to that expected for a dipole field in the Southern Hemisphere, when extrapolated at the core mantle boundary (the South Atlantic Anomaly or SAA). He suggested that “the present fall of the dipole field is directly related to the intensification and southward migration of this and other similar patches and that the fall may occasionally leads to polarity reversal.”"

"More recently, Hulot et al. (2002) have compared the 2002 data from the Danish Oersted Satellite with those obtained from the US satellite Magsat that operated in 1979/1980 and interpreted variations of the magnetic field over this 20 years period down to previously inaccessible length scales. Hulot et al. (2002) showed that growth and poleward migration of these reversed flux patches account almost entirely for the decrease in the dipole field in the last two centuries. They postulate “that the present magnetic state of the Earth may be one in which the geodynamo operates before reversing,” consistent with, but with a much better spatial resolution than Gubbins’ (1987) suggestion."
