CHAPTER 13
World Religions: The Great Slave Maker
When you visit someone at their home for the first time, it is always
fascinating to scan the photographs scattered on the walls and furniture,
showing off their close family and friends. Within minutes, one gets a
sense of the person’s background, where they were born, where they grew
up, how well-off they are and how many brothers and sisters they have.
Are the parents still together or divorced? Where do they live now? Baby
pictures, school pictures, graduation pictures, pictures of their animals
and even pictures of their cars in some instances. It presents a reasonably
complete collage of your host’s family and history as well as their social
standing. It fills you with a sense of comfort, knowing a little more about
your host. Suddenly the expression, ‘the apple never falls far from the
tree’ becomes relevant again when trying to analyse your host’s character
and personality. Subconsciously you start to calculate whether the first
impressions you formulated of the host, before you were exposed to his
photographic display, match the evidence presented. We are often
surprised to discover something new from the photo gallery, something
which takes us by complete surprise. Especially if the host is of another
culture or lives in a foreign country. And so we are filled with a sense of
comfort as we settle down to a cup of tea or a braai (barbecue) in the
back-yard.
Let us imagine for a minute that we as the human family receive a
visitor for dinner from another planet. We manage to overcome any fear
of conflict because it just so happens that the guest speaks a distant
dialect of our own language. As they arrive we display pictures of our
human family, our brothers, sisters, cousins and nephews, but for some
reason we have no pictures of our parents. The visitor is immediately
very intrigued. Are we a bunch of orphans? Do we not know who ourparents are? With all this time on Earth, have we not had enough time to
find out? We then explain that we have many fathers upon which the
visitor bursts out laughing. He realises that we obviously do not know
anything about biology and he explains to us that it is impossible to have
more than one father. We then present our guest with the evidence of our
many fathers, by which time he realises that we are seriously disturbed
and uninformed, and we as humans need some serious guidance and a
refresher course on the origins of humanity. The visitor asks us if we are
not aware of the universal community of beings and whether we know
that we all come from one original source. He tells us of the common
practice of colonising new planets by the infinite number of evolved
intelligent species of beings; the extended practice and the right to
populate new planets with our own species if we are the first ones to get
there; the practice of creating genetically less advanced beings to perform
the tough task of manual labour on newly colonised planets, allowing
them to evolve to the highest level; at the same time continuing the cycle
of universal evolution and enlightenment of species; and when we reach
the highest level of evolution and enlightenment we rejoin the universal
community of beings from which we all originate; at which stage we are
reunited with our Creator the Universal Being, Creator of all things in the
universe.
This story really confuses us and makes us feel a little uneasy because
we are all very sure of who our father is, and we make an excuse for our
human brothers and sisters who claim that our father may be someone
else according to them. We try to convince our visitor that our father is
whom we believe he is. Although we have no evidence of it, it has been
passed down to us through many generations, so it must be true. Our
guest then asks to see a list of our human brothers and their supposed
fathers, and this is what we show him.

Our guest becomes very sad at the sight of this and realises that
somewhere along the line we, as the human race, have been lied to and
conned. This is in direct violation of the communal spirit of universal
beings. He explains that there are a number of rogue beings who were
included in the community of beings a little prematurely, who have beenknown to colonise planets but do not follow the common protocol of
educating and informing the newly created species about their origins and
their destiny. Such rogue beings are like pirates of the universe, raping
and pillaging planets for their wealth while creating a lesser evolved
being which cannot possibly understand its place in the universe. The
pirates often present themselves as gods of sorts, dealing brutally with
their newly created species. They use them for labour, for experiments
and for pleasure. These cosmic pirates leave behind an uninformed and
confused planet of beings, who may take forever to figure out the truth
about themselves. The common pattern on such planets is that the lesser
evolved beings start to create their own gods, mimicking the ones that
were introduced to them by the cosmic pirates. This leads to more
confusion and constant conflict as the new beings try to impose the
supremacy of their particular god over the rest of the new beings on such
a planet.
Apparently this is a growing concern among the community of
universal beings and all attempts are being made to prevent this from
happening in the future. It was a blatant mistake on the part of the
universal community to allow a group of ‘almost evolved’ beings to join
the highest community of beings. It seems that their 'almost' complete
genome was not quite sufficient to make them completely at one with the
Supreme Being in the universe. They will have to be restricted to a planet
and allowed more time to complete their evolution towards a complete
genome. Only then, will the genome be able to open all the ports in their
minds, which will allow them to plug into the universal spirit and join the
full community of universal spiritual beings without any complications.
At this point we feel very uncomfortable and scared, because we have
been warned about false prophets on many occasions by our respective
gods. This must surely be such a false prophet who will cause the ‘wrath
of god’ to be unleashed on us, which we do not deserve. So we kill our
visitor in the name of god, knowing that what we did was the right thing.
After all, the Bible and the Koran allow us to do this. We are permitted to
kill false prophets, for they are surely the disciples of Satan.Boy oh boy… what a pathetically confused species we are. Lost in the
vastness of the universe, searching for our roots, confused by so much
false knowledge passed down to us through the ages. All this
disinformation has to stop somewhere. But what will it take for us to
realise that we cannot have more than one father? We cannot all be
right… we cannot all claim to have the correct answer. Somewhere out
there is the truth, and as it usually happens, it is probably too close for us
to see. But it should be easy to spot the indigenous tree in a forest of
invasive alien species. Let’s get one thing straight. There is not a single
religion on Earth that was created by God. But there are several which
were imposed on us by the ancient gods. There is not one single book on
Earth that was written by God. But there are many that were inspired by
the activity of the ancient gods. Take a look at the number of man-made
religions around us. It is clear that a situation like this could only have
emerged out of uncertainty. If we knew who our creator was, we should
have all received the same instructions, surely? The fact that we have so
many conflicting ideas, leads me to believe that we have been the victims
of continued disinformation over long periods of time as well as the
victims of a meticulously executed manipulation of the facts to keep us
ignorant and in a continuous state of conflict. It’s as if the captain has
abandoned ship and left it floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean
filled with five-year-olds. What chance do they have to steer the ship to
the nearest port and to safety? Virtually zero. But if the ship is lucky
enough not to encounter any storms for a long, long time, while the
currents take them along, they may be lucky enough to work out how to
steer this ship for themselves. But there is a very good chance they will
all perish in an inevitable storm.
The list of religions we looked at serves as concrete evidence that we
have been deserted on this planet without an instruction manual. To prove
their supremacy, most religions have brought out their own manuals,
claiming that theirs is the original manual to guide humanity into their
future and the kingdom of God. But how can they be such conflicting
manuals? Surely the real builders or creators of this ship must have had
only one set of plans to build it? Maybe not, maybe they were notqualified builders to begin with and therefore the ship is in such disarray.
Some manuals seem to put us in reverse gear whereas others are rammed
into the first gear, not quite sure where the second is.
Okay, enough metaphors and parables, I am sure that by now you get
my drift. To make my argument even more compelling, let us take a look
at the world's major religions and the numbers of followers. It has ‘recipe
for disaster’ written all over it, pitting one group against another. The
largest and strongest will want to defend its position and grow, while the
others will want to spread their doctrine in an attempt to become the
dominant religion. There are more religions today than countries in the
world. This creates an additional dilemma and sends a stern warning to
politicians, that religion may yet again become the driving force of
politics in the future. Something that modern democracies have been
working very hard to overcome. The principle of ‘divide and conquer’ has
been meticulously applied in all the instances of these religions, showing
that the ancients gods of Sumer were cunning strategists and extremely
shrewd military commanders. The religious statistics point unavoidably
to a conflict situation in our present state of mind. Tolerance has not won
the day as yet. It’s as if it was purposely so devised, to steer humanity
into a perpetual situation of war.

The world population was assessed to be very close to 6.5 billion in
December 2004. You will note that the total of the adherents is larger
than the global population. This could be because of the duplication of
followers of different religions. A rather strange phenomenon which has
puzzled me while compiling this. According to these stats there are about
8.5 billion people in the world making up 133% of the population. How
do they calculate these figures?
For us humans on planet Earth, there are many seemingly insurmountable
obstacles in our path to evolution and peace. As we evolve, more people
embrace the possibility of the newfound truths about our past. The most
important questions we need to answer are, who we are, and where we
come from. But these answers will not be presented to us on a platter with
a treasure-hunter's kit and a map to get to the prize. Fortunately we have
now started to uncover some very uncomfortable evidence, which does
not seem to tell the same story that we have been told about our history.The biggest obstacles to our growth as a species, to find peace and
harmony, are the many man-made religions. It will not be easy to
convince devout Christians and Muslims to start considering new
possibilities. It instantly turns the messenger into a false prophet who has
been sent by the devil. The creators of humanity were the finest
strategists ever. They managed to create the perfect environment for
continued doubt and conflict. They created the most perfect propaganda
tools ever: fear, punishment and reward. It is all so simple, isn't it?
Hopefully this will not be the message that we teach the citizens of the
new planets we are soon to start populating. But since we ourselves have
no clear answers for our origins, what will we teach the newly cloned
colonies of humans on other planets in the near future?
While religion plays a crucial role in shaping our communities, we live
our lives reasonably sheltered from the diversity of other religions. We
may drive past a mosque on our way to work every day, but how often do
we actually take the trouble to find out more about the people who
worship there? When Jehovah's Witnesses knock on our door to spread
their message, how many of us actually take the time to listen to what
they have to say? It is this kind of detachment that keeps us divided and
wrapped up in feelings of superiority over other religions, because our
god is always bigger and better than the other's. The study of religion is
truly fascinating and it helps us understand the murky origins which they
all share. Only once we have looked at the very sketchy roots of the most
popular religions of the world, can we begin to understand that they are
all built on the same shaky ground. We also begin to realise that all
religions are man-made and therefore cannot be deemed to be divine,
because man is fallible. It would be very laborious to try to educate the
readers of this book about all global religion, and also unfair to reduce
them to a page of editorial. But I have chosen to give you a quick
overview of the twelve most popular religions on Earth, just to help you
understand some of the similarities and shortcomings. It will help you
formulate your own opinions about the religious dogma which has
evolved over thousands of years to keep us seemingly happy, but totally
enslaved and divided as a species. They are listed in order of size andhistorical influence on the global populace.
Christianity. Origin circa 30 AD.
This is by far the largest of the world religions with almost twice as many
followers as its closest rival, Islam. From the digging that I undertook
during the writing of this book, I was amazed to discover that Christianity
somehow made it against all odds. It was a struggling young philosophy
in the days after the crucifixion of Jesus, with the disciples devoting their
lives to the spreading of the word; but it certainly was not easy. They
were often threatened, chased away or made to feel very unwelcome. You
have to remember that the pretty clean image we have developed of Jesus
and the disciples is very far from the truth. Those were difficult times for
him and his relatively small group of followers. As Barbara Thiering puts
it in Jesus of the Apocalypse, “He was a central figure in a major political
movement which was working at overthrowing the pagan Roman
empire.” She goes on to reveal a staggering bit of information that
becomes another perfectly fitting piece in our Great Human Puzzle. Even
at this point in time, the gods were as active as ever and Christianity was
flying right in the face of the huge support for the many Hellenic gods
from days gone by. She continues, “The enormous number of followers of
the new, still underground religion, introduced from Judea long before
the time of Jesus, were ready to believe in divine figures who were the
subjects of visions and miracles. It was the world of Hellenism, where
pagan religions had encouraged the idea of human beings as incarnations
of gods.”
So while there is reference that the people of the day were still being
manipulated by their Sumerian gods, Christianity was hanging on. They
were persecuted, tortured, fed to lions in the Colosseum and generally
abused in various ways. This was not a good time to be a Christian. This
situation continued for nearly 300 years, when suddenly Flavius Valerius
Constantinus - 272 - 337 AD - came to the rescue. Commonly known as
Constantine the Great, he became known as the first ‘Christian Emperor’
of the Roman empire and began the Empire's unofficial sponsoring of
Christianity, which was a major factor in the survival and spread of thereligion. His reputation as the first ‘Christian Emperor’ was promulgated
by Lactantius and Eusebius and gained ground in the succeeding
generations. He founded the city of Constantinople as the new capital of
the Eastern Empire which became the home of Christianity, filled with
large numbers of churches and temples. He also proclaimed that Sunday
would be the day of worship.
The First Council of Nicaea, which took place during the reign of the
emperor Constantine in 325 AD, was the first ecumenical (worldwide)
conference of bishops of the Christian Church. The participating bishops
were given free travel and lodging. The council, which was also called a
synod, dealt with the problems created by the Aryan controversy,
concerning the nature and status of Jesus. The Aryans had their own
views of who Jesus really was. We must remember that Jesus spent most
of his growing life, since the age of 12 or 13 in the East, under the
influence of several eastern religious philosophies and Aryanism was just
one of them. Finally the Synod decided against the Aryans and voted in
favour of Trinitarianism, which suddenly made Jesus part of the Father
and the Holy Spirit. This was a whole new twist to the New Testament
and the Holy Trinity was born. Another outcome of the council was an
agreement by the bishops of all the Churches, to celebrate Easter on the
same day. This was by far the most important celebration on the Church
calendar, it was therefore important for all to celebrate the resurrection
together. Constantine became such a strong voice of Christianity that on
his deathbed he was ordained as the 13th Apostle.
These were the wild and wonderful early days of Christianity, when
most of its foundations were laid. The editing of the Bible’s New
Testament began to take shape, but it would take another 800 years before
the final version was decided upon. This long process is filled with
controversy because many books were omitted while others were
amended before they were included. A large number of books known as
the Apocrypha (hidden writings) have been the subject of much
controversy ever since they were deliberately excluded from the New
Testament. It was during this period that one of the first recordedreferences to the Catholic Church emerged. This Catholic denomination
of Christianity continued to expand into what it has become today. The
largest and most powerful wing of the Christian Church. This is what St.
Cyril of Jerusalem (315 -386 AD) had to say:
Why is the Church called Catholic?
“The Church is called Catholic or universal because it has spread
throughout the entire world, from one end of the Earth to the other.
Again, it is called Catholic because it teaches fully and unfailingly all the
doctrines which ought to be brought to men's knowledge, whether
concerned with visible or invisible things, with the realities of heaven or
the things of Earth. Another reason for the name Catholic is that the
Church brings under religious obedience all classes of men, rulers and
subjects, learned and unlettered. Finally, it deserves the title Catholic
because it heals and cures unrestrictedly every type of sin that can be
committed in soul or in body, and because it possesses within itself every
kind of virtue that can be named, whether exercised in actions or in words
or in some kind of spiritual charism.”
The Bible:
The Bible is a very complex and controversial book, but it remains the
most sacred book of the Christian faith. It is regarded to be the ‘Word of
God’, inspired by the Holy Spirit. It has been translated into 275
languages and possibly more, but the origins of the Bible remain very
unsettling, with too many people having had too much influence over the
final version. But as you will see, there really is no ‘one’ final version of
the Bible as various groups have made their own changes and presented
their copy as the ultimate word of God. The Old and New Testaments feel
as if they should not be part of the same religious philosophy. The one
preaches “an eye for an eye” and exalts the ‘god of vengeance’ while the
New Testament speaks of the ‘prince of peace’ and ‘god of Love’ and
teaches us to love our enemy, instead of destroying them. It is great
fodder for many sub-cults and sects within the Christian faith.
The original documents of the New Testament: all the books are
written in Greek, with the quotations from the Old Testament taken fromthe Septuagint. There are 4,500 manuscripts in Greek, 67 papyrus, 2,578
parchment and 1,600 lectionaries mainly in the Codex of the Vatican,
London, Paris, Cambridge and Washington.
The Old Testament: These books were written mostly in Hebrew and
Aramaic, some in Greek. None of the ‘original documents’ are in
existence, but what we have today are mainly the Greek Bible and the
Hebrew Bible. But then there are the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are still a
point of great controversy and concern for some, because they once again
raise the question, which of the books should be included in the Old
Testament?
The Greek Bible: the Septuagint originates from the 3rd century before
Christ. It is the Greek translation done in Alexandria by a group of 72
rabbis, 6 from each one of the 12 tribes, and hence the name, Septuagint,
was given to the translation. It has 46 books just like the actual Catholic
Bible, and it was the common version of the Bible among the Jews during
days of Christ and even after Christ. It was the version used and quoted
by the Evangelists and Apostles when they wrote the New Testament. It
was translated to Syriac, Coptic, and Latin (The Vulgate of St. Jerome) in
the 4th century AD.
The ‘Hebrew Bible’ or Masoretic Text: Written in the 6 th to 10th
centuries after Christ, by a group of scholars from Babylon and Palestine,
introducing vowels and accent signs to the Hebrew scripts. And of course,
they also used the Septuagint to produce it. It has 39 books, like the
Protestant Bibles.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are very important, because they are written in
Hebrew, dating from the 3 rd century BC, while the oldest Hebrew Bible,
the Masoretic, dates from 700 years after Christ. With the discovery of
the ‘Scrolls’ it suddenly pushed back the curtain some 1,000 years on the
earliest Hebrew documents. In the Scrolls, every book of the Bible is
represented with a remarkable similarity to the later scriptures in Greek
and Hebrew. This was a very important, yet controversial discovery
surrounding the Old Testament.
The Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Bibles:There are a total of 73 books in the Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but
only 66 books in the Protestant Bibles. The Old Testament is the same as
the Jewish Tanakh. The Catholic Bibles have 46 books, as the Bible of the
Jewish of Alexandria, who wrote the Septuagint, the version quoted by
the Apostles in the Gospels and Epistles. The Protestant Bibles have 39
books, as does the Bible of the Jews from Palestine.
They do not have the following:
4 Historic Books: Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees. (and
additions to Esther)
2 Wisdom Books: Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus of Ben Sirach.
1 Prophetic Book: Baruch, and parts of Daniel - The Prayer of Azariah,
the Song of the Three Young Men, Bel and the Dragon, and Susana.
The New Testament has 27 books in all the Bibles. The ‘Four Gospels’
are essentially the heart of the Bible. Some religious authors see the name
of Christ on every page of the Old Testament and claim that it “prefigures
and characterises” the Christ of the Gospels and His Church. But my
research has shown that the first time the word/name Christ ever appears
in the Bible, is in Matthew 1:1 of the New Testament. There is however a
constant reminder of the ‘Saviour’ which is mentioned the first time in
Deuteronomy 32:15, the fifth book of the Bible; Messiah is mentioned in
Matthew 1:1 for the first time; and Jesus also in Matthew 1:1. Jesus was,
and still is, a man’s name. ‘Christ’ means the “chosen one”, which
became associated with the name ‘Jesus’ after his ‘supposed’
resurrection. But the inexplicable absence of the name of Christ in the
early books of the Bible, is filled with suspicious undertones. Because the
Old Testament talks generically about a number of prophets or saviours,
but only one suddenly emerged, which happened to have been Jesus
Christ. I find this highly suspicious. Could not even one of the prophets
of the Old Testament have named Jesus? I suggest that the ‘gods’ were
preparing mankind for a saviour but they were not quite sure which ‘one’
of the prophets they had lined up, was going to strike a chord with the
people of the time.
One of the most fascinating and yet disturbing things about the booksof the Bible and their many relatives who did not make it into the Bible,
is that a bunch of men sitting around a boardroom table, some 350 years
after the death of Christ, decided on the fate of all the writings. The books
that made it are called Canonical, which could be translated to mean
‘according to the Christian set of laws’ or possibly even ‘inspired by
God’. They sat with a pile of books which mostly had the same authors,
and yet some were deemed to be canonical and others not. This is very
puzzling to me, but it obviously made a great deal of sense to the decision
makers way back then, because some of those writings contained things
which did not really fit their structured image of what the Christian
Church should represent.
Some facts about the Deutero-canonical and Apocryphal Books:
Deutero-canonical (second canon), was the term used in 1566 by the
Roman Catholic Church, meaning that their canonicity was recognised
only after a period of time. They are included in the Greek Septuagint
scriptures of the third century BC, but they are not included in the
Hebrew Masoretic scriptures from the 7th century AD. Some fragments
of these books have also been discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Strangely enough, they are included in the Catholic and Orthodox Bibles,
but they are usually not included in the Protestant Bibles. The Deutero-
canon include the following books and parts of books:
Historical: Tobit, Judith, First and Second Maccabees, Additions to
-
Esther
- Wisdom: Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (also called Ecclesiasticus).
Prophets: Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (in Baruch), and parts of
-
Daniel:
The Prayer of Azariah, the Song of the Three Young Men, Bel and the
Dragon, and Susana.
The Apocrypha (hidden things/writings):
This is a collection of books written mostly by authors of other books of
the Bible, but the Apocrypha were not included in any of the Bibles. They
deal with Christian and Biblical themes, some from the times of the OldTestament, others from the times of the New Testament.
Apocrypha of the Old Testament times:
There are over 25 books; this is a list of some: Acts of Adam, Apocalypse
of Adam, Abraham, Testament of Adam, Book of Enoch, Enoch II (Book
of the Secrets of Enoch), Book of Noah, Apocalypse of Barach (I),
Apocalypse of Barach (II), Apocalypse of Daniel, Apocalypse of Elijah,
Apocalypse of Enoch, Apocalypse of Ezra (Esdras), Apocalypse of
Solomon, Odes of Solomon, Testament of Isaac, Martyrdom of Isaiah,
Apocalypse of Zephaniah, Paralipomena of Jeremiah, Apocryphon of
Ezekiel, Ascension of Isaiah, Assumption of Moses, Baruch III, Baruch
IV, Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, Acts of Solomon, Chronicles of the
Kings of Judah, Maccabee III, Maccabee IV.
Apocrypha of the New Testament -Christian Apocrypha:
There are over 40 books this is a list of some: 14 Gospels, by Thomas,
James, Peter, Bartholomew... 15 Acts, by Andrew, Peter, Matthew, John,
Thomas, Paul... 6 Revelations, by Paul, Thomas, John, Virgin Mary,
Stephen, Peter... Acts of John, Acts of Paul, Acts of Paul and Thecla, Acts
of Peter, Apocalypse of James (I), Apocalypse of James (II), Apocalypse
of Peter, Apocalypse of Philip, Apocalypse of Stephan, Apocalypse of
Thomas, Apocryphon of John, Epistle of Pontius Pilate, Gospel of
Nicodemus, Gospel of Perfection, Gospel of Philip, Gospel of Peter,
Revelation of Peter, Protevangelium of James, Gospel of the Birth of
Mary, Gospel of the Hebrews, Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus Christ,
Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth, History of Joseph, Letter of Paul to
the Alexandrians, Testament of the Lord, Wisdom of Jesus.
So how do we know which books belong to the Bible? Or as the Church
would call it, the ‘canon’of the Bible?
Answer? “Because the Church tells us so!”. St. Augustine goes on
convincingly to say that “if the Church won't tell me these Books are the
Bible, I won't believe it”.
This is a perfect example of the ‘master-slave’ relationship between
the ancient gods and the primitive slave species, which I postulate in this
book. Humankind is told ‘do not question, do not doubt, stay fearful, yourreward will be great’. None of the books of the New Testament were even
written by the time Jesus was crucified, and yet he was the prophet who
made his mark on humanity. All the other prophets suddenly became
irrelevant as Jesus rose to take the centre stage. There is so much
preparation and expectation for over a thousand years of the coming of
the saviour, and yet we only find out his name after his birth. Does that
not strike you as very suspicious? There are another 35 books, dealing
with themes of the Old and New Testaments. They are attributed to
Enoch, Moses, Solomon, St. Paul, St. Thomas, St. James, St. Peter, Virgin
Mary; and they are also not in the Bible, because the Church says so!
But in 1517, the Christian Church, which was completely controlled by
the Catholics, was shocked when Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to
the door of the Church of All Saints in Wittenberg, which was used as a
customary notice board, inviting the priests to a debate. The letter
challenged the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on the nature of
penance, the authority of the pope and the usefulness of indulgences.
They sparked a theological debate that would result in the birth of the
Protestant, Lutheran, Reformed, and Anabaptist traditions within
Christianity. This was the real beginning of the Protestant Reformation
and the split from the Catholics by many who felt uncomfortable with the
violent stranglehold of the Catholic Church. The letter contained 95
points outlining what was essentially wrong with the teachings of the
Church.
After disregarding Luther as “a drunken German who wrote the Theses;
when sober he will change his mind,” Pope Leo X ordered the Dominican
professor of theology, Silvester Mazzolini, to inquire into the matter.
Prierias recognised Luther's dangerous potential, declared him a heretic
and wrote a scholastic refutation of the Theses. It asserted papal authority
over the Catholic church, and denounced every departure from it as a
heresy. You have to remember that Luther was playing with his life. He
could have been charged with various offences for doing this, but his
dislike for the Catholics was so intense that it became his passion. Even
so, the following excerpt from a letter shows his subservience to the
Catholics. The tone in which it is written may have been the style of theday, but one can almost smell the anxious fear between the lines,
knowing his days may be numbered. He even uses the word 'fear' in the
opening lines of the letter below. Is it not ironic that we are talking about
the representatives of the ‘House of God’ who were supposed to be the
disciples of love and peace? But as we discover in this book, our creator
and god, did not have those benevolent characteristics in his personal
arsenal.
Letter to the Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz – 31 October 1517.
“ To the Most Reverend Father in Christ and Most Illustrious Lord,
Albrecht of Magdeburg and Mainz, Archbishop and Primate of the
Church, Margrave of Brandenburg, etc., his own lord and pastor in
Christ, worthy of reverence and fear, and most gracious. The grace
of God be with you in all its fullness and power!
Spare me, Most Reverend Father in Christ and Most Illustrious
Prince, that I, the dregs of humanity, have so much boldness that I
have dared to think of a letter to the height of your Sublimity. The
Lord Jesus is my witness that, conscious of my smallness and
baseness, I have long deferred what I am now shameless enough to
do, moved thereto most of all by the duty of fidelity which I
acknowledge that I owe to your most Reverend Fatherhood in Christ.
Meanwhile, therefore, may your Highness deign to cast an eye upon
one speck of dust, and for the sake of your pontifical clemency to
heed my prayer.”
Luther had a very clear opinion on the Church of the time, believing
that the Catholics were only interested in lining their pockets and
controlling people with fear. “Many of the fanatics of our day pronounce
words of faith, but they bear no good fruit, because their purpose is to
turn men to their perverse opinions.” He also had his views on the Aryans
who were so prominent in the shaping of Christ's philosophies.
“The Aryans were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two
natures, and that He is called “very God of very God” they were yet
able to deny His divinity. The Aryans took Christ for a noble and
perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by Him Godcreated heaven and Earth. Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ.
But all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men.”
I do admit that I share Luther's concern about the ‘brutality’ of god, as
taught by the Church in 1517 and as it still continues to do today.
“I hated the just God who punishes sinners. In silence, if I did not
blaspheme, then certainly I grumbled vehemently and got angry at
God. I said, ‘Isn't it enough that we miserable sinners, lost for all
eternity because of original sin, are oppressed by every kind of
calamity through the Ten Commandments? Why does God heap
sorrow upon sorrow through the Gospel and through the Gospel
threaten us with his justice and his wrath?’ This was how I was
raging with wild and disturbed conscience.”
Luther initially preached tolerance towards the Jewish people, convinced
that the reason they had never converted to Christianity was that they
were discriminated against, or that they had never heard the Gospel of
Christ. However, after his overtures failed to convince Jewish people to
adopt Christianity, he began preaching that the Jews were set in evil, anti-
Christian ways, and needed to be expelled from the German body politic.
He repeatedly quoted the words of Jesus, in Matthew 12:34, where Jesus
called the Jewish religious leaders (Pharisees and Sadducees) of his day
“a brood of vipers and children of the devil”. In the book written three
years before his death, Luther listed seven recommendations how to deal
with the Jews:
“I shall give you my sincere advice: First, to set fire to their
synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will
not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of
them.... Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and
destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as in their
synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn,
like the gypsies.... Third, I advise that all their prayer books and
Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and
blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain
of loss of life and limb... Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways
be abolished completely for the Jews... Sixth, I advise that usury be
prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be
taken from them and put aside for safekeeping...
Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an axe, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a
spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting
them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the
children of Adam (Gen. 3:19)...”
In spite of these seven recommendations, he added:
“... But if we are afraid that they might harm us or our wives,
children, servants, cattle, etc., if they had to serve and work for us
for it is reasonable to assume that such noble lords of the world and
venomous, bitter worms are not accustomed to working and would
be very reluctant to humble themselves so deeply before the
accursed Goyim then let us emulate the common sense of other
nations such as France, Spain, Bohemia, etc., compute with them
how much their usury has extorted from us, divide this amicably, but
then eject them forever from the country. For, as we have heard,
God's anger with them is so intense that gentle mercy will only tend
to make them worse and worse, while sharp mercy will reform them
but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them!”
Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a
continuation of medieval Christian anti-Semitism, and as the above quote
shows, reflects earlier anti-Semitic expulsions in the 14th century, when
Jews from other countries like France and Spain were invited into
Germany. Since Luther's statements were widely read at the time, it is
possible that this doctrine fed anti-Semitism, leading to the Nazi era
about four centuries later. Early Nazi leaders loved to quote these
particular statements of Luther.
Does this rosy picture of our Christian history not disturb you yet? Itcertainly disturbs me greatly to see the shallow moral values, lack of
respect for humanity, hatred of others, infinite conceit and everything
that flies in the face of the ‘Love of God’. These are the foundations upon
which our unshakable faith is standing today. Are you not concerned? Are
you happy to accept it? Or can you see that something has gone wrong
somewhere in the distant past, to have caused this unacceptable situation?
But the angry Martin Luther went a lot further in criticising the Church
and the Jews. In accord with his posture as restorer of Christianity, he
took it upon himself to judge various books of the Bible as ‘God's holy
Word’. This was not a healthy situation for him. This is what he had to
say about some of the books of the Old Testament:
“We have no wish either to see or hear Moses... Job is merely the
argument of a fable... Ecclesiastes ought to have been more
complete. There is too much incoherent matter in it, Solomon did
not, therefore, write this book... The book of Esther I toss into the
Elbe. I am such an enemy to the book of Esther that I wish it did not
exist, for it Judaises too much and has in it a great deal of heathenish
naughtiness ... The history of Jonah is so monstrous that it is
absolutely incredible. . .”
The books of the New Testament fared no better. He rejected the
following from the canon – Hebrews, James, Jude and the Apocalypse.
Instead, he placed them at the end of his translation, after the others,
which he called “the true and certain capital books of the New
Testament” – “St. John is the only sympathetic, the only true Gospel and
should undoubtedly be preferred to the others. In like manner the Epistles
of St. Peter and St. Paul are superior to the first three Gospels.” The
Epistle to the Hebrews did not suit him either: “It need not surprise one to
find here bits of wood, hay, and straw.” Luther denounced The Epistle of
St. James as “an epistle of straw.” – “I do not hold it to be his writing,
and I cannot place it among the capital books.” He held this view because
it proclaimed the necessity of good works, contrary to his heresy. “There
are many things objectionable in this book”, is what he said about
Apocalypse. “I feel an aversion to it, and to me this is a sufficient reasonfor rejecting it.”
Now that we have dealt with the largest and possibly the most
confusing of the world’s religions, let us have a quick look at the rest of
the major world religions, demonstrating the chaos that exists amongst
humanity in a desperate attempt to find their roots. The information given
is intended to provide a short introduction to the major religions as
defined classically. Each description has been kept short and as
uncomplicated as possible.
Hinduism. Origin circa 4000 BC.
Hinduism is the most complex religious system that has evolved on
Earth. It is almost impossible to define it. But the origins of Hinduism
can be traced to the Indus Valley civilisation sometime between 4000 and
2500 BC. The origins are very murky and the influence of the early
settlers in this part of the world, called the Vedas, must have played a
crucial role in the origins of Hinduism, because the Vedic scriptures form
pretty much the largest part of the Hindu sacred texts. There was however
another group of people who had a huge impact on Hindu evolution, they
were called the Aryans. This group of highly skilled, highly educated,
industrialised and technologically advanced people had a profound
influence on all the Near Eastern and Indus religions. The Aryan history
is equally murky and their true origin and source of knowledge is very
mysterious. But, they were there in large numbers to influence the
Hindus, Jews, Christ and Christians and all the other global cultures for
over 2,000 years. But as much as some historians claim that the Aryans
began to write the Vedas when they arrived in the Indus Valley, this is
argued against very strongly by other scholars who have shown a Vedic
presence and culture in the region as far back as 8000 BC. The Vedas
were in possession of their Vedic poems in oral form for thousands of
years before they were finally written down. There are however others
who have presented astounding evidence that the Vedas may have been
able to write as far back as 8000 BC. This is at least 3,000 years before
the next known script emerged.
So let's take a quick look at these Aryans who also populated andconquered Europe. They inspired a very early class structure based on
skin colour, they were the earliest colonialists and even inspired modern-
day warriors like Hitler. Scholars believe that these Aryans originated
from somewhere in Northern Mesopotamia, south west of the Black Sea
in eastern Anatolia (Turkey). They are described as light-skinned or
‘whites’ who spoke a very early proto-European language from which all
the latter European languages evolved. This is fantastic news to feed my
theory because according to the Sumerian tablets the Igigi, (who were the
astronauts who looked after the base on Mars, while the Anunnaki were
those on Earth) came to Earth after the year of the Flood and took
Earthling females for their wives. They were treated almost as outcasts
by the Anunnaki in Sumer and therefore they moved away establishing
their own community in a land of their own. And guess where they moved
to? They went north towards the mountainous areas of Anatolia, south
east of the Black Sea, and to the Cedar mountains where Enlil had spent
much of his time as well. They were very white skinned and their
community grew rapidly as they shared their knowledge and technology
with their new human offspring. The new race of humans that emerged
out of this cohabitation was also white, and confident, because of their
‘godly’ ancestry. From there they infiltrated most of Asia and Europe
spreading their civilisation and language. As a result the languages
spoken in India actually fall into the various Indo-European languages.
Latin, Greek, Hittite, Sanskrit, French, German, Latvian, English,
Spanish, Russian and others, are all Indo-European (IE) languages; or
more properly Proto-Indo-European (PIE), which is the lost ancestral
language from which those languages originated. The Indo-European
language used the term ‘Aryan’ to classify a group of people not only
racially, but also ethnically based on the type of accent or ‘Aryan speech’
the people spoke. This should have been expected however. It is
fascinating to see how the gods who created Humankind as a lower slave
species, immediately classified them in a lower ethnic class, giving birth
to slavery and racism right at the beginning of humanity. Arya, meaning
‘noble’, appears in various Indo-European languages. Once again this
should be expected from the Igigi gods who regarded themselves as waysuperior to lesser mortal humans. They probably used the plural of the
word ‘Aryas nobles’ to describe themselves prior to their dispersal. It
may even have survived in Eire (Ireland), but it certainly survives in Iran
where they are referred to as “Airyanam vaejo” – ‘realm of the Aryans’.
The discovery of thousands of such cognate words in widely separated
languages, along with similar grammatical structures, led philologists to
conclude, early in the nineteenth century, that most European languages
had evolved from a common proto-language spoken millennia ago.
Greek, Latin and Sanskrit were considered the closest languages to
PIE, and much of the reconstructed Aryan proto-language is based on
them. Modern Lithuanian is thought to be the most archaic living
language, closer to the original Aryan speech than any other. Tocharian is
an Indo-European language which had been spoken in Chinese Turkestan,
indicating that the Aryans reached as far as China in the Far East. The
only possible explanation of how they could have had such an impact on
the entire European and Asian ancient history, is because they were more
advanced, or possibly even related to the ancient ‘gods’ of Sumer. And
that is exactly who they were. A ‘white’ blend between Igigi gods and
mortal humans who suddenly saw themselves in a higher bracket than the
rest of the mortal beings on Earth. A recent discovery of the remains of
blond-haired people in China is a large missing piece of the Great Human
Puzzle, which is beginning to take shape very quickly under the watchful
eye of science as it shows how far the Aryans explored.
Perhaps the most famous proof for the prehistoric existence of PIE is
the word for king: ‘rex’ in Latin, ‘raja’ in Sanskrit, ‘ri’ in Old Irish, along
with a host of others, all are obviously variants of a common word for
king. And since none of the peoples speaking these various languages
were in physical contact with one another during the historical period, for
which written records do exist, comparative philologists claim that their
respective languages must have evolved from a single proto-language.
The Aryans worshipped a sky-god, they traced descent through the male
line, they raised cattle, they drank mead, they used horse-drawn chariots
which they probably invented as weapons of war, which included bronze
and iron. The civilisations of Asia were completely outclassed andoutsmarted by the Aryans when they arrived.
Aryans, or more specifically Indo-Aryans, make their first notable
appearance in history around 2000 BC as invaders of Northern India. This
event holds firm with the behaviour of Anunnaki god Marduk, who was
proclaiming himself as 'god above all' at that time. The result of the
conflict between the Anunnaki in the biblical lands is well documented
and outlined in the last chapter. It was however around 2000 BC when
Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by the Anunnaki's nuclear and
biological weapons, which forced many inhabitants of the surrounding
lands to flee and evacuate. Remember that the white Aryans (Igigi) were
Marduk's followers, so when they suddenly made their appearance in the
Indus Valley, the ancient Vedic tales begin to carry much of the content
dealing with these invasions and subjugation of the dark-skinned
inhabitants.
The Sanskrit Rig Veda, a collection of religious texts still revered by
modern Hindus, carry enigmatic records of such events. This is another
perfect example of how historians have scrambled our brains over time,
because suddenly we have mythological gods clashing with actual
historic people. Hindus see this as history, while others have described it
as mythology. So if the invading ‘Aryan gods’ were mythological, who
are the Vedic poems referring to? Who was actually invading the Indian
lands? Or were they just imagining that too? How can you have a
situation where half of the historic records is deemed to be acceptable,
but the other half is ‘just a figment of their imagination, because they had
nothing better to do’? These events surrounding the Aryan invasion of
Indus are of paramount importance to the credibility of the ancient
‘gods’. Because there is no other time and place in history where we have
such detailed description of historic interaction between gods and men,
outlining the superiority of the gods and the subservience which was
forced upon the humans. In the following extract from a Vedic poem (Rig
Veda 1.53) the local people were referred to as the Dasyus.
ARYAN INVASION“Indra (Norse-Thor, Celtic-Taranis) has torn open the fortresses of
the Dasyus, which in their wombs hid the black people. He created
land and water for Manu (Aryan man); Lower than all besides, hast
thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus, abject tribes of Dasas; After
slaying the Dasyus, let Indra with his white friends win land, let him
win the sun and water; Indra subdued the Dasyus colour and drove it
into hiding." With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, Thou, far-
famed, hast overthrown the twice ten kings ...Thou goest from fight
to fight, intrepidly destroying castle after castle here with strength.”
(RV 1.53)
The Aryans were remarkably expansionist and almost everywhere they
went they conquered and subjugated the indigenous peoples, imposing
their languages and their religious beliefs on the natives. In turn, they
received contributions from the people whom they conquered. The
Aryans had very strong links to the Essenes sect of Hebrews, to which
Joseph and Jesus belonged. There is some evidence that it was the Aryans
who sponsored Jesus to travel the East and learn the cultures. Aryan
invasions had been going on for millennia, as far back as 4000 BC and
probably even further back, when they first began to conquer Europe.
Most of the contemporary inhabitants of Europe, along with their
respective early national cultures, are the result of interaction betweensuccessive waves of white Aryan invaders and their culture. Therefore
almost all modern European languages are members of the Western
branch of the Indo-European family tree.
The birth of a European culture predates the arrival of the Indo-
Europeans. The descendants of the biblical ‘Nefilim’ and their earthling
children moved away from Sumer according to the clay tablets. They
settled in distant lands which can only be identified as prehistoric Europe.
They were also white and more technologically advanced because they
possessed some of the Anunnaki’s genetic pool and influence. This means
that the coming together of the Old Europeans and the Aryans, actually
brought together two opposite sides of the advanced white Anunnaki
children who had interbred with Earthling females, as is so eloquently
outlined in Genesis. The cave art of Lascaux, which some have identified
as the first flowering of Western man's creative genius, was the work of
Old Europeans. Stonehenge in the North and the Minoan Palace culture of
Crete in the South are other examples. A pan-European religious
symbolism had already evolved but once again much of it was later
incorporated into IE mythologies, including various regional adaptations
of European reverence for the Mother Goddess. Many of the principal
figures in Greek mythology predate the arrival of the Aryans, which
means they must have arrived with the Nefilim from Sumer. This would
have been the other group of Anunnaki offspring, who married earthling
females and started a whole new race of humans; a white and
domineering race. During the course of ancient history, Old European
religious beliefs and practices continually reasserted themselves, such as
the image of the Minoan snake goddess, from the Palace of Minos, circa
1600 BC, but it probably has much older origins.
Europe is European because the conquerors and the conquered were
members of the same white race, different branches on the same family
tree. One came in from the South-West while the others, mainly Aryans,
arrived from the North East. India is a morass of poverty because the bulk
of the conquered, with whom the Indo-Aryans eventually intermarried,
were non-white Veddoids. The lesson is obvious. Even today high-caste
Hindus can still be identified by their Caucasian features and light skin,and the poorest and most ‘backward’ parts of India are generally the
darkest. Were the Aryans the original promoters of ‘apartheid’? It
certainly looks like it. Where else would modern Europeans have got it
from? Everything we have and we know was handed down to us by our
ancient ancestors, the Sumerians, who were taught everything they knew
by the Anunnaki gods. If we extrapolate this timeline a little further back
in time to the point of the creation of ‘Adamu’ and we analyse how the
whole human race issue was handled by the gods for thousands of years
right up to the rapid expansion and globalisation by the Anunnaki under
the leadership of Marduk, which included the Igigi, who were actually the
Aryans, we arrive at the conclusion that ‘god’ our maker, was the first
racist. It is very disturbing to discover that the wise Anunnaki gods who
settled on this planet with all their knowledge could allow such
disorganised chaos to evolve. But maybe that is exactly what they had in
mind – divide and rule. Keep the slave species subjugated at all cost.
Recent genetic studies have indicated that the Basques of Aquitaine and
the Pyrenees are probably the purest form of Old European as they
existed prior to the arrival of Indo-European invaders. They evidently
emerged from the invasions of Europe unconquered, and they remained
sufficiently isolated to retain their own unique, non-IE language.
Now that we have dealt with the very important issue of the Aryans, we
can return to the Hindus and their religious and cultural development
before and after the influence of the Aryans. While many believe that
Hinduism is a polytheistic religion which worships many gods, the basis
of Hinduism is the belief in the unity of everything. This totality is called
Brahman. The purpose of life is to realise that we are part of God, and
that by doing so, we can leave this plane of existence and rejoin with
God. This enlightenment can only be achieved by going through cycles of
rebirth, life and death known as ‘samsara’. And yet the major part of this
religious practice is to worship the god Vishnu, who seems to be the
prominent god; or Shiva or the goddess Shakti; or their many other
incarnations, aspects, spouses or progeny.
In Hinduism, one’s progress towards enlightenment is measured by
one’s karma, which is the accumulation of all one’s good and bad deeds,and which determines the person’s next reincarnation. Selfless acts and
thoughts as well as devotion to God, will help one to be reborn at a higher
level in the caste system. Bad acts and thoughts will cause one to be born
at a lower level, as a person or possibly even as an animal. Hindus follow
a strict system called ‘caste’, which determines the social importance or
standing of each person. The caste which one is born into is the result of
the karma from their previous life. Only members of the highest caste,
the Brahmins, may perform the Hindu religious rituals and hold positions
of authority within the temples. The earliest cultures in Mesopotamia
were building many temples to the different gods presiding over
individual villages. It is curious that historians refer to those as
‘mythology’ and yet, the Hindu sects are still practising this form of
religious worship today. But in India it is called a religion and nobody
will dare to call their gods mythological figures. Just as the gods in the
Sumerian tablets had various towns or villages to look after, and were
worshipped as such, so are Hindu gods still worshipped today – different
gods in different villages. Hindus join a sect by undergoing initiation and
learning the sacred ‘mantra’ of that sect, which is presented to them by
the ‘guru’. The mantra is in the form of an ‘Om’ homage to the god
which the sect belongs to and is normally the god of that village.
But the entire vast Hindu family of sects and offshoots emerged from
the proto-Hindu culture known as the Veda, which originated in the Indus
Valley. The Rig Veda is the oldest of the collection of Vedic hymns and is
the oldest living religious literature in the world, predating the Bible by
thousands of years. The total collection of Vedic poems or hymns
consists of 1,028 hymns to the Vedic deities. The origin of these can be
traced back to around 8000 BC according to some scholars. Incredibly
they survived for thousands of years by being handed down in the oral
tradition until they were finally written down.
The Vedas are the most sacred scriptures of Hinduism. According to
tradition, “when God creates the worlds, He reveals the Vedas for the
welfare of the worlds and when He ends the creation, He takes them back
again”. Some people say that all human knowledge is available in the
Vedas in symbolic form and that the knowledge of all our discoveries andinventions is already contained in the Vedas. It is true that the Vedas are
not mere books of some magical chants but they are loaded with ancient
historical knowledge from a time before time, which reveals itself step by
step. They are Rig Veda; Sama Veda; Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda.
The Atharva Veda is different from the other three Veda collections, in
that it contains spells and incantations for medicinal purposes, magical
aids to victory in battle and so on. The Vedic collections are
complemented by a series of works called the Brahmanas, which are
devoted to the explanation of the hymns, their ritual applications and
their mythology. It is the Vedic books called the Aranyakas and
Upanishads which push the religion towards a monistic philosophy. It is
only in the pages of the Upanishads that we first find references to death
and rebirth of the soul, and not in the much older Vedas. It seems as if the
Aryans had a lot to do with the writing of these scriptures, most likely for
the purpose of enslaving the locals with religious dogma. The rather
strange and ‘non-Hindu’ contents of the Upanishads resembles the
assertions of the followers of Marduk, promising humans an eternal
afterlife, but only if they behaved themselves, and followed god's
commands. They did this very successfully in Egypt with the Pharaohs,
but in the Indus Valley they added a very juicy twist... if you do not obey
god's commands, you will be reborn as a dirty animal. This was actually a
brilliant form of mental torture. The people were already experiencing
hardship on Earth, waiting to escape it. There could be nothing more
horrific than the thought of having to return to this realm to live in
harsher conditions than before. And so these descendants of the Sumerian
gods were on the move, conquering and subjugating humans in their path.
There are so many rituals and different cultural applications by the
various sects of Hinduism, that it would take up the rest of this book and
much more to begin to capture it all. The fascinating thing about
Hinduism, is its murky origin in distant prehistory, where the Vedic
poems originated. Every single poem deals with one or more ancient gods
in various ways. Either praising him or her, exalting them, worshipping,
asking for favour, wisdom, wealth, courage and thousands of other human
needs. It seems as if the people of those early days had a very differentrelationship with their gods when compared to the modern Hindus. What
is even more interesting, is that those early Vedic gods resembled the
ancient Sumerian gods to perfection. They had similar functions,
denominations, characters and personalities and all other aspects of their
being. They liked their material offerings of gold and food, just like their
Sumerian counterpart gods, and they could be equally brutal in
dispensing punishment to unlucky followers. And yet on different
occasions they would reward their obedient followers with material
wealth. According to the Sumerian clay tablets it was the talented
goddess of love, Inanna, who was given this Asian domain to look after.
Is it not strange that her high sexual appetite and love for poetry and
music, turned out to be the cultural centrepiece of the Indian people? But
it goes even further. There is a plethora of references to the gods of
Sumer, mirrored in the Vedic poems. We see them riding in sky chariots,
displaying all kinds of fierce weapons, slaying their foes with ease by
using weapons that closely resemble both the biblical descriptions, and
those of the Sumerian tablets. During excavation in Harappa, one of the
largest ancient Indus cities, the predominant effigies, statues and
references found were to the “Great Mother Goddess”. The same Mother
Goddess who was very active in Old European civilisations. Little statues
and figurines of this celestial deity were scattered all over the Indus
Valley, Western Asia and even the Aegean. I am of the firm belief that
these statues represented the goddess of love and war, Inanna or Ishtar as
she was known to her Anunnaki godly family.
A most fascinating link to the creation of Humankind comes to us in
t h e Laws of Manu. This ‘revealed scripture’ comprises 2,684 verses,
divided into 12 chapters presenting the norms of domestic, social, and
religious life in India. There is some disagreement among scholars about
the exact date when these scriptures were first penned. Some scholars
date it back as far as 1500 BC, others place it at 500 BC and some say
that it is a copy of much earlier writings only captured around 200 AD.
Regardless of the date, the Laws of Manu or ‘Manava Dharma Shastra’ is
one of the standard books in the Hindu canon, and a basic text for all
gurus to base their teachings on. It is fundamental to the understanding ofancient Indian society and traditionally accepted as one of the
supplementary arms of the Vedas. But what interests me most are verses
16 - 29 of Chapter 1. As you will see below, the description of the
‘creation of mankind’ is uncannily close to the descriptions in the
Sumerian tablets. How is that possible, unless there was a very close link
to the Sumerian gods by one of their representatives in the Indus Valley.
There were many gods in the valley organising the rise of that civilisation
from thousands of years BC. So it should not surprise us to see this kind
of sharing of knowledge. Manu's text clearly suggests some kind of
genetic engineering, DNA splicing and other biological manipulation by
the gods when they were creating mankind. This is an extract from
Chapter 1 - The Laws of Manu translated by G. Buhler:
But, joining minute particles even of those six, which possess
“16.
measureless power, with particles of himself, he created all beings.
Because those six (kinds of) minute particles, which form the
17. (creator's) frame, enter (a-sri) these (creatures), therefore the wise
call his frame sarira, (the body).
That the great elements enter, together with their functions and the
18. mind, through its minute parts the framer of all beings, the
imperishable one.
But from minute body (framing) particles of these seven very
19. powerful Purushas springs this (world), the perishable from the
imperishable.
Among them each succeeding (element) acquires the quality of the
20. preceding one, and whatever place (in the sequence) each of them
occupies, even so many qualities it is declared to possess.
But in the beginning he assigned their several names, actions, and
21. conditions to all (created beings) even according to the words of the
Veda.
He, the Lord, also created the class of the gods, who are endowed
22. with life, and whose nature is action; and the subtile class of the
Sadhyas, and the eternal sacrifice.Whatever he assigned to each at the (first) creation, noxiousness or
harmlessness, gentleness or ferocity, virtue or sin, truth or
29. falsehood, that clung (afterwards) spontaneously to it.” (Were the
seven Purushas the same seven Sumerian birth-mothers that gave
birth to the first Homo sapiens?)
Much has been written about the origins of writing in the world. One of
the strongly argued topics is the origin of the Vedic scripts. While most
will contest with all their might that they cannot have existed in written
form all those thousands of years ago, long before writing was invented,
there are some strong arguments in favour of such a possibility. Is it at all
possible that over 1,000 Vedic poems could have survived thousands of
years without having been written down? It seems highly unlikely. But
Humankind only started to write around 4000 BC in the Near East, and
3400 BC in the Indus Valley. How could the Vedic poems have been
written down if human kind could not write yet? Just because no writing
material had been excavated in India does not mean that they could not
write.
Ellie Crystal from the remarkable www.crystalinks.com website has
presented a very strong argument showing that it may actually be
possible for the Vedic literature to have been written down long before
the time of the accepted emergence of writing in the world. Rig Veda is
accepted as the oldest existing literature available to humans. It seems to
be older than the Ramayan of at least 5500 BC and some internal proto-
Hindu evidence takes it as far back as 23,000 BC. Other scholars place it
at around 8000 BC. The point is that they must have written all that
literature down in some way, because it is highly improbable that they
could have memorised such a vast amount of work. There are a number of
references which allude to the art of writing in the Rig Veda. Some of the
references state that the seers “inscribed or engraved” words on certain
materials, suggesting that they knew how to write. The Rig Veda 1-164-
39 states that “In the letters (akshara) of the verses of the Veda...”.
The Rig Vedic texts consists of a large number of compositional
‘chandas’, which are very specific spatial arrangements of the lines in ametre, and to complicate it even more, a specific number of words per
line. It would take a tremendous amount of mental effort to compose and
memorise so much material with all the specific intricacies involved. So
unless these were reduced to writing and given a specific concrete shape,
it would not have been possible to transfer it orally.
Yet another verse of Rig Veda 10-62-7 mentions how cows were
marked “by an 8-eight” which clearly shows that the ancients possessed
the knowledge of writing.
Rig Veda 10-71-4 refers to a language which can be “seen”, meaning that
it must have been in written script. If there was no written script at the
time, surely they would have used the verb ‘to pronounce or say’ rather
than ‘to inscribe/write’? The only plausible reason for choosing to use
these words, was because a written form of language existed during that
time.
The art of writing was prevalent even during the Mahabharat era as the
verb 'lekhi' or ‘writing’ in all its forms like ‘lekhako, lekhani’ and others,
appears numerous times in the Mahabharat text (Aadi 1.77/78). Their
arrows were inscribed with the names of specific persons to whom they
belonged. Distinction was made between “to write” and “to read” in
Harivansha texts, indicating to us that ‘what was written, was also being
read’.
How could a text with over 100,000 verses be composed, preserved and
transmitted through memory alone? I say it's impossible. You may
believe otherwise. But while such an incredible feat may have been
performed by a few, it does not suggest that the art of writing was not
developed.
The Atharvasheersha from the Upanishads scriptures symbolises Shree
Ganesh as an ‘omkar’which is a combination of ‘g-aakar, m-aakar’. How
could a syllable which was transmitted ‘ONLY ORALLY’ have an
‘aakar’or ‘shape’?
In the Mahabharat text from circa 3100 BC there are quotes from Rishi
Vasistha of the Ramayanic Era (at least 5500 BC) which include the
expressions 'granth' or ‘manuscript’. If writing skills were not acquired at
the time, how is it possible that they would discuss the issues surroundingvarious manuscripts?
The Yujurvedic Taittiriya Samhita and also the Atharvaveda utilize the
word “likha” to ‘write’. Although these scriptures are not as ancient as
the Rig Veda, it shows that the art of writing was known by ancient Vedic
peoples since remote times. R.N. Dandekar remarks, “There is, indeed,
considerable circumstantial and inferential character which enables us to
perceive the existence of writing even in the very early periods of Indian
cultural history. It is true that the Veda has been handed down from
generation to generation through oral tradition. It must not, however, be
supposed that on that account, as is often erroneously done, that the art of
writing was unknown in the early Vedic age. The practice of oral
transmission of Veda was adopted, not because written copies of these
texts were not available, but presumably because it was believed that oral
transmission alone was more conducive to the preservation of the magic-
religious potency and the formal protection of those arts.”
Let's take a look at some examples of the Vedic Hymns/Poems to see
what possible connections there may have been between the ancient Indus
civilisation and the Anunnaki gods of Sumer. In this first example, which
is the Samaveda Decade 1 Agni, we deal with so many of the same issues
that the Sumerian tablets have captured, it is truly uncanny. We read
about visible deities among men, dwelling places in the sky, gods of
violence and gods of material reward. This could have been a poem
recited by a Sumerian faithful:
Samaveda - DECADE I Agni:
“Come, Agni, praised with song, to feast and sacrificial offering: sit
As Hotar on the holy grass!
O Agni, thou hast been ordained Hotar of every sacrifice,
By Gods, among the race of men.
Agni we choose as envoy, skilled performer of this holy rite,
Hotar, possessor of all wealth.
Served with oblation, kindled, bright, through love of song may
Agni, bent
On riches, smite the Vritras dead!
I laud your most beloved guest like a dear friend, O Agni, himWho, like a chariot, wins us wealth.
Do thou, O Agni, with great might guard us from all malignity,
Yea, from the hate of mortal man!
O Agni, come; far other songs of praise will I sing forth to thee.
Wax mighty with these Soma-drops!
May Vatsa draw thy mind away even from thy loftiest dwelling
place!
Agni, I yearn for thee with song.
Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the sky, the head
Of all who offer sacrifice.
O Agni, bring us radiant light to be our mighty succour, for Thou art
our visible deity!”
Because there are 1,028 of these poems and every single one carries some
sort of link to our Sumerian ancestry and the gods who flew around in
their chariots, brandishing their weapons, I will only quote the
appropriate few lines from a small number of Vedic poems to
demonstrate my point.
Samaveda - DECADE VAgni:
(Weapons with flames, travel to the sky, material wealth, blessing from
the sky.)
“Hence have these men gone up on high and mounted to the heights
of heaven:
On! conquer on the path by which Angirasas travelled to the skies!
That thou mayst send us ample wealth,
Shoot forth, O Agni, with thy flame: demolish them on every side!
Break down the Yatudhana's strength, the vigour of the Rakshasa!
Worship the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras and Adityas, all
Who know fair sacrifices, sprung from Man, scattering blessings
down!”
Samaveda - DECADE IV Indra:
(Black drop in the heart resembles the story of Mohammed at birth. This
had something to do with immortality or reviving someone from the dead.
Sumerian tablets are also filled with similar content of resurrection bythe flying gods.)
“The black drop sank in Ansumati's bosom, advancing with ten
thousand round about it.
Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted King
laid down his weapons.
Flying in terror from the snort of Vritra all deities who were thy
friends forsook thee.
So, Indra, with the Maruts be thy friendship: in all these battles thou
shalt be the victor.
The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his
circling course with many round him.
Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died
yesterday to-day is living…”
III Indra - Brihaspati:
(The following Samavedas are filled with references to war, flames,
heavenly hosts, violence, anger and more.)
“Indra, pitiless hero with unbounded anger,
Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless-may he protect our armies in
our battles!
And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts that
conquer and demolish!
Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna the Maruts,
and Adityas!
Uplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, heightened Gods who
cause the worlds to tremble.”
IV Indra - Maruts:
“Bristle thou up, O Maghavan, our weapons: excite the spirits, of my
warring heroes!
Urge on the strong steed's might, O Vyitra-slayer, and let the din of
conquering cars go Upward…”
VIII Soma - Varuna:
(This sounds similar to the ‘angels’ who came to destroy Sodom andGomorrah. They struck the aggressors down with blindness first.)
“With immortality King Soma clothe thee!
Blind, O my foemen, shall ye be, even as headless serpents are
May Indra slay each best of you when Agni's flame hath struck you
down!”
Hymn LXXXV - Maruts:
(Gods delight in offerings of food; fly to the heavens; Tvastar makes a
weapon for Indra)
“The Maruts have made heaven and Earth increase and grow: in
sacrifices they delight, the strong and wild.
The Rudras have established their abode in heaven… they shine in
bright attire, and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments,
They drive away each adversary from their path,
When ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer, urging the
thunderbolt,
Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet
pinions.
Come ye forward with your arms.
Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight
yourselves,
O Maruts, in the pleasant food.
Before the Maruts every creature is afraid: the men are like to Kings,
terrible to behold.
When Tvastar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt, golden, with
thousand edges, fashioned more skilfully, Indra received it to
perform heroic deeds.”
Hymn XIV - Visvedevas:
(Rocket ships with flaming red rockets of fire?)
“Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping
holy oil,
Bring the Gods to the Soma draught.
With all the Gods, with Indra, with Vayu, and Mitra's splendours,
drink,Agni, the pleasant Soma juice.
Harness the Red Mares to thy car, the Bays, O God, the flaming
ones: With those bring hitherward the Gods.”
Hymn XXI - Indra-Agni:
(Could ‘spacious view’ be referring to the heaven in the sky above?)
“Watch ye, through this your truthfulness, there in the place of
spacious view Indra and Agni, send us bliss.”
Hymn LXXXVIII - Maruts:
“COME hither, Maruts, on your lightning laden cars, sounding with
sweet songs, armed with lances, winged with steeds.
Fly unto us with noblest food, like birds, O ye of mighty power.
With their red-hued or, haply, tawny coursers which speed their
chariots on, they come for glory.
Brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder. Earth have they
smitten with the chariot's felly.”
This next poem is an astounding piece, which virtually paraphrases the
clay tablets of Sumer, outlining the marriage between gods and mortal
humans, creating more civilised humans, who were taught all the skills
they needed by the gods to provide the global population with the food
they so badly needed. This new breed of humans were also the future
kings, priests and pharaohs of Egypt with more power than mere mortals.
They were the mouthpieces of the gods, delivering messages to the
people. They often thought of themselves as gods.
Hymn CLIX - Heaven and Earth:
“I PRAISE with sacrifices mighty Heaven and Earth at festivals, the
wise, the Strengtheners of Law.
Who, having Gods for progeny, conjoined with Gods, through
wonderworking wisdom bring forth choicest boons.
With invocations, on the gracious Father's mind, and on the Mother's
great inherent power I muse.
Prolific Parents, they have made the world of life, and for their
brood all round wide immortality.These Sons of yours well skilled in work, of wondrous power,
brought forth to life the two great Mothers first of all.
To keep the truth of all that stands and all that moves, ye guard the
station of your Son who knows no guile.
They with surpassing skill, most wise, have measured out the Twins
united in their birth and in their home.
They, the refulgent (brilliant) Sages, weave within the sky, yea, in
the depths of sea, a web for ever new.
This is to-day the goodliest gift of Savitar: this thought we have
when now the God is furthering us.
On us with loving-kindness Heaven and Earth bestow riches and
various wealth and treasure hundredfold!”
Hymn XC - Visvedevas:
(Benevolent gods who reward their faithful; immortal gods.)
“For they are dealers forth of wealth, and, not deluded, with their
might Guard evermore the holy laws.
Shelter may they vouchsafe to us, Immortal Gods to mortal men,
Chasing our enemies away.
May they mark out our paths to bliss, Indra, the Maruts, Pusan, and
Bhaga, the Gods to be adored.
Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.”
Hymn LXXXI - Indra:
(This poem is very reminiscent of the rewards which god promised his
chosen people, or individuals like Abraham and Moses, if they went to
war and did what was commanded. God would promise great riches and
rewards to those who obeyed, but punished those who did not. This was
not only restricted as punishment for ‘sin’ but also rewards for actually
performing required tasks for god.)
“THE men have lifted Indra up, the Vrtra slayer, to joy and strength:
Him, verily, we invocate in battles whether great or small: be he our
aid in deeds of might.
Thou, Hero, art a warrior, thou art giver of abundant spoil.
Strengthening e'en the feeble, thou aidest the sacrificer, thou givestthe offerer ample wealth.
When war and battles are on foot, booty is laid before the bold
Whom wilt thou slay and whom enrich? Do thou, O Indra, make us
rich.
Mighty through wisdom, as he lists, terrible, he hath waxed in
strength.
Lord of Bay Steeds, strong-jawed, sublime, he in joined hands for
glory's sake hath grasped his iron thunderbolt.
He filled the Earthly atmosphere and pressed against the lights in
heaven.
None like thee ever hath been born, none, Indra, will be born like
thee.
Thou hast waxed mighty over all.”
Hymn LXXXIX - Visvedevas:
(There is no doubt that the gods of the Indus Valley were as unpredictable
as the gods of Sumer. The people never knew what kind of mood they were
in, or what exactly they should do to please them, not invoking their
wrath. They even tried to befriend the gods.)
“MAY powers auspicious come to us from every side, never
deceived,
unhindered, and victorious,
That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians day
by day unceasing in their care.
May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us descend the
bounty of the righteous Gods.
The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so may the
Gods extend our life that we may live.”
Hymn XXII - Asvins and Others:
(A clear reference to a chariot which reaches the heaven and we also
read that the gods travelled far and wide over the world. There must have
been times when the ‘gods’ were not present in India, but rather in the
distant ‘seven regions’ of the world as they say. But the ‘gods’ mostly
stayed up in the heavens.)“We call the Asvins Twain, the Gods borne in a noble car, the best
Of charioteers, who reach the heavens.
The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Visnu
strode
Through the seven regions of the Earth!
Through all this world strode Visnu; thrice his foot he planted, and
the whole
Was gathered in his footstep's dust.
The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Visnu is,
Laid as it were an eye in heaven.”
Hymn CLXXXVI - Visvedevas:
(God's chariots with missiles and mighty weapons; humans wanted to stay
among the gods, in their areas; but humans were still slaves of the gods
and toiling for them in many ways.)
“As on a fair bright day the arrow flieth o'er all the barren soil their
missiles sparkle.
…For power and might have they, their own possession. This is my
reverent thought of you, ye Holy; may it inspire you, make you
dwell among us,
…Toiling for the Gods and seeking treasure. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.”
Hymn XXIII - Brahmanaspati:
(No harm will come to those who bring gifts to the gods and worship
them.)
“The awful car, Brhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves
the stall of kine, and finds the light.
Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress
o'ertakes not him who offers gifts to thee.
Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Brhaspati, quelling his wrath:
herein is thy great mightiness.
Brhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who
fain would injure us.
Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who havescorned thee in thy manifested might.
Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy
the evil speakers, O Brhaspati.”
Hymn LXXV - Dawn:
(Just as in the Sumerian tablets, here we discover that there were mortals
who did have sex with goddesses, or the other way around. ‘When the
sons of the gods saw the daughters of man and had sex and children with
them.’ But the Indian culture was driven by Inanna/Ishtar, goddess of
love and war. It is evident from the poems that she was highly sexed and
ready to fight at the drop of a hat. She wanted things to be done her way
in the lands that were given to her by god Enlil.)
“BORN in the heavens the Dawn hath flushed, and showing her
majesty is come as Law ordaineth.
She hath uncovered fiends and hateful darkness; best of Angirases,
hath waked the pathways.
Rouse us this day to high and happy fortune: to great felicity…
Vouchsafe us manifold and splendid riches, famed among mortals,
man-befriending Goddess!
She yokes her chariot far away, and swiftly visits the lands where the
Five Tribes are settled,
Looking upon the works and ways of mortals, Daughter of Heaven,
the world's Imperial Lady.
On her all-lovely car she comes, the Fair One, and brings rich
treasure for her faithful servant.
True with the True and Mighty with the Mighty, with Gods a
Goddess, Holy with the Holy,”
Rig Vedas - Vayu & Others:
(We often hear of thunder when the gods come down from the skies. That
would not be surprising since their ‘rocket ships’ would make a lot of
noise. It is also described when they go to battle and the gods are with
them, slaying their foes with their mighty space ships.)
“Fierce comes the Maruts' thundering voice, like that of conquerors,
when ye go forward to victory, O Men.Born of the laughing lightning… may the Maruts guard us
everywhere May they be gracious unto Us.”
Hymn C - Visnu:
(Immortality among the gods was greatly admired by humans, who all
desired it. In the Sumerian tablets we also read about the large homes or
dwellings in places which were out of bounds to humans, which the gods
built for themselves, often admired by humans. Sometimes the gods would
go away into the sky, other times to their splendid dwellings on Earth.)
“Foremost be Visnu, stronger than the strongest: for glorious is his
name who lives for ever.
Over this Earth with mighty step strode Visnu, ready to give it for a
home to Manu.
In him the humble people trust for safety: he, nobly born, hath made
them spacious dwellings.
Yea, I the poor and weak praise thee the Mighty who dwellest in the
realm beyond this region. May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee.
Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.”
Hymn CLXXXV - Heaven and Earth:
(Humans were generally impressed by the ancient gods. They were
beautiful, they lived forever, they could fly away in their thundering ships
of the sky and they had mighty weapons. They could appear any place,
any time, without warning.)
“How were they born? Who knoweth it, ye sages?
These of themselves support all things existing:
The Twain uphold, though motionless and footless, a widespread
offspring having feet and moving.
… protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.
May we be close to both the Worlds who suffer no pain, Parents of
Gods, who aid with favour,
Both mid the Gods, with Day and Night alternate.
Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.
Faring together, young, with meeting limits, Twin Sisters lying in
their Parents' bosom,Kissing the centre of the world together.
Who, beautiful to look on, make the nectar.
Wide, vast, and manifold, whose bounds are distant, these, reverent,
I address at this our worship,
May both these Friends of man, who bless, preserve me, may they
attend me with their help and favour.
Enrich the man more liberal than the godless. May we, ye Gods, be
strong with food rejoicing.
I have uttered this truth, for all to hear, to Earth and Heaven.
Be near us, keep us from reproach and trouble.
Nearest of Gods be ye with your protection.”
Judaism. Origin circa 2,000 BC.
Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people and can be traced back to the
Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt. But Judaism, Christianity, Islam and
the Baha'i faith all share Abraham as their founding father sometime
around 2050 BC. This original development is marked by the divine
covenant that was made between god and the ancient Israelites. Moses
was the next leader of the Israelites, and probably the first ‘real’ Jewish
leader, who led his people out of captivity in Egypt and received the ‘Law
from God’. Then Joshua led them into the promised land where Samuel
established the Israelite kingdom with Saul as its first king. King David
established Jerusalem and King Solomon built the first temple there. But
the history of the Jews is a tragic one. These chosen people of god have
been in a perpetual state of conflict since the very first book of the Bible.
In 70 AD the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jews were
scattered throughout the world until 1948 when the state of Israel was
formed. Jews believe in one creator who alone is to be worshipped as
absolute ruler of the universe. He monitors people's activities and
rewards good deeds and punishes the evil ones. This is the ‘god of
vengeance’ of the Old Testament. The Jewish holy book is the Hebrew
Bible, which is a collection of books which were written over a period of
about 1,000 years and established in its full canonical form by the end of
the first century AD. It is divided into three sections. The Torah, TheProphets and the Writings. The Torah, which consists of the first five
books of the Bible, was apparently written by Moses, by divine
instruction from God himself and cannot be changed. How convenient. A
perfect example of the manipulative nature of the ‘god of vengeance’.
Just command the people not to question and not to touch, otherwise they
will be punished. The same old story that has plagued Humankind from
the very beginning. Throughout their history, God would communicate
with the Jewish people through prophets, high priests and sometimes
even through oracles and oracle stones. The actual origin of the prophetic
experience is not clear, but a prophet was simply anyone who believed
himself to be summoned by God to preach his message. Some of these
prophets became very powerful people, who held the attention of their
fellow Jews without question. We can assume that there were many other
prophets besides the more popular ones, who were less admired. The
prophetic experience could range from the obscure mystical visions of an
Ezekiel, to the clear ethical convictions of Amos. The word ‘Jehovah’ is a
medieval misreading and does not appear in the Hebrew Bible.
Jews believe in the inherent goodness of the world and its inhabitants
as creations of God and do not require a saviour to save them from
original sin. They believe that they are God's chosen people and that their
Messiah will arrive in the future, gather them into Israel, where there will
be a general resurrection of the dead, and the Jerusalem Temple will be
rebuilt. This is a beautiful fairytale which belongs squarely in the realms
of mythology. But somehow this naïve version of the evolution of
Humankind escaped the historians' wrath, and remained a divine religion,
never to be associated with the heathen behaviour of those who
worshipped the Sumerian gods just a short time before. You may be
surprised to find that the Jews may be a little unsure of the whole truth.
Because even the Hebrews had different names for different gods, which
once again resemble the ‘heavenly gods’ of the Sumerians who came
before them. The scriptures mention only a few, like Shad-dai, which
seemed to represent the storm god; also Elo'ah; Yah; Adonai and Elohim.
But if they had these few gods pretty clearly identified, there must have
been others. The most important one was ‘YHWH’ (pronounced asYAHWEH), generally taking on the meaning of ‘Lord’ and eventually
became Jehovah. This word was apparently not pronounced by the early
Hebrew priests because it was deemed to be the unpronounceable name of
god. If you spend a while contemplating all the strange coincidences, you
will begin to see the underlying common thread of the prehistoric
Sumerian gods and the Anunnaki deities, who settled on Earth long
before all this confusion among the humans began. As much as the Jews
like to present a strong unified front, their religion has had many sects
and cults over a 3,000 year period. From the Essenes of Jesus' days, who
had very strong ties with the Aryans of Persia, to the Cabalists and the
Karaites of the 8thcentury AD, who regarded themselves as ‘Children of
the Scripture’, and only adhered to the five books of Moses and in
addition they practised much stricter rules in their lives. The
transformation from Hebraism to Judaism happened during the periods
some time before the birth of Christ, to around 200 AD, by which time
the writings of the Mishnah (set of six orders outlining the basis of
Jewish law) were completed. It was a long and slow process from which
Biblical Hebraism emerged as rabbinic Judaism.
Zoroastrianism. Origin circa 1000 BC.
From the north eastern parts of Iran, what was then known as Persia,
emerged a prophet called by the Greek name of Zoroaster. His real name
was Zarathushtra, and the religious faith that emerged from his teachings
became known as Zoroastrianism. He preached what may have been the
first monotheistic belief in a single supreme god, Lord Ahura Mazda,
who was completely removed from evil. Ahura Mazda can be translated
to mean ‘god of Light’, which would be in line with Sumerian
descriptions of their gods, describing them as “radiant” and “shining like
the light of the sun” and it instantly makes me think that Zoroaster must
have encountered this ‘bright’ god who appeared from the west. The
Sumerian gods were jostling for position, Marduk was forcing his will on
the Egyptians and according to the tablets, also on the rest of Humankind
everywhere, propagating the message that ‘he’ was the ‘god above all’.
Until this point the gods of prehistory were ruling their lands collectivelyand were being worshipped fanatically by mortal humans. The people
were protected by these localised gods who in turn had a closely
developed relationship with their master-gods.
We should not be surprised to learn that Zoroaster's teachings were so
controversial and caused so much resistance, that Zoroaster had to flee
for his life. A ‘single supreme god’ philosophy did not go down well in
those days when the gods of ancient times were in control of the world.
Zoroastrians believe in the dualism of good and evil as either a cosmic
one between Ahura Mazda and an evil spirit of violence and death, Angra
Mainyu, or as an ethical dualism within the human consciousness. The
Holy Spirit establishes life and creates men and women. The Zoroastrian
holy book is called the Avesta which includes the teachings of
Zarathushtra written in a series of seventeen hymns called the Gathas.
Although they were difficult to translate, his love for god was striking. It
is a collection of abstract, sacred poetry, directed towards the worship of
the one god; understanding of righteousness and cosmic order; promotion
of social justice; harmony and individual choice between good and evil.
Zoroastrians worship through prayers and symbolic ceremonies that are
conducted before a sacred fire which symbolises their god. They dedicate
their lives to a three-fold path represented by their motto: “Good
thoughts, good words, good deeds.” They also teach that the ‘System,
Order, Principle and Rule’ which is to be seen in heaven, must be
implemented on Earth. But he was also prepared to use the imagery of
judgement at the point of death. Later Zoroastrians in the 9th century AD
disagreed with the propaganda of the Christians and Muslims, so they
wrote a set of books to defend their “Good Religion”. While the holy
book of Zoroastrians was probably only written down in the 5thcentury
AD, its roots go back a long way, many years before Zoroaster himself.
But just like the other religions, and even though Zoroaster preached the
supremacy of one god, there was an additional group of gods which
surrounded the supreme one. And suddenly the whole Zoroastrian belief
system joins all the others that actually submitted to a ‘leading’ god, who
was master of several lesser gods. Zoroastrians had six ‘BounteousImmortals’ who sat before the throne of god possessing special powers.
They could be compared to what the Bible calls ‘angels’. Furthermore
they believe that the world and all material things belong to God, while
the devil and evil can only exist in an immaterial world, like a parasite,
constantly trying to destroy God's world.
The basic elements of original Iranian religion, are the traditional
Aryan faith and the teachings of Zoroaster. So much so, that during the
reign of Darius and Xerxes, Zoroastrianism was a strong influence in the
courts. He was also respected in Greece at the time of Plato. And just like
all the other religions, it has its own set of sects, cults and off-shoots
which have evolved with time. We must remember that the Three Wise
Men who visited Jesus at birth came from the east, and were called Magi.
Zoroastrian priests were known as Magi, whose job it was to look after
their religion.
Buddhism. Origin circa 560 to 490 BC.
After digesting thousands of pages in an effort to get a broader
understanding of global religions, their origins and how they all fit into
the Great Human Puzzle, I reached the conclusion that Siddhartha
Gautama Buddha (Sanskrit version) was the first real rebel in the world
of religion. The founder of what is today called Buddhism, began to
question the meaning of life, the futility of life, why men are born only to
suffer sickness and hardship and eventually death.
With his new philosophies he basically flew in the face of what the
other religions of his time were teaching. Most of what we know about
the Buddha is derived mainly from canonical texts written mainly in Pali,
an ancient language of India. Those who practise this faith in its native
home call it Buddha-sasana, which could be best translated as ‘the way of
life’ or ‘discipline of the Awakened one’. It is also known as the
‘Buddha-Dhamma’ meaning ‘the eternal truth of the Awakened one’. The
young Gautama grew up in a hill town called Kapilavastu, which is in
Nepal of today, being highly inspired by bald, wandering, ‘holy men’
known as ‘shramanas’, who devoted themselves to the pursuit of an
ascetic life. That meant no sex, no personal pleasure of a material kind,and a total devotion to spiritualism. These bald wanderers were in search
of answers to the futility of life and in a sense were the proto-Buddhists
who showed Gautama the way. He was determined to find a solution to
the problems of human existence.
The difference between the Buddhists and Brahmins who lived in India
during those days was mainly in their sacrificial rituals, which were
rather elitist and excluded most of the common people. He joined a group
of shramanas, mastered the art of meditation while in search of spiritual
truth but in the course of his pursuit he was reduced to skin and bone, and
almost died. He realised that this was not the way forward. Some time
later he found himself in the province of Ganges where he was engaged
by Mara, the ‘Evil One’ and his three daughters, who tried everything in
their power to deflect the Buddha-to-be from his purpose.
After a night of spiritual struggle in about 535 BC, he became “The
Awakened” and entered a supposed state of transcendental being.
Buddhists disregarded the Indian caste system of segregating classes,
they accepted all humans as equal. And so the enlightened and Awakened
Gautama Buddha began to preach the Dharma. The Buddhists call it “The
Discourse of the Setting in Motion the Wheels of Dharma.” He travelled
and preached for 40 years, during which he established the Order of the
Buddhist Brethren and Order of Sisters. It is also written that he was
confronted several times by ‘Mara the Evil One’, but Gautama defeated
him each time. When he died in 490 BC, his body was cremated seven
days after his death. Buddhists believe in reincarnation and that one must
go through several cycles of birth, life and death. After a number of such
cycles, if a person releases their attachment to desire and the self, they
can attain Nirvana. In general, Buddhists do not believe in any type of
god, the need for a saviour, prayer, or eternal life after death.
From the Gospel of Buddha as written by Paul Carus we learn that one
of the major philosophies the Buddha taught was, “Truth knows neither
birth nor death; it has no beginning and no end… Truth gives unto
mortals the boon of immortality.”
So it seems that just like all the other religions, the pages of the
Buddhist scriptures are filled by the obsession with immortality. In somereligions it would be described as life after death. By now we have
established that this idea originated from the Sumerian gods dating back
to the flood some 11,000 BC and their interaction with the humans who
survived. But as time passed their fascination with eternal life evolved
into a variety of obsessions, many of which manifested themselves in the
number of religious denominations which emerged. We learn further that
“karma is undeniable… Like everything in nature, the life of man is
subject to the laws of cause and effect.” Buddha felt strongly about the
vanity of religious ritual. He had a whole new approach to life, clearly
very influenced by the interactions between the many gods of prehistory
and the control they exerted on Humankind, while demanding to be
worshipped. He resisted it strongly and desperately wanted to free
Humankind from the stranglehold of the Sumerian gods. “Rituals have no
efficacy; prayers are vain repetitions and incantations have no saving
power.”
The teachings of Christ resemble the words of the Buddha in so many
ways, that it seems impossible that the two are coincidental. “What love
can a man possess who believes that the destruction of life will atone for
evil deeds? Can a new wrong expiate old wrongs? And can the slaughter
of an innocent victim blot out the evil deeds of mankind? Purify your
hearts and cease to kill, that is true religion.” (Gospel of Buddha.)
I found this gospel quite uplifting in the early days of 2005. It is filled
with constant repetition regarding “brotherly love towards your
enemies”; the great circle of fate which may turn the victor into the
victim; reconciliation; truth and so on. It is the kind of wisdom we hear
from peacemakers like Nelson Mandela on a regular basis, but I cannot
recall Mandela ever proclaiming to be a Buddhist. “Come now and make
peace, let us be brothers; he will gain a victory that is not a transient
success, for its fruits will remain forever.” The Buddha believed that
humans will not be reborn into suffering or lower forms of life or
continue a karma of evil deeds, if they followed the appropriate steps
toward enlightenment. We are assured of “final salvation”. It is not quite
clear what that ‘final salvation’ might be, as we read on: “When they die,
nothing will remain of them but their good thoughts, their righteous acts,and the bliss that proceeds from truth and righteousness.”
But as with all the other religions, even Buddhism refers to the
influence and involvement of the ancient gods. In this case however, it
seems that the Buddha actually stood up to the violent gods of Sumer and
the Old Testament, in an attempt to show them the way of peace and
enlightenment. In the book of The Mirror of Truth (from the Gospel of
Buddha) it refers very clearly to such interaction between the Buddha and
the gods; and men. “The Fully enlightened one; the wise; upright…The
Bridler of men's wayward hearts; the teacher of Gods and men; the
blessed Buddha.” Those gods of ancient times just happened to pop up
everywhere. Are we still so sure that they were mythological figures? If
we accept the Buddha as a real historic figure, should we not also accept
the ‘gods’ of Sumer and all the latter cultures as real historical deities,
although it goes against what we think we know? As vague as the so-
called ‘salvation’ which the Buddha refers to may be, his teachings
overflow with the unbridled embrace of truth and love. It is staggering to
see how completely opposed by nature it is, to the brutal tales of violence
which we read in the Bible and other religious scriptures like the Koran.
But guess what? That mysterious shiny metal called gold, pops its head
out even on the pages of the Gospel of Buddha. Where there was gold,
there were the signs of the Anunnaki gods who controlled all of it. We
read that even the Buddha was pleased to receive a robe of golden thread
from a man of a lower caste. The most fascinating link to our gods of
Sumer is beautifully revealed in the story of Buddha's birth. His mother
was referred to as the “Queen of Heaven… beautiful as a water lily and
pure in mind as the lotus”. She had a complexion bright and light, like
many of the Sumerian goddesses as described in the clay tablets. Those
were the days when humans were intermarrying with ‘Nefilim gods’ as
we are told in the Bible and the Sumerian tablets. We were also shown
that the Egyptian kings were required to be half human, half god. The
Gospel of Buddha states that her husband the King “honoured her in her
holiness”. Was the Buddha another one of the chosen prophets of the
Anunnaki gods in an attempt to keep Humankind in line? And was he the
son of a mortal king and a beautiful Anunnaki ‘goddess’? Would thisheritage have given the Buddha superior knowledge to perform his role as
a leader among men? There is ample written evidence that seems to
suggest this very convincingly.
Once again we have the involvement of ‘angels’ at the point of
conception or birth, as it seems to have happened with all the ancient
prophets. When the Buddha's mother was about to give birth, she went for
a walk in the garden. Four “pure-minded angels” appeared out of the blue
and helped her bring the child into the world. The angels took the child,
placed it in front of the mother and said: “Rejoice O queen, a mighty son
has been born unto thee.” This was followed by a very similar event
surrounding the birth of Christ. In that story, when Joseph returned to the
cave with a midwife, the cave was ‘filled with light brighter than the
sun’. The place surrounding the newly born Buddha experienced a similar
event. “All the worlds were flooded with light.”
It certainly seems that the Anunnaki gods were there in greater
numbers, observing the event and ‘shining some light on the subject’.
Even the Buddha referred to ‘Heaven’ as being up in the sky. Why is
that? Is it because that is where the gods would descend from and return
to every now and then? “… One who looks up and spits at heaven; the
spittle soils not the Heaven, but comes back and defiles his own person.”
But, just like all the other religions, there are many sects and cults in
Buddhism. The two main ones are Theravada Buddhism which is
practised in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Kampuchea and Laos, while the other is
Mahayana Buddhism practised mainly in China, Korea and Japan. In
China we encounter Ch'an Buddhism and in Japan, Zen Buddhism, which
are derivatives of the original Buddhist teachings introduced into China
by an Indian monk called Bodhidharm around 500 AD. But Zen
Buddhism in Japan only really took root in 1191 AD when a monk called
Eisai established the first Rinzai school of Zen. Anew form of Buddhism
called Shingon, began to emerge in Japan under the influence of Kukai
who was born in 774 AD and is now regarded as the person responsible
for the merging of Buddhism and Shinto, which became the feature of
Japanese religion. But the concepts of compassion and salvation were
much greater features of this new form of Buddhism, from whichcompassion and faith began to emerge as the most important tenets of the
faith. Shinran was born in 1173, and later established Jodo Shinshu ‘The
Pure Land Sect’. He became consumed with the struggle between the
‘good man’ and the ‘evil man’ in many ways absorbing much of
Christianity. The subtle undertones of a place like ‘heaven’ is referred to
in his teachings. “Even a bad man will be received in Buddha's land.”
There is one other fascinating aspect of the Buddhists that may have
linked them to the Anunnaki for hundreds of thousands of years.
Buddhists believe that a new Buddha comes along about every 5,000
years and the Buddhist tradition has a list of at least 24 Buddhas who
preceded Buddha Gautama. This would give us a path of some 120,000
years back in time, approaching the origins of Humankind about 200,000
years ago. Is it possible that the human resistance to the Anunnaki
masters' oppressive control over them could have begun so very long
ago? This is obviously too much for any modern historian to digest, but
the legends carry some overwhelming traditions and facts that will be
very difficult to disprove or to come to terms with.
Shinto. Origin circa 500+ BC.
Ancient Japanese civilisation and their earliest semblances of religion,
are truly fascinating, bearing instantly visible links to the prehistoric
Anunnaki of the Sumerian tablets. The Japanese tradition talks about the
age of ‘Kami’ which began with the emergence of the cosmos out of
chaos, giving rise to the history of Humankind. The story continues with
Ningi, the grandchild of the Sun Kami, who descended to the lower
realms. It was his great grandson who later became the first emperor of
Japan. The Sumerian tablets talk about a very similar set of events
surrounding the creation of the heavens in the book of Enuma Elish (Epic
of Creation), the great celestial battle in the sky during which Earth was
created. After some time the Igigi, who were referred to as the “children
of the stars”, descended from heaven to “marry the daughters of man”
(Genesis) and in so-doing sped up the growth of the human population.
Marduk was the son of Enki, who was the first settler on Earth, and
destined to be the first commander of Earth. A further interesting thing isthat from about 660 BC to around 600 AD, the authority lay with women
rulers who acted as shamans or mediums. Could that be because the lands
which included Japan were bestowed upon Inanna, Sumerian goddess of
love and war, who was renowned for her enjoyment of wine, song and
poetry? She was a strong, determined ‘goddess’ who ruled over the Indus
Valley and spread her wings even further east as time went by. Japanese
prehistoric mythology seems to gently transform into history without
causing any ripples, claiming that Japan has a divine mission upon Earth.
Fortunately, from around the 6 th century AD, with the introduction of
Buddhism into Japan, there are written documents to draw upon.
Although Shinto was around before the arrival of Buddhism, they
developed side by side in Japan but Shinto inherited many diverse
influences from Mahayana Buddhists and other Indo-Chinese religions
seeping into the region. In 1549 the Christians arrived to teach the
heathens of Japan the story of their saviour. They were eventually banned
from doing so by the first Japanese anti-Christian legislation in 1587.
This caused the European powers to isolate Japan until Christian missions
resumed in 1859.
The exact origins of Shinto are very blurry. The word Shinto is not a
Japanese term, it was only coined in the 6thcentury AD to describe the
older religious tradition “The way of the Kami”. It is described as Japan’s
indigenous faith, similar to the many African indigenous faiths. Shinto is
a religion closely tied to nature, which recognises the existence of various
Kami, who are deities of nature. And once again we find immediate
parallels to the gods of Sumer; taking control of different aspects of life
and controlling Humankind in various ways. Their names may be
different, but their functions and influence certainly were not. Kami is
often translated as god, which is not really correct. Some Japanese
scholars go as far as saying it is impossible to define the word Kami.
Even Japanese people themselves do not have a clear idea regarding
Kami. They are simply aware of it intuitively. If we accept this kind of
logic, believing in something intuitively, should we not rethink our
arrogant approach towards the possible existence of the ancient Sumeriangods, who were certainly not ‘intuitive’ but well documented in hundreds
of thousands clay tablets? One Japanese scholar describes Kami as such.
“All things whatsoever which deserve to be dreaded and revered for the
extraordinary and pre-eminent powers which they possess, are called
Kami.” Shinto shrines are frequented by ‘miko’ who are female shrine
attendants, performing a ritual dance which symbolises the worshippers
of that specific shrine. Is it coincidence that the goddess Inanna was the
proponent of dance and music and such activities were also encouraged at
her temples in Mesopotamia thousands of years earlier?
Shinto has many deity gods. Two of the leading deities are Izanagi and
Izanami, who gave birth to the Japanese islands and whose children
became the deities of the various Japanese clans. One of their daughters,
Amaterasu (Sun Goddess), is the ancestress of the Imperial Family and is
regarded as the chief deity. All the Kami sustain and protect. They are not
seen as separate from humanity due to sin because humanity is “Kami's
Child”. Followers of Shinto desire peace and believe that all human life is
sacred. They revere ‘musuhi’, the Kami's creative and harmonising
powers, and aspire to have ‘makoto’ – sincerity or true heart. Morality is
based upon that which benefits the group. Shinto has four affirmations:
Tradition and The family is the main mechanism by which traditions
family:
are preserved.
Nature is sacred and natural objects are to be
Love of nature:
worshipped as sacred spirits.
Physical
They must take baths, wash their hands and rinse their
cleanliness:
mouth regularly.
‘Matsuri’:
A festival which honours the spirits.
The behaviour of Shinto people when entering a shrine is fascinating and
raises many questions about the origins of such unusual rituals. Once
again the similarity between Sumerian temple offerings and Shinto are
remarkable. We read in Sumerian tablets how particular those gods were
about their choice of food and drink, which they wanted to be offered in
their temples. They also wanted a comfortable bed, a garden with treesfor shade; a spring or rock pool with fresh water; a bath or cleansing area,
and all had to be kept clean, neat and tidy. The Shinto gods in their
shrines have obviously demanded a similar kind of service, which is
evident in the customs surrounding the entering of, and worshipping in
the shrines. You must wash your hands and mouth at a natural spring in
the shrine or a rock pool. You can make a petition, request or ask a
question, but it is preferred if you submit it in writing. Could this be so
that the ‘god’ did not actually have to be present while you lament about
your own hardship? You should present your offering, which in ancient
times was preferably food. Today it is more symbolic, often giving
money. Is it not amazing that the gods of Japan had the same
materialistic needs as the gods of Sumer?
Confucianism. Origin circa 500 BC.
China stands alone among the world's great civilisations, developing
almost in total isolation from the rest. It adds a deep mystery to the Great
Human Puzzle and is a real marvel to behold. The Chinese people speak a
language that has no affinities with any other language group. It is written
in a script invented by the Chinese themselves, and is unlike any other.
The script can be read all over China, irrespective of the dialect of the
speaker, because the script is ideographic and therefore ancient scripts
can be read with ease today. There are three major religions in China.
Confucianism and Taoism, which had been in existence for at least 500
years before Buddhism arrived from India. The influence of Western and
Indian cultures and religions caused new forms of neo-Confucianism and
neo-Taoism to emerge while many other cults and sects flourished. It is
important to remind Western readers that Confucianism and Taoism are
actually ‘chiao’, Chinese teachings, which are not specifically religious
doctrines as we would like to classify them in the West. The writers and
creators of these two philosophies have been regarded as the collective
cultural heritage of the Chinese.
Confucius or K'ung Fu Tzu was born in 551 BC in the state of Lu in
China. He travelled throughout China giving advice to its rulers. His
teachings and writings dealt with individual morality, ethics, and theproper exercise of political power. His sacred canonical works also
contain secular documents pre-dating Confucianism and have been the
mainstream of the Chinese educational curriculum for over 2000 years.
But it was only after the introduction of Buddhism into China that
Taoism followed the path of instituting a priestly order and hierarchy,
temples and monasteries and a sacred canon, attracting its own converts
to a new faith. Chinese recorded history only really began with the Shang
dynasty around 1600 BC. The discovery of a large number of ‘oracle
bones’ exposed us to much of the Shang dynasty's religious beliefs of
ancient times. Some 100,000 fragments of bone and shell are covered
with requests of all sorts, addressed to the spirits of their dead kings. So
now we know that the people of the pre-Confucian era, dating back many
thousands of years, believed in spirits who could intervene in their trials
and tribulations. But more importantly, the ‘deities of the hills and
streams, and other gods were worshipped’. Here we have a clear link to
the same ancient rituals of Sumer and Egypt, where kings were seen as
half-human, half-god, and therefore they were often worshipped
themselves as gods by the common people. Many of these rites passed on
to the modern forms of Chinese religion, maintaining an air of
mysticism, and possibly even divinity, around the Chinese royalty. Just as
in Sumer, early Chinese monarchs were often priests and kings
simultaneously, who would wage war. The Chou dynasty rulers believed
that they received a “mandate from heaven” to rule. The kings had to
perform sacrificial rituals to please the gods and report to the gods on
progress. They would also receive communication from the gods to
deliver to the people. The Chinese had a complete hierarchical structure
which went “Heaven to king; king to feudal lords; feudal lords to sub-
feudal lords; sub-feudal lords to the rest of the community”. The king had
full control of his lands but the ultimate control lay in the “will of
heaven”. Such was the feudal pyramid of the Chou dynasty, not far
removed from the structures set up by the Sumerian gods, attesting to the
ongoing violent character of the growing human race. A characteristic
which was very cunningly controlled by the Anunnaki gods. Prehistoric
Chinese records are very cloudy but it is evident from these ancientrituals that the gods of Sumer were just as active in China thousands of
years ago, as they were all over the world's emerging civilisations.
Teaching humans the art of cohabitation, agriculture, writing and through
the different characters of the ‘god in charge’, injected very specific
cultural diversity, like music, dance, poetry, architecture, and more.
Poetry, song and dance played a major part in religious rituals in China,
clearly inspired by the neighbouring Indian culture, which was
undoubtedly driven by the talented Inanna/Ishtar, goddess of love. Just
like in Sumer, the priests were also warriors, who would protect their
sacred shrines and temples. The great temple courts were used to
sacrifice war captives in front of the home crowd. In the following extract
from a temple liturgy we can compare the Chinese subservience to the
‘gods of heaven’ as they were worshipped in Sumer:
“Majestic never ending
is the Charge of Heaven
Your virtue descending
Oh illustrious King Wen
Overwhelms with blessing
Your servants on Earth….
May we always
Fear the wrath of heaven
So to keep his favour
And our ways even.”
Is it not fascinating that, as distant and diverse as the Chinese culture
may be to the Western culture, the image of a vengeful god who is feared
by his followers and who will unleash his ‘wrath’ upon man, seems to
follow every single group of early humans to the farthest corners of the
world, even today. Confucius stressed a number of fundamental values:
Li
- ritual, propriety, etiquette, etc.
Hsiao - love among family members
Yi
- righteousness
Xin - honesty and trustworthinessJen
- benevolence towards others; the highest Confucian virtue
Chung - loyalty to the state, etc.
Unlike most religions, Confucianism is primarily an ethical system with
rituals at important times during one's lifetime. The most important
periods recognised in the Confucian tradition are birth, reaching maturity,
marriage, and death.
Taoism. Origin circa 440 BC.
While the ‘activist’ philosophers in China were advocating their theories
in the courts of the cities, a whole new ‘Quietist’ philosophy was
developing in the countryside. Their concerns were ‘other-worldly’,
seeking self-awareness and self-cultivation through yogic practice. They
saw the unchanging 'oneness' underlying a world of change. They called it
‘Tao’. While all ancient Chinese philosophers spoke of their Tao, the
Quietists spoke of ‘Tao-ness’ itself. It was these Taoists who eventually
inspired the birth of Taoism, a mystical religion.
There are two collections of Taoist works that survive from the age of
the philosophers. They are Chuang Tzu and the Lieh Tzu. Towards the end
of this period another Taoist work appeared called the Tao Te Ching .
These three works are the earliest writings in a vast collection which
forms the Taoist canon. While there is some doubt about the true identity
of Lao Tzu, a contemporary of Confucius, he is seen as the patriarch and
the original founder of Taoism. In his writings the Tao Te Ching (The
Way and its Power), he describes the nature of life, the way to peace and
how a ruler should lead his life. Lao Tzu hoped it would help end the
constant feudal warfare and other conflicts of his time. Taoism became a
religion in 440 BC when it was adopted as a state religion. Tao can
roughly be translated as ‘path’, which is a force flowing through all life
and is the first cause of everything. The goal of Taoists is for everyone to
become ‘one’ with the Tao. Tai Chi, a technique of exercise using slow
deliberate movements, is used to balance the flow of energy or ‘chi’
within the body. One of the beliefs arising from the Chuang Tzu, is that a
man of ‘lesser knowledge’ or mundane thought, cannot conceptualise
‘greater knowledge’ or the vision of the mystic. This knowledge can onlybe attained in a state of trance, referred to as a state of “I lose me”.
People should develop virtue and seek compassion, moderation and
humility. One should plan any action in advance and achieve it through
minimal action. Yin (the dark side) and Yang (the light side) symbolise
pairs of opposites that are seen through the universe, such as good and
evil, light and dark, male and female. Does this remind you a bit of Star
Wars? The impact of human civilisation upsets the balance of Yin and
Yang. Taoists believe that people are by nature, good, and that one should
be kind to others simply because such treatment will most likely be
reciprocated.
Our link to the gods of Sumer comes in the Taoist description of what
should happen in a state of trance. The person should take off “on a
journey, riding upon the wind” borne by “cloud chariots”. There were
several people who were taken up into the realms of ‘heaven’ by the
Anunnaki. An experience of that nature would have changed their lives.
On their return they marvelled at the beauty, the sights from up high, the
feeling of flying through the sky ‘on clouds of heaven like an eagle’ and
other poetic descriptions of their adventure. When stories like this get
handed down orally over millennia, they would have had different effects
on different people. There must have been a contact between the
protagonists of Taoism and their Sumerian Earthling brethren, who had
had such cosmic experiences under the rule of the Anunnaki gods, a long
time ago. It is also interesting that the Taoists believe that the cycle of
life is made up of five recurring cycles that are represented by the five
elements. Earth, wood, metal, fire and water. Each element conquers its
predecessor in recurring cycles. There is a very strong parallel to the Inca
belief in their five Cycles of Life. Is it possible that the ancient gods may
have had something to do with this? China to Bolivia is a long way away,
so how did these philosophies cross paths between South America and
China thousands of years ago?
So the Age of Philosophers in China produced Confucianism and
Taoism. One maverick Taoist called Mo Tzu, who was also one of the
greatest philosophers of ancient China, was apparently promoting a
concept of ‘heaven’ and a personal ‘god’ to his followers. This was afascinating development in a culture which was obsessed with
meditation, Yin Yang and ‘chi’. But this cultural explosion to seek a
closer relationship with one's personal god infiltrated the new society.
Could this have had anything to do with the events described in the
Sumerian tablets? When Marduk, the god of Egypt, travelled the world,
telling humans that he was the ‘only and supreme god above all’,
terrorising humans into absolute obedience, and demanding their trust,
faith and fear in him? The Taoist Church even went as far as developing
rites and services for the atonement of sin. A little too close for comfort
when compared to what kind of relationships the Sumerian gods had with
their followers. Declaring your community's sins to the gods was
necessary to receive rewards and mercy from the gods. Taoists had to pay
five pecks of rice for redemption and all their sins were recorded in
writing and a copy was made available to ‘heaven’. What a perfect
system to keep tabs on your human slaves. This is breathtaking stuff. It
seems that this was the time when the more brutal gods of Sumer arrived
in the East to reap some of the rewards of Inanna's creative civilisation of
Humankind. They brought with them the more barbaric customs which
they had imposed on the humans of the Near East. The days of the
philosophers were gone, just as they were kept in their place in Greece by
brutal gods, the new gods of China and the Far East had arrived with a
vengeance.
It seems that the promises of immortality which Marduk made to the
Egyptian pharaohs had spread all over the world, even the Taoists became
obsessed with immortality. Obviously the ever-present gods of Sumer
were there to ensure that the humans were fully informed about their
passage into the afterlife, if they obeyed. Some Taoists even believed that
they could avoid death altogether, and simply pass into the ‘land of
immortals’ by following specific regimens and rules.
Jainism. Origin circa 420 BC.
Jainism has many similarities to Hinduism and Buddhism and it also
developed in the same part of the world. Jains believe in karma and
reincarnation, as do Hindus, but they believe that enlightenment andliberation from this cycle can only be achieved through asceticism. The
virtue of a great ascetic could protect a city from an enemy, so it was
fruitless to attack such a city until the ascetic had been corrupted or
destroyed. There is a story of an ascetic who generated such powers
through his penance, that it caused the gods to send down a ‘celestial
damsel’ of great beauty to seduce him and expend his accumulated
potency. There we go again! The gods of heaven who keep interfering
with Humankind. We know from the Sumerian tablets that the Anunnaki
females or ‘goddesses’ as they were seen by humans, were
‘breathtakingly beautiful’. Their offspring which they conceived with
mortal men, were equally beautiful. Here we have another perfect
example of where mythology crosses paths with popular religion, and yet
we hold onto what we call religion, and we discard the unexplainable as
‘myth’. How very convenient. Jainism follows similar beliefs as other
religions: that time is cyclical; that the universe undergoes growth,
decline, destruction, and re-creation perpetually. The Laws of Manu speak
about the Four Ages that follow each other, dating the ages back to the
last rebirth of Humankind some 12,000 years ago. What a coincidence! Is
that not what the Sumerian tablets say as well? When the Great Flood
destroyed the world and Noah (Ziusudra) survived in his ark to start
repopulating the world again? Another one of those coincidences that
historians simply push aside!
The Kalpa Sutra Of Bhadrabahu - Lives Of The Ginas - Life Of Mahavira
deals with the birth of their new prophet. We read some remarkable
things about the gods of the time and their influence on the people, and
even interaction between gods and the people. The desire for ascending to
heaven is very strong and just like Sumerians, these people worshipped
the gods in their ‘celestial abodes’. The gods must have convinced the
earthlings in this part of the world that they were sinful, just as the
Sumerian humans were informed:
“Obeisance to all Saints in the World!
This fivefold obeisance, destroying all sins, is of all benedictions the
principal benediction.
In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira… wherehe had lived for twenty Sagaropamas till the termination of his
allotted length of life, of his (divine nature, and of his existence
(among gods)…”
“O beloved of the gods, what, to be sure, will be the happy result
portended by these fourteen illustrious, great dreams?”
But they wanted real quality education and nurturing for the new prophet
to be born:
“And this boy, after having passed his childhood, and, with just
ripened intellect, having reached the state of youth … he will be
versed in the philosophy of the sixty categories, and well grounded
in arithmetic, in phonetics, ceremonial, grammar, metre, etymology,
and astronomy, and in many other brahmanical [and monastic]
sciences besides...O beloved of the gods; that matter is really such as
you have pronounced it….”
“In that period, in that age, Sakra, the chief and king of the gods, the
wielder of the thunderbolt, the destroyer of towns, the performer of a
hundred sacrifices, the thousand-eyed one, Maghavan, the punisher
of the Daitya Paka, the lord of the southern half of the Earth, the lord
of the thirty-two thousand celestial abodes… who wears spotless
clothes and robes… whose cheeks were stroked by fine, bright, and
trembling earrings of fresh gold [the most prosperous, the most
brilliant, the most mighty, the most glorious, the most powerful, and
the most happy one]…in the celestial abode… he who exercises and
maintains the supreme command, government, management,
guidance, direction, and sovereign power and generalship over the
thirty-two thousand gods of the celestial abodes, the eighty-four
thousand gods of a rank equal with that of himself, the thirty-two
chief gods, the four guardians of the world, the eight principal
queens with their trains, the three courts, the seven armies, and the
seven commanders of these armies…”
It strikes me that those were very specific kinds of utterances, with little
doubt in the mind of the writer, as to who was in charge and of what; andexactly how the power structures on Earth were organised. While these
writings are sacred to millions, some arrogant historians discard them
very quickly, and relegate the content to realms of mythology. How could
this be possible? It is either a living religion, passed down over thousands
of years, or all of the other religions should also be classified as myth.
The concept of ‘ahimsa’ or non-violence is a fundamental principle of
Jainism, because any act of violence against a living thing creates
negative karma which will adversely affect one's next life. It was also one
of the principles preached by Jesus, when he suddenly emerged in Canaan
at the age of 29. Many scholars have however denied that Jesus ever
preached the concept of rebirth and any references to it have been
removed from the New Testament. The founder of the Jain community
was Vardhamana, the last Jina in a series of 24 who lived in East India.
He attained enlightenment after 13 years of deprivation and committed
the act of ‘salekhana’, fasting to death, in 420 BC. You may remember
that Mahatma Gandhi started a fast of this kind to get the warring
Muslims and Hindus to stop fighting. Jains follow fruitarianism. This is
the practice of only eating that which will not kill the plant or animal
from which the food is taken.
Islam. Origin circa 622 AD.
Islam was founded around 622 AD by the Prophet Mohammed in the city
of Medina. Islam is an Arabic word which means ‘acceptance; surrender;
submission; or commitment’. I found these descriptions fascinating,
mainly because it echoes the words of the ‘god of Vengeance’ in the Old
Testament. We should not be surprised by this because the patriarch of
the Muslim faith is also Abraham. Although Islam is the youngest of the
world's great religions, Muslims do not view it as a new religion. They
believe that it is the same faith taught by the prophets Abraham, David,
Moses and even Jesus, but somehow the Jews and Christians got it wrong.
The exact date of Mohammed's birth is not known, but scholars generally
accept that he was born in Mecca circa 570 AD. Islam sees Mohammed
as the last prophet whose role it was to formalise and clarify the faith and
purify it by removing ideas that were added in error. He married a richwidow 15 years his senior and came under the influence of Jewish and
Christian teachings. He developed a reputation for honesty and wisdom.
Like all Arabs, Mohammed was a member of a tribe. The tribe he
belonged to was called the Quraysh and his tribal upbringing played an
important part in his role of uniting Islam behind a brand new
philosophy.
In pre-Islamic Arabia the Bedouins were not notably pious, but they
had certain religious practices. There were a number of spirits and
demons whom they propitiated (whose favour they had to win on a
constant basis). What is important to note is that they were highly
influenced by the ‘astral religion’ of the ancient Semitic people who led
them to recognise deities associated with heavenly bodies. Most of these
were goddesses with names like al-Lat; al-Uzzah; and al-Manat.
Mohammed's tribe was no exception, and they also worshipped a number
of different deities or gods. One of the gods which the Bedouins
worshipped was Allah, but he was by no means their main god and at that
point did not feature strongly and his function was rather vague. It
becomes evident that during Mohammed's structuring of Islam, he did
not introduce a new name or a new ‘god’, it was a god who was already
reasonably well established among the Arabs and Bedouins. What
astounds me is the way in which humans, and specifically historians, can
discriminate between these Arabic gods. While one of the ancient
mythological gods by the name of Allah was elevated to the ‘supreme’
god status, the others were summarily demoted and remained in the lesser
ranks of mythological deities. How is that possible? Do our historians
know something we don't? Or is it just their ignorance shining through
again?
The Quraysh was a powerful tribe which rose to take control of Mecca.
They built sacred shrines and erected their own deities in many places
throughout the city. But the Arabs also made pilgrimages to other shrines
erected around the peninsula. A popular spot was a shrine to god al-
Manat at Ukas, not far north of Mecca. But the most important centre of
pilgrimage was a rectangular stone building known as the Kaaba, in the
valley of Mecca. The principal god of the Kaaba was Hubal, but therewere other gods associated with the shrine as well. This pre-Islamic
pilgrimage to Kaaba, with its specific performance of rites, makes up
most of what is practised by Muslims today. They would visit their
shrines during certain months of the lunar calendar which were
considered sacred. During this time, all fighting was forbidden and
renunciation of hostilities allowed trade to flourish and festivities to take
place. Mohammed claimed that he was a Hanif, a group who believed that
they were of spiritual descent from Abraham and were highly inspired by
monotheism.
So those were just some of the events which led up to Mohammed's
encounter with the angel Gabriel and some of the thinking that went into
the philosophy of Islam. Before Mohammed received his calling, Arabian
paganism was showing great signs of decay. The Meccans were
worshipping not only Allah, but a host of other deities, whom they
referred to as “daughters of Allah”. This should not be surprising as the
rest of Humankind were doing the same in distant parts of the world.
Although Mohammed disagreed with the teachings of the Jews and
Christians he was impressed with the concept of ‘one god’ or
monotheism. He liked to retire to a certain cave on Mount Hira to
meditate and pray. Mohammed disclaimed that he could perform
miracles but he did claim to be the messenger of God himself. What is
most fascinating about how Islam received its holy scriptures in the form
of the Koran, are the circumstances surrounding the event. It is
commonly accepted among Muslims that Mohammed was illiterate,
which is one of the ‘miracles’ associated with the delivery of a complete
book by him. On one of those days in the cave or outside the cave under a
tree, the exact place is not certain, the angel Gabriel appeared to
Mohammed and instructed him to “Recite”. The following lines are
fascinating because they are almost identical to what some of the ancient
Sumerian clay tablets tell us about the creation of the ‘Adamu’.
“Recite in the name of your Lord who created, created man from clots of
blood… Who by pen taught man what he did not know.”
The book of Genesis tells a very similar story about the creation of
Adam, but the most graphic description we have of this first creation ofman comes from the clay tablets that predate the Bible and the Koran by
as much as 4,000 years. It describes how the Anunnaki gods “created the
Adamu from the African clay… and Adamu's skin was the same colour as
the dark hue of the clay.” But what is extremely disturbing is the way in
which the ‘angel’ approached Mohammed. It is recorded that after the
first time the angel commanded him to “recite in the name of God”,
Mohammed did not respond, probably out of fear or confusion? You can
be the judge of that. The angel grabbed him by the throat and shook him
violently while repeating the command again. After the second command,
Mohammed still did not respond, so the angel proceeded to choke him
until Mohammed was compelled to do what he was told. It now makes
complete sense why Mohammed was ‘so disturbed by his experience’ and
why at first he was filled with doubt, even wondering if he had lost his
sanity or whether he may have been possessed by a malignant spirit. The
outcome of this experience and an extended period of ‘Koranic’
revelations to Mohammed, was the complete works known to Muslims as
the “unquestionable words of God himself” – the Koran. I was always
told a different story, one where Mohammed went into the cave for 40
days and during that time he wrote down the words as dictated to him by
the ‘angel’. That seems to be the popularised ‘fairytale’ version, not what
probably happened. The knowledge that was bestowed on Mohammed in
the cave, came to him in the form of revelations over an extended period,
it did not all happen at once. It is said that the words of the angel “were
inscribed upon his heart” and he could suddenly remember them and
recite them in moments of inspiration. During Mohammed's life these
verses would come to him from time to time and be inscribed upon palm
leaves, stones or any material that came to hand. In his English
translation of the Koran, N.J. Dawood describes it as “the earliest and by
far the finest work of classical Arabic prose”. The final collection of
Mohammed's revelations in the Koran was completed during the
caliphate of Umar the second Caliph, but the authorised version was only
established during the caliphate of Uthman, his successor between 644
and 656 AD.
The two sacred texts of Islam are the Koran, which are the words ofAllah, “the One True God”, as given to Mohammed; and the Hadith,
which is a collection of Mohammed's sayings. Although the Muslims
accepted Jesus as a prophet, they accused the Christians of blasphemy for
worshipping him as the son of God, when they were strictly commanded
to “worship none but Him”. But Mohammed did not have it easy at the
beginning of his preaching career. At first the Meccans ignored him; but
as his following grew they feared him. Eventually they began to oppose
him and Mohammed became somewhat of a hated individual in Mecca.
The levels of intolerance grew so high that in 622 AD Mohammed and his
followers were forced to leave Mecca. Fortunately, he managed to
negotiate a favourable deal with the leaders of a city called Yathrib, in
order to be accepted and given protection. Soon after this, Yathrib
became known as Medina, the city of the prophet. Since this was a
decisive turning point in the life and fortunes of Mohammed and his
followers, it was adopted as the starting point of the Islamic calendar and
his emigration from Mecca is known as the ‘Hegira’.
From this point Mohammed proclaimed the one unique God who
created the universe, established its order, controlling its fate by his hand.
Allah demands sole sovereignty and submission to his ordinance. There
was a lot of emphasis placed on the horrors awaiting the disobedient ones
who were ungrateful to their lord and refused submission. The Koran
speaks vividly of the torments of hell and paints a gruesome picture of
what will happen to those who do not obey the explicit word of Allah.
Does this sound familiar? I, for one, do not see any real difference
between what the god of the Old Testament was saying to humans, and
what the words of Allah are saying in the Koran. I mentioned before that I
find the Old Testament to be a very scary book. But, only when I read the
Koran, did I realise that there is a scarier book. Let me not beat about the
bush here, for those who have not read the Koran, I urge you to do so, and
then ask yourself if you were not scared out of your wits. It surpasses the
Bible by a long way. The ‘God of vengeance and retribution’ rises to
greater heights in the Koran. It is truly remarkable how similar the
rewards, which are promised to the righteous, are to the biblical rewards
of heaven and paradise. In the book of The Winds of the Koran it statesthat “when the day of judgement comes… The righteous will dwell
amidst gardens and fountains, for they have done good work.” The day of
reckoning in the Bible is perfectly echoed in the book of The
Resurrection of the Koran, which tells us that on the day of resurrection,
“There shall be no refuge. For to your Lord, on that day, all shall return.
Man shall on that day be told of all his deeds, from first to last. Indeed,
man shall bear witness against himself, plead as he may with his
excuses… On that day there shall be joyous faces looking towards their
Lord. On that day there shall be mournful faces, dreading some great
affliction.”
It is clear that the god of the Bible and the god of the Koran must have
been related. And so they are, for if Abraham is the patriarch of Islam, as
he is of Christians and Jews, their god must surely be one and the same!
They certainly seem to preach the same death and destruction to
Humankind every step of the way. Every statement and every innuendo is
filled with the kind of premeditated control factor that only humans are
capable of. The constant threats against Humankind smell of an anxious
individual who is desperately trying to impose his authority on the lesser
species which he created for his own device. The way in which Abraham
interacted with his god in the Bible, is echoed strongly some 2,600 years
later in the relationship between Humankind and the ‘god’ of the Koran.
While Jesus had turned the ‘god of vengeance’ of the Old Testament into
the ‘god of love and forgiveness’, the poor Muslims were dragged all the
way back to the mentality of Abraham and their new ‘god’ became even
more schizophrenic. The ‘god of mercy; the gracious one; the
compassionate’ but also the ‘god of punishment’. Suddenly the issues of
equality among all humans, which the prophet Jesus had preached, were
overridden by the new ‘word of god’ which told us that women are not
quite as equal as men. There are very clear directions on how to deal with
a wife who commits some arbitrary oversight, and that a woman's
testimony is not quite as valuable as a man's. In the book of The Cow
2.98, it reminds us that “God is the enemy of the unbelievers.” I find it
immensely unpleasant and horrifying to constantly get bombarded by
‘threat after threat’on every page of the Koran of how ‘god’ will punishthe non-believers, and yet in the same paragraph we are told that “if you
fear God, he will grant you salvation and cleanse you of your sins and
forgive you.”
It seems as if nothing had changed and the manipulative Anunnaki
gods were still trying to hold onto what they had established on Earth.
But their grip was slowly slipping as people became enlightened and
more evolved and more educated. Humankind was suddenly looking into
the greater spiritual realms, realising that the vengeful gods of the past
who demanded to be worshipped, who claimed to have absolute power,
may have been the ‘god’ of the primitive man, but not the true God of the
universe. The only way in which the remaining gods could impose their
authority on Humankind, was the only way they knew from their past
activities – brutal force, violence, the promise of reward for those who
followed orders and punishment to those who disobeyed.
The inexplicable behaviour of ‘angels’ in the Bible, when they destroy
cities, punish sinners, smite the unrighteous and more, seems to continue
in the way that the ‘angel Gabriel’ attacked Mohammed and basically
forced him into submission. Let's face it, the angels in those days were
very scary characters, appearing to be physical and humanlike. Where
have they all gone? They are almost always described as having some
kind of fearsome weapon with which they could do any kind of damage or
control any kind of unruly situation among the humans, like the one in
Sodom. The Koran speaks of humans as ‘mortals’ as if there was another
group of immortal humanoids on Earth. “When the sight of mortals is
confounded and the moon eclipsed…”
No matter how hard we try to turn a blind eye to the ongoing activities
by the Sumerian gods, they creep into every crevice of our global
religions. We simply cannot escape them. But the worst part of their
interaction with humans and the control they have been exercising for so
many thousand years, has totally corrupted our ability to distinguish
between ‘god’ and ‘God’. In the past 2,000 years the remaining Anunnaki
gods on Earth have had to resort to extremes in a final attempt to control
humans with fear. They certainly did a great job, as one by one, the
religions fell prey to the brutal victimisation of Humankind by theSumerian gods. In the book of YA SIN in the Koran, we read a very
similar description to what the Sumerian tablets tell us, about how the
‘Adamu’ was created by molecular splicing of the DNA and artificial
insemination. The Koran says, “Is man not aware that We created him
from a little germ?” But the story goes into greater detail in the book of
The Believers when ‘god’ says almost verbatim what the Sumerian tablets
tell us. “We first created man from an essence of clay; then placed him, a
living germ, in a secure enclosure. The germ we made a clot of blood, and
the clot a lump of flesh. This we fashioned into bones, then clothed the
bones with flesh…” Those words are absolutely astounding, when
compared to the biblical account of the birth of Adam, but even more
inexplicable when compared to the Sumerian tablets, which were written
some 3,000 years before Mohammed. But it is the last part of this
Koranic phrase which sends a sense of utter disbelief through one's body.
As the Sumerian tablets talk about the creation of another species or a
new creature which they referred to as the ‘primitive worker’, so the
Koran says: “… thus bringing forth another creation.”
I trust that all Imams and preachers will argue the use of the term
“We” as the way in which God would refer to himself. I find it a little
strange that this term is not consistent and is rather prevalent in the part
where the ‘creation of man’ is outlined. The Sumerian tablets clearly
describe that the creation was performed by three Anunnaki gods, and
therefore the collective “We” is used. If the angel Gabriel was a
messenger for Marduk, the son of Enki who proclaimed himself as ‘god
above all others’ he would have most certainly delivered the message in
those terms to Mohammed. No matter how we look at the global
religions, the ancient Sumerian gods are ever-present, doing the same
kind of recognisable things, which become very familiar the more we
read the ancient clay tablets and compare them to all the so-called
‘sacred’ books of the latter religions.
Sikhism. Origin circa 1500 AD.
Sikhism is the ninth largest religion in the world today with over 23
million followers. This relatively new faith was founded by Shri GuruNanak Dev Ji in the Punjab area, which today crosses from India to
Pakistan. He was born in 1469, probably in the village of Talvandi, which
is about 40 miles south-west of Lahore. At some stage during the year
1500 he began the life of a wandering ascetic, travelling all over India
and possibly even beyond to distant places for many years. His travels are
well documented in a collection of writings called the Janam-sakhis. The
teachings of Guru Nanak can loosely be described as a blend of Hindu
tradition and Muslim belief, but this kind of representation could easily
be misinterpreted so we need to be careful not to simplify it in such a
way. He was fortunate enough to be granted a piece of land on the banks
of the river Ravi and there he established the village of Kartarpur. The
Guru Nanak spent most of his life in this village until he died in 1539
AD, a date which most scholars seem to agree on.
The Guru received a vision after which he began preaching the ‘way to
enlightenment and God through inward meditation’. Sikhs believe in a
single formless God which they refer to by many names, one of which is
‘nirankar’, “the Formless One”, who can be known through meditation
which also includes tantric yoga. Sikhs pray many times each day and are
prohibited from worshipping idols. Guru Nanak tackled the age-old
question of ‘how can one know God’ which he answered this way: “One
cannot know God, for God in his fullness is far beyond the understanding
of mortal beings.” But he also described God as “sarab viapak” meaning
‘everywhere present’ and ‘visible to the eye of the spiritually awakened
person’. This becomes a pivotal point in our unravelling of world
religions, because the Guru claimed that such ‘spiritually awakened’
people could communicate with God, but only if they applied the specific
principles rigorously. He taught that the chief obstacle that impeded
salvation was the human condition. He further said that people are
imprisoned by the endless cycles of life and death because of their
attachment to worldly things. Such people are known as victims of
‘maya’. Guru Nanak explained that people must comprehend the divine
order of the universe in both physical and spiritual terms, and they should
strive to bring themselves into harmony with it. The Sikh discipline
breaks away from the common practices of most religions like templerites; mosque worshipping; pilgrimages and so on. “The only acceptable
house of worship is the human heart.” If you apply the principles of ‘nam
siram’ as taught by the Guru, you will experience ‘growing towards God’
and ‘growing into God.’ They believe in karma and samsara
(reincarnation of the soul or being reborn as a new organism) as Hindus
do, but Sikhs reject the caste system. They believe that everyone has
equal status in the eyes of god.
The Sikhs have two collections of sacred scriptures. The first one,
called Adi Granth, seems to carry more weight and is the undisputed
canonical work. While the second and later compilation, called the
Dasam Granth, carries its own distinctive importance. After the death of
Guru Nanak, a series of nine Gurus who are regarded as reincarnations of
Guru Nanak, led the Sikh movement until 1708, each writing a
contribution toward the sacred scriptures. The final text, the Shri Guru
Granth Sahib, was compiled by the tenth Guru, Gobind Singh. It consists
of the hymns and writings of the first ten Gurus, along with texts from
different Muslim and Hindu saints. The holy text is considered the 11th
and final Guru’s work. In 1931 Sikh scholars started to prepare the Reht
Maryada which is the Sikh code of conduct and conventions which
contains 27 articles:
Article 1 defines who is a Sikh:
“Any human being who faithfully believes in:
One Immortal Being,
Ten Gurus, from Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind Singh,
The Guru Granth Sahib,
The utterances and teachings of the ten Gurus and the baptism
bequeathed by the tenth Guru, and who does not owe allegiance to
any other religion, is a Sikh.”
The following extracts are taken from the translation of the Sri Guru
Granth Sahib by Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa. The words once again display our
confused obsession with a schizophrenic god, with many influences from
the Koran and some other evident feeders from Hinduism. But in the end,
where does this chanting and meditating get us? I get a distinct feelingthat it is a continuation of the fear of the ‘god of vengeance’ as he was
known in biblical times and before. The same god who made the
Egyptians so fearful and obedient. Although this religion is well-wrapped
up in non-violence, their god certainly reserves the right to dish out
punishment whenever he deems fit. The verses seem to be wrapped in a
coat of self preservation in the face of possible punishment, so let's chant
the phrases just in case we need to appear to be pious:
“The Lord Master, the Lord of the Universe, is infinite and
unapproachable; God is the all-pervading Lord of all. The angels, the
Siddhas, the beings of spiritual perfection, the heavenly heralds and
celestial singers meditate on You. The Yakhsha demons, the guards
of the divine treasures, and the Kinnars, the dancers of the god of
wealth chant Your Glorious Praises. Millions of Indras and countless
gods and super-human beings meditate on the Lord Master and
celebrate His Praises. The Merciful Lord is the Master of the
masterless, O Nanak; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, one is saved.”
“Millions of gods and goddesses of wealth serve Him in so many
ways. The invisible and visible beings worship Him in adoration…
All the sources of creation, and all languages meditate on Him,
forever and ever… He is the Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His
Saints; As much as God has revealed to us, that much we can speak
with our tongues…We are all beggars, He is the One and only Giver;
He is not far away, but is with us, ever-present. Chant the Naam, the
Name of the Lord of the Universe; don't be lazy… you shall not have
to go to the City of Death. Pain, trouble and fear will not afflict you;
meditating on the Naam, a lasting peace is found. With each and
every breath, worship the Lord in adoration; meditate on the Lord
God in your mind and with your mouth. O kind and compassionate
Lord, O treasure of sublime essence, treasure of excellence, please
link me to Your service…The Purifier of sinners is the Naam, the
Pure Name of the Immaculate Lord. The darkness of doubt is
removed by the healing ointment of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. Bythe healing ointment of the Guru's spiritual wisdom, one meets the
Immaculate Lord God, who is totally pervading the water, the land
and the sky. If He dwells within the heart, for even an instant,
sorrows are forgotten. The wisdom of the all-powerful Lord and
Master is incomprehensible; He is the Destroyer of the fears of all…
The Lord Master saves even the sinners. So many are saved; they
cross over the terrifying world-ocean, contemplating the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. In the beginning and in the end, countless are
those who seek the Lord… and grasp the protection of the Lord of
the Universe, the merciful… The Lord is the Lover of His devotees;
this is His natural way. Wherever the Saints worship the Lord in
adoration, there He is revealed. God blends Himself with His
devotees in His natural way, and resolves their affairs.”
Bahá'í . Origin circa 1863 AD.
The Baha'i Faith arose from Islam in the 1800s based on the
teachings of Baha'u'llah and has become a distinct worldwide faith
with over six million followers. It did not take too much reading of
the Baha'i scriptures to realise that the oppressive human obsession
to please its violent and vengeful god is as evident here as it is in
most other religions of the world. Here is a short example of what I
mean. Please see the underlying subservient fear which highlights
the ‘master-slave’ relationship established by the Anunnaki gods of
ancient times. This is an extract from the Epistle of the Son of the
Wolf clearly highlighting the sinfulness of Humankind, very quickly
reminding them that if they ‘fear and obey’ they will be spared some
horrific retribution:
“Alas, alas, for my waywardness, and my shame, and my sinfulness,
and my wrong-doing that have withheld me from the depths of the
ocean of Thy unity and from fathoming the sea of Thy mercy.
Wherefore, alas, alas! and again alas, alas! for my wretchedness and
the grievousness of my transgressions! Thou didst call me into
being, O my God, to exalt Thy Word, and to manifest Thy Cause.”
Baha'i followers believe that God has sent nine great prophets tomankind through whom the Holy Spirit has revealed the ‘Word of
God’. They gave rise to all the major world religions. But the
differences in the teachings of each prophet are due to the needs of
the society at the time, and they were adapted to the level of
revelation mankind was ready to digest at the time. This is
fascinating, especially if you look at the apparent reversal of
‘digestible’ revelations which followed Christianity. It seems to
have gone downhill from there, through the conflicts between the
Muslims and Christians, to the destruction of the knowledge in the
Dark Ages. Baha'i followers promote gender and race equality,
freedom of expression and assembly, world peace and a world
government. They believe that a single world government led by
Baha'i's will be established at some point in the future. The faith
does not attempt to preserve the past but does embrace the findings
of science. Baha'i's believe that every person has an immortal soul
which cannot die, but is freed to travel through the spirit world after
death. This philosophy seems to clash with the fearful relationship
with god which some of their writings portray. I must add that this
religion looks very interesting as it seems to push the boundaries of
progressive thought, including new-found knowledge in science and
astronomy, and yet at the same time there are weird undertones
which desperately hold onto some of the old dogmas from other
religions. The Baha'i seem to pride themselves as being the new
progressive faith for all, ready to take humanity into the new era.
The following extract from the introduction to their most sacred
b o o k , Kitab-i-Aqdas, creates a conflict between old and new
philosophies mainly because it desperately wants to move away
from the ‘old’ and embrace the ‘new age’. Yet it advocates that its
entire doctrine is squarely based on the foundations of the ‘old
dogmatic’ religions. How does one reconcile the two? I cannot help
but wonder if the legacy of the manipulative, conniving Anunnaki is
not really behind this very cleverly disguised and attractive religious
movement. This is a slice from the Sacred Texts website :“Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred
Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Kitab-i-Aqdas is of unique importance.
‘To build anew the whole world’ is the claim and challenge of His
Message, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future world
civilisation that Baha'u'llah has come to raise up. Its provisions rest
squarely on the foundation established by past religions, for, in the
words of Baha'u'llah, ‘This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in
the past, eternal in the future.’ In this Revelation the concepts of the
past are brought to a new level of understanding, and the social laws,
changed to suit the age now dawning, are designed to carry humanity
forward into a world civilisation the splendours of which can as yet
be scarcely imagined. In its affirmation of the validity of the great
religions of the past, the Kitab-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths
enunciated by all the Divine Messengers: the unity of God, love of
one's neighbour, and the moral purpose of Earthly life. At the same
time it removes those elements of past religious codes that now
constitute obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and the
reconstruction of human society.”
This chapter on religion was extremely difficult to compile and it took
a great deal of energy not to produce a glossary of religions that reduces
them to a few pages of pulp fiction. But in the end, I have to be brutally
honest and say that I believe they do not deserve to be much more than
pulp fiction. The amount of history and culture surrounding each and
everyone of the religions is astounding. After all, they are the
cornerstones of their own communities. Is that not ironic? The active
ingredient for conflict and war is the cornerstone of every society! Pretty
messed up is it not? As hard as I tried to extract the necessary essence to
stimulate the reader's mind and show a clear thread of confusion that
binds them all together, there is much more that could be said and
explored. But it is very apparent that they all share a few common
underlying symptoms. The relentless search for something, which is
reminiscent of the ancient mariners who went in search of the edge of the
world; the constant referral to fantastical beings with amazing powers;
each one believing that they have the answer; not one of them looking atour past with clarity of mind to see where we may be heading. Those
religions that do engage the human past, only do so with ulterior motives,
which are mostly to disprove the others while entrenching themselves as
‘the only one’. The result of all this manic activity has dumped me
squarely in a giant void of uncertainty greater than when I started
investigating our fabulous religions. We are constantly faced by a god
who is brutal and selfish, imposes all kinds of hardships on humans;
changes his name and then does the same thing elsewhere. Or he enslaves
humans on this planet in never-ending cycles of karmic madness, in the
weird hope that the ignorant humans will learn from their mistakes. How
could they possibly learn from their mistakes if they keep returning to the
same place, more stupid than before?
The true face of God has not been revealed; our origins have not been
explained; we still don't know who we are, where we come from and why
we are here. I am talking about the real facts and not the fairytale and
horror stories which have kept us humans enslaved for too long. You be
the judge. Does the outline of our so-called holy religions give you a
feeling of confidence, and that we have it all under control? I am afraid it
does the opposite. It graphically exposes the insecurity of Humankind and
our constant struggle to find out the real truth about ourselves. But it is so
tightly wrapped up in syrups of different flavours, that it has most
probably caused a global diabetes syndrome and we must be losing our
sight and other senses. Surely the answers to our problems are not to be
found in the dogma of these man-made religions?
