## About Project Camelot

A lot of GREAT information and links here.

https://projectavalon.net/lang/en/about_project_camelot.html

I will write more in due course about the chain of events - not yet reported in one place - which led to the separation of the two sites and the decision to archive Camelot as a library.

Of course, Camelot was taken down. That decision was made certainly by the end of summer 2009 - after our video conversations with Pete Peterson and Steven Greer, our stand on the vaccinations issue, and Henry Deacon's three public appearances culminating in his statement on stage at the Barcelona Exopolitics Congress that he had visited the Mars base.

Not only that, but we significantly angered the Church of Scientology with our Dane Tops interview exposé. And back in 2008, we had irritated the Illuminati after our interview with Leo Zagami and our contact with the Norwegian Politician (Khaqan Khan).

Then in October 2008 we met Jake Simpson. The evening I spent with him in which we encountered the highly-classified Anunnaki-sourced AI surveillance system is documented on our Jake Simpson report. We were both affected, but brushed it off. Nevertheless, we may then have attracted the attention of some powerful off-planet adversaries.

The effect of all this was the accumulation of anything between three and seven powerful groups of enemies - and Camelot's fate was probably sealed. There's quite a bit more to say about all of this, but the above may at least start to answer some questions that many have understandably been asking.

Our work, of course, continues - and the opportunity is that the two sites which now replace one, in addition to the archived library, will do even more to spread important information that people need to hear and understand, while permitting both Kerry and myself to focus on aspects of our mission that strongly resonate with each of us.

## Barcelona Exopolitics Congress, Mars?

What a transcript! https://projectcamelot.org/lang/en/bob_dean_transcript_barcelona_2009_en.html

Bob Dean (BD):  I hope I can be heard. Will someone turn this on?

Before I begin, I would like to say a couple of words of deep appreciation for the sponsors and people who have put this program together. I have been involved in speaking publicly all over the planet and all over the United States. I have been to conferences here, I have been to conferences there, and I know how terribly difficult it can be to put a program like this together.

I have to say I have tremendous respect and admiration for the people who have done this. Most of all, I respect their courage for dealing with a subject like this where most of the elite leadership and the power groups of the world want this subject to go away. And these courageous young men who have put this together are brave and they deserve your respect and your admiration, and I want to say I thank you because I know what you’ve been through.

[applause]

Now, I must explain something else to you. I never read from a script. I don’t have a prepared script to follow. I get up on a stage and I talk to people like yourselves and I kind of wing it.

I have so much material and I have such a problem of keeping it under the allotted time that I’ve been given. I have come today prepared to speak to you for three hours. I am only allowed one hour and fifteen minutes. So something is going to have to give. But bear with me, I’ll do the damndest job I can. It’s important that you see the photographs of the NASA pictures that I have brought with me.

Now, my journey began 45 years ago. I began a journey that, if I had known then what I know now, if I had known the pain, the anguish, the heartbreak that I was going to experience over these 45 years, I might not have started that journey at all.

But here I am in Barcelona in 2009 with some of the most delightful people I have ever met. And looking back, I find that the journey was worth the effort; it was worth the pain; it was worth the heartbreak. I’m delighted to be here and I’m delighted to see all of you out there.

This is such an encouragement to me that people are beginning to demand the truth. They know they have been lied to from the very beginning, and they want to know. And I’m going to -- here, this afternoon, hopefully -- contribute one small measure to helping you understand and helping you know.

Most of my adult life, or most of the first part of my adult life, I was a professional soldier. I was in the army. I joined the army in 1950 to avoid the draft, ended up going to Officer’s Candidate School (OCS); and, so help me God, while I was going to OCS at Fort Riley, Kansas, the North Koreans invaded South Korea.

The next thing I know I’m on the front lines in Korea being shot at by a bunch of pissed-off Chinese and North Koreans who tried to kill me -- and I had nothing against them; I didn’t want to kill them. Here I am, in 1951, leading combat troops in Korea in one of the bloodiest wars we have ever had, and the rest, I guess you could say, is history.

I led combat troops in Korea in 1951; I spent 27 years on active duty and I also was involved in the war of Southeast Asia in 1970, where I was part of an organization that gathered intelligence in the jungles of Southeast Asia: South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Let me tell, you some of those years were rather harrowing.

The most harrowing experience I was to have was when I was assigned to Paris, France, in 1963, to what we considered in those days a plush assignment, a plumb assignment. I was able to go to Paris, France, take my family with me and my children went to high school in Paris and, as I said, this was a plumb assignment. I had no idea what I was to find when I got there.

When I arrived in the summer of 1963, I arrived with a Top Secret clearance. When I arrived at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe, which was located at that time in a small town known as Rocquencourt, right outside of Paris, my security clearance was upgraded to Cosmic Top Secret, which was then -- and still is today -- the highest level of security classification that NATO has.

I had to have a Cosmic Top Secret clearance to work in SHOC, Supreme Headquarters Operations Center: the war room. I was a Senior Master Sergeant at the time and, when I was assigned in SHOC, I was given the job of maintaining the Duty Roster. We worked on a 24-hour basis, day after day after day. And I was given the job of running the Duty Roster when I worked in SHOC.

Back in those days -- let me tell you, the war rooms were somewhat primitive. You’ve seen pictures today; I’m sure, of the control centers of the most major installations like S.A.C. [Strategic Air Command] in Colorado Springs. Everything is electronic. Everything is demonstrated on the wall extensions just like this mural that’s up here.

Back in those days we had teletype; we had field telephones and, if we wanted something on display, we had to go up and take a pin and put it on a wall and show the controllers where this division was, where that Soviet regiment was and so on and so on; very primitive.

When I arrived in the summer in 1963, I heard rumors about a study that was underway. Now, it interested me instantly, because the study was about UFOs and I was intrigued by that possibility. I was curious about UFOs and had no idea then what they represented. But we used to discuss this in SHOC, in the war room, that something was underway. What was it about? What happened?

Well, it appears that on the morning of the 2nd of February 1961, World War III almost began. It was involved in the flyover of large numbers of circular metallic craft, flying in formation, very obviously under intelligent control. They would fly out of the Soviet sector in the Warsaw Pact toward the U.S. in formation at a high rate of speed and at a very high altitude. They would turn north over the English Channel over the southern coast of England and then they would disappear off of NATO radar over the Norwegian Sea.

On that morning of the 2nd February 1961, World War III almost began. The Soviets went on red alert. The NATO forces went on red alert. Everybody was, you know … fingers on their triggers, thumbs poised above those red buttons. And World War III was just moments away.

Within 20 minutes, it was all over. The objects flew, turned north and disappeared off of radar. It was all over. After this event occurred, a British Air Marshal, by the name of Sir Thomas Pike, who was a Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe at that time; he was the deputy to my boss, General Lyman Lemnitzer, an American Four-Star General who was known as SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander of Europe.

Air Marshal Pike says: I’ve had enough of this. These objects had been showing up regularly, from time to time. As I said, they almost triggered a war.Air Marshal Pike said: We are going to come to terms and find out what the hell is going on here. I want to know.

So he began a study. He initiated a study in SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] headquarters that was to last for three years. They published it and issued it in the summer of 1964 while I was there working in the war room. They titled it An Assessment: An Evaluation of a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe.

That’s all it had. Just a title head and front, couldn’t learn very much about that: An Assessment: An Evaluation of a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe.

I was working in the war room one early morning around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and, as I jokingly used to refer to it, the coffee was too black to drink. We read all the newspapers and magazines. Many of you have heard military life is about 99 percent boredom broken up with one percent of sheer terror. And that’s the way it used to be and that’s the way it probably is even today.

I’m sitting there nodding off, and this American Air Force Full Colonel looked at me and he says: Wake up.

He went over to the vault. The vault at SHOC was a walk-in safe. You opened the door and walked in and we kept classified documents in there. The colonel went over to the vault, the file, and pulled out this document and threw it on my desk and he says: Read that; that’ll wake you up.

Ladies and gentlemen, my life changed. I opened the first page and I couldn’t put it down. I read and read and read. And I read it every time I was on duty in the war room. I was shocked; I was stunned by the implications of what I read in that study. As I said, my life has never been ever quite the same.

The study, briefly -- and I have to briefly lay this out; I could talk for two hours about this -- but the study simply concluded this: Is there a threat to Allied Forces in Europe? Apparently not.

They concluded that the planet Earth and the human race had been under some kind of survey or observation going on for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. They concluded, in 1964, that there were at least four different groups coming here, observing us, surveying us, analyzing us, closely watching us, what we were up to, what we were doing. They concluded that it did not appear to be a military threat involved, because their repeated demonstrations of incredibly advanced technology demonstrated to us that, if they had been hostile or malevolent, there was absolutely nothing we could do. If they were evil in their intent and they were hostile toward us, it would have been over a long time ago.

So, the conclusion was there were four different groups involved. They have been coming here for a very, very long time. Apparently they were not malevolent or hostile. The question was: What the hell are they doing here? Why are they here and why are they interested in us? Well, we did not know in 1964 what their agenda or their motives were and I will tell you, honestly and frankly, that even today our authorities, our senior military, our national security people still don’t totally grasp what their motives are, what their agendas are.

Well, this study in 1964 was simply a beginning for me. As I said, I was never really quite the same again. I jokingly say I’m usually a normal human being. And, after I read that study and launched on my 45 years of research, I lost all aspects of normality. I will be frank and tell you that over the years of my study, and the material that I have learned and gathered has brought about in me a complete destruction of my old world view, my old world paradigms.

The world view that I held since I was a kid growing up -- everything made sense, you know. I knew why I was here and I knew where I was going, what was taking place. After I spent 45 years on this, it all collapsed around my knees. That was the destructive aspect of my personality. That was the part that changed me completely from the kind of human being that I had been before into the kind of human being I am today.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am totally alienated. [laughter] No pun intended.

I said in a couple of interviews and previews and such: I have had -- for many, many years -- a love-hate relationship with the human race. One moment I love you. The next minute I hate your guts. One minute I adore you for the potential and the beauty of your music and your literature and your art and the next minute I’m saying: To hell with all of you. Blow them up. Let them blow themselves up. Clean the planet off. Get rid of them.

That’s part of the struggle of having lost your old worldview when your whole paradigm collapses around your knees. So the man standing in front of you here today is literally a human wreck, as compared to what I used to be. But I feel pretty good about it. I lost all my old illusions. I opened my eyes and I saw the future. And I’m very happy about what I see.

I have learned over the years from an infinite variety of sources here, there and everywhere. I didn’t retire from the army until 1976 and I kept my Top Secret clearance up until that moment. After I retired, I went to work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and worked another 14 years for the U.S. government, where I had a Top Secret clearance.

So I have a total of 41 years of federal service to the United States. But I’ve heard things over the years that literally still today stun me and shock me. I’ve learned that the human race is a hybrid race. I’ve learned that we are not merely alone; we have never been alone. We have had an intimate interrelationship with advanced extraterrestrial intelligence from the beginning of our history. And let me tell you that that intimate interrelationship is still going on.

This one race, in particular, apparently reengineered us as a species about 200,000 years ago. What we are here today is what we call homo sapien sapiens -- you’re an engineered creature. Your genetics have been manipulated. You’re not the same as what you were and you are not the same as to what your children and grandchildren and great grandchildren will be in the next hundred years.

The human race is going through a transition. It’s more than a transition. It’s what I have learned to be a transcendent transformation into a new race, into a new future. And your descendants will be as different from what you are here today as what you are from the old Australopithecus happened to be many years ago.

That’s not something to be afraid of. It’s something to look forward to. You’re growing, you’re developing and you’re becoming a new race, a new species. Your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren and the descendents on in the next century or two have destiny in the stars. Don’t you doubt that for a minute.

This species, this race, this troublesome bunch of monkeys, has a destiny in the stars and we are a part of this infinite universe filled with intelligent life. And we have been from the beginning but we are only now beginning to wake up and see it. Only now are we beginning to open our eyes and listen with our ears and look out there and say, all right where have I been? What am I now? Where am I going?

As I said, your destiny is in the stars. Your generations to come, your descendants, your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren will go out there and they will claim their rightful place. [applause] In a universe filled with intelligent life. Your place out there belongs to you. You have a right to that and you will claim it.

There is so much to talk about. I’ve got some slides that I have to share with you. Would you gentlemen please put the first picture up on the screen? I’m being assisted by some very wonderful people back behind the scenes.

I like to start with a shot like this. Pictures of this nature inspire me. It gives you a glimpse of the community you are a part of, a little glimpse of the stars out there, the nebulae. That’s where you’re from and that’s where you’re going home again to. That’s where you belong. Next picture, please.

I love these; they’re so beautiful. I have some of these on my wall at home. They inspire me. I look at them and I have the sense of recognition that I’ve been there before and I know that I’m going back.

But something happened in my country over the last few years that I am very, very troubled by. Just last week the United States celebrated the 40th anniversary of putting a man on the moon. They went through this whole whoop-dee-do of patting ourselves on the back. Gee, wasn’t that neat. Armstrong, Aldrin, you know, Collins up there in orbit, on the moon. Aren’t we great people, aren’t we magnificent? Look what we did.

Well let me tell you about a couple of things they did that you may not have ever have heard about before. They took the few pictures they had; they had it all televised. Everybody -- Rock, Walter Cronkite and all of them were looking up. Golly, gee, isn’t this great, isn’t this neat? We’ve got a couple of guys on the moon.

Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program -- the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking of guys here and there. They erased, for Christ’s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events.

Now we’re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were disruptive, socially unacceptable, politically unacceptable. I’ve become furious. I’m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience.

The idea, when I found out, that they had erased 40 rolls of film involving of several thousand individual shots about what really happened up there, I became so furious that, you know, I could have punched the director of NASA in the nose.

I’m not the easiest man. I like to tell people that, like Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady, I have the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein, so I really am a gentle man. But I have the capability, the potential of being rather dangerous and violent. And these lies and these cover-ups that I have learned about firsthand over the years literally infuriate me.

And I hope it infuriates you, because these authorities, these nit-wits in high positions of power who are proceeding to spend all the money the American people make for their own use, their own private programs, and then lie through their teeth about what the truth really is.

Well, thanks to the idea that there were a few employees in NASA 40 years ago – even today there are some good people working there, decent people, honest people – I have some film that they preserved, that was not destroyed.

Gentlemen, put up the next picture for me. [applause]

This is a NASA photo. This is Apollo 12, Apollo Systems 12, roll number 50, negative number 7348. They were flying over the Moon before they landed. They went into orbit around the moon, as many of you know. I’m sure this is no secret. They went into orbit around the Moon and, while they were there in orbit around the Moon, a number of anomalous artifacts began showing up showing interest in them. Next picture, please.

Ah, this picture was taken by Neil Armstrong. While looking out of their window of their little craft, this object flew by. There is the moon in the background, of course, below the object that flew by the window of that little craft that they were riding in. Neil took the Hasselblad camera that he had, put it up to the window and snapped this picture. Next picture, please.

Ah, NASA Apollo 12, roll 51, negative 8653, something like that. Now this is a good-sized object. This is several hundred feet in diameter that came up next to the Lander and flew along beside them for a time. The guys in the Apollo craft put their camera to the window and snapped the thing, and I’ve always jokingly said there were guys inside of this, taking pictures of the NASA craft. We were photographing them; they were photographing us. Next picture, please.

Photo NASA Apollo Systems number 14 – Apollo 14 – roll 70, negative, what is it -- 9837 or 9887? This is the Lansberg crater on the moon. The guys in orbit above the Moon were particularly fascinated by Lansberg. They had been given a special assignment to take pictures of Lansberg, because the crater, which they designated as the Lansberg, had things going on in the crater that were very anomalous. There was construction going on. There were enormous facilities in the crater up there.

So they were specifically designated and assigned to photograph Lansberg to see if they could figure out what the hell was going on down there in the crater on Lansberg. While they were looking at Lansberg, this object happened to express interest in them and flew by. Now this line is an artificial line that was drawn to show you the … it gave the direction that this object was going. This is a good-size object flying past the Apollo Lander.

God, I’m so glad that some of these were saved. I still get angry, 40 rolls of film, for Christ’s sake, and they erased them. Anyhow, next picture, please.

This is the same photo of Lansberg, but the next negative, 9838 of this object here flying by. Next picture.

Ah, now we’re getting into some nitty-gritty. I want to give you just a brief little bit of history here. Back in the early days of NASA and the Apollo programs, I got this picture from the Japanese space agency, the Japanese NASA. They have a tremendous program going over there in Japan. You know the Japanese are bright people.

The Japanese space agency signed a contract with NASA years and years ago, to buy copies of every picture NASA took during the Apollo Program. And I’m sure the Japanese people paid a sizeable amount of money for this contract. And as the films were developed and the photos were made, they shipped them off to Japan and the Japanese had a tremendous reservoir of goods of regional NASA pictures. They bought them. They paid for them. So this photograph was released by the Japanese space agency; you can see the Japanese writing here.

This was taken by Apollo 13. Now, you’re all familiar, I’m sure, with Apollo 13. That was the aborted mission that was going to the moon to land and they had an accident on the way. They couldn’t land. They damned well barely got back.

While they were on the way to the moon – here’s the moon – a number of things began happening. Some strange objects were appearing outside the windows of the spacecraft so the guys grabbed their Hasselblad cameras and start taking pictures.

This photograph shows three different objects. This looks like a circular object with an enlarged dome on top. This is a smaller object with a circular kind of disc-shaped craft, but coming in from the right margin of this picture is this. Next picture, please.

Here we are. This is a blowup of the positive in the photograph and here is a blowup of the negative of this object here. Ladies and gentlemen, this particular object is five miles long. I’m tempted to use the term big mother. No pun intended because it appears to be a mother ship. It’s gigantic, five miles long and here are these NASA guys are up there in this little cramped Apollo capsule, and they look out their window and they see something that is five miles long. It shakes them up a little bit. And when it got back to NASA, these pictures shook them up a hell of a lot. Next picture, please.

Ah, this is the next sequence. Here this large mother has moved into the middle of the frame and something else has come up over here, which has been estimated to be two miles long. But this really upset the guys. I have never been able to find out which one of the three Apollo members of the Apollo 13 group would admit to ever having taken these pictures.

So, as you know, the Apollo astronauts were threatened with their lives, I kid you not. They were threatened seriously. They even threatened their families if they ever divulged any of the information that they knew. Next photo, please.

Here we are. Here’s the big mother; here’s the other one two miles long. Here’s a picture of the positive; this is the negative. This mother is five miles long. Up here you can see what appear to be two circular objects, either arriving or departing from that particular big ship.

I can almost understand why the authorities in NASA, why the authorities in the space program didn’t want this information to come out. They were frightened; they were stumped; they couldn’t deal with it themselves and they figured, if they couldn’t handle it, you couldn’t handle it.

There would be social disruption; I believe is one of the terms they used. They would disturb the body politic; I believe the term they used. So they clamped the lid down on this and it is still down and it is going to stay down, I’m afraid, for some time yet, until people like yourselves and me and the rest of the people here on this stage, by pushing and prodding and chipping away at this lie and the secrecy, until, eventually, we will succeed. And, don’t you doubt that for a minute.

[applause]

Ah, now I’m in for another photograph which I think will shock you some. In 1980, NASA -- Never A Straight Answer -- launched the Voyager program to Saturn. They launched this little mechanical space ship filled with cameras, film and so on. They wanted to go to Saturn because something had been going on in the rings of Saturn, around the moons of Saturn that didn’t make a lot of sense. Some anomalous events were taking place in Saturn, near Saturn, at Saturn.

So they launched the Voyager in 1980. The pictures they got back from Voyager was so stunning and so shocking that they just locked them up in a safe. Fortunately I met and developed a friendship with a retired NASA scientist by the name of Norman Bergrun.

Norman Bergrun worked for NASA for about 30 years. He was a technician, a scientist on the Voyager Program to Saturn in 1980. Norman decided, after waiting a number of years for NASA and the authorities to be candid and honest and forthright and tell what they really found up at Saturn. And Norman got so frustrated he wrote a book. [Ed Note: The Ringmakers of Saturn]

I think he couldn’t publish in the United States; no American publisher would even touch it. Norman Bergrun had to go to Scotland, for God’s sake, to Aberdeen, to get his book published. And he published it. He did succeed. He got his book. It’s a piece of genius; it’s a beautiful piece of work, and the things that they photographed near Saturn appeared in print for the first time.

This is the A-ring of Saturn. I think you’re all familiar with what Saturn looks like; it’s a beautiful planet. It’s a giant, but it’s got rings all around it. Well this is the A-ring and here’s the object that is self-luminous, obviously artificial, larger than our moon, that seems to be moving all around throughout the rings of Saturn and among the moons of Saturn; and Saturn’s got a couple dozen moons.

This object here, as I said, larger than our moon, moving all around apparently under intelligent control in the rings of Saturn. Now, try for a moment, if you can, to imagine the kind of a technology that is capable of constructing something larger than our moon, that’s artificial, that moves around wherever it wishes to go that has probably got several thousand guys inside. That is shocking to some people. Next picture , please.

Ah, this is the pièce de résistance, I guess, as the French say. Here you have another self-luminous, artificially constructed object, circular in shape, larger than our moon that is also moving here, there and everywhere throughout the rings of Saturn and among the moons of Saturn. You know, there has to be intelligence aboard.

But this is the one that really blew the NASA people on the Voyager program out of the water. This object – this is an object guys – is 2000 miles long. It’s 400 miles in diameter, and it is an artificially constructed… Norman calls them an electromagnetic vehicle. He says they appear to be making the rings. This is one of the rings of Saturn; I think this is B-ring. Bergrun says he thought they were probably making the rings. I said: Norman, you have to consider the possibility they may be mining the rings.

I think the rings are probably rich in nutrients, in minerals probably, and an incredibly advanced civilization I think would work out some system of mining those rings for all the minerals up there and utilizing them because space is filled with wealth; energies of all kinds. They never have to dig another hole in the ground like we do down here. Space is filled with energy.

This is 2000 miles long and here on this end, there seems to be something like an exhaust or a flare of energy of some kind. It’s probably the result of engines of some type inside this thing; but, whatever it’s doing, it’s there, and it’s a recognition and representation of an advanced intelligence.

And that’s one of the things that they don’t want you to know -- that we are confronting and relating with an intelligence that’s so far beyond our own; we’re looking at and talking about what’s known as a Type II civilization.

Now, for your own interest -- I suspect most of you suspect this -- but you are all members of a zero-zero-type civilization. Beyond us, hopefully in a century or two, we might become a Type I. But this is a representation of the Type II civilization.

Michio Kaku, the famous Japanese-American physicist in New York, has put out this concept about Type II, 0, I, II, III and IV of the kind of advanced cultures and civilizations we will probably meet out there. Well, we’ll probably meet out there; we have already met them. They’re here; they’re in our midst.

[Ed note: The Type I through IV civilizations were first conceived by a Russian, Nikolai Kardashev]

So, I brought about 15 or 20 of these pictures but I simply have no time; I don’t have the time to show them all. So I’ve shown a few here and I think I’ve piqued your curiosity. And, I think most of you are pretty bright people and you know you’ve been conned. You know you have been lied to. You’re not fools and I think you know who you are and why you’re here and where you’re going.

[applause] Next photograph, please.

Ah, this is a photograph taken by our Mariner space vehicle that we launched back a number of years ago. This is a picture of a facility on the surface of Mars. Now, this facility is located on the equator, and it’s on the surface, and those of us who have studied it and discussed it with each other, call it the airport.

I said this is the parking lot (oval flat area). This is the administration building here (raised semi-circular area adjacent to the left of the oval); this is the main terminal here (structure directly behind the oval flat area), and I imagine it is a pretty busy facility, you know, with ships coming and going, but it’s not an airport.

It is very likely a spaceport. It is on the surface and it’s on the equator of Mars. And if you are ever interested in launching a vehicle from a planet, you put it on the equator and you take advantage of the rotation of the planet to assist in the launching of your vehicle. You can take the momentum of the movement of the planet and it helps you get the thing off the ground. So, it’s exactly on the equator; it’s on the surface and it’s massive in size.

So maybe that is the parking lot; I don’t know. Maybe that is the admin building, but there is something going on, on Mars, and I’ve been going back and forth with Richard Hoagland now for years, where Richard, who I know most of you are aware of, is convinced that Mars is covered with ruins. Well it is. But it is not just ruins. There are things going on, on that planet; on the surface, under the surface, continually so. Next picture, please.

Ah, this was published in a German magazine but this is a Soviet photo. This is from their Phobos 2 spacecraft. This is a city under the surface of Mars that is the size of Chicago. Chicago is one of our biggest cities. Several million people live in Chicago.

This is under the surface. You can see the city block … breakdown here portions of the neighborhoods here or whatever it is, but it is generating an enormous amount of heat. And they picked this up on the infrared when Phobos was going around the planet snapping pictures like crazy.

The Soviets were pretty open about releasing some of their photos, contrary to the United States, where lying has become a fine art. Don’t get me started on my politicians. Phobos 2, the city on Mars, under the surface; you can see the streets, Broadway, First Avenue, whatever.
People have said, well, who’s there?
And I says: For God sake, it’s the Martians who are there!
What a silly question to ask: Who’s there?

[applause] Next photo, please.

Now, I love this picture - Earth. I love this lady. Your ancestors and mine called her Gaia. She was feminine. She was a goddess. She was sacred. This beautiful lady has a respiratory system, she has a circulatory system and she has a heart.

She is our source of life on this planet. We needed her. We need her now. We wouldn’t be here if it were not for her. We talk about holy lands: Mecca, Jerusalem, here, there, everywhere. That is the holy land, people -- that beloved planet that we are on. Next picture, please.

I spoke to you earlier about the fact that your grandchildren, great-grandchildren and so on -- the generations yet to come -- have their destiny in the stars. And meantime, they will go out there and claim their rightful place in that infinite community of life. You can believe that and you can accept that with an assuredness and truth that goes beyond doubt.

The destiny of this species and this race, this troublesome clan of monkeys, is in the stars and there is your destiny. I want you to understand that and have some hope, and don’t get depressed, because you are going to be undergoing some very difficult times in a few years left ahead.

We are going through this transition, this transformation, this transcendent transformation into another species, into another race. And, if you remember your own adolescence, it was a painful time. The species, the race, is going through adolescence, but we’re not alone. We’re getting helpers.

We have family out there that’s helping us and they’ve been helping us for a long time. They’ve been trying to encourage us and nourish us and trying to point the right direction for us to go, because we are a troublesome adolescent children, and we are going through that transformation. But my point is that there is no doubt about the inevitable destiny and truth of the human race.

Now, I want to quote something for you if you’ll bear with me here. One of my favorite authors, poets, was a man I’ve admired for years: Count Leo Tolstoy. Tolstoy said that there is something in the human spirit that will survive and will prevail. That will survive and prevail and there is a tiny brilliant light burning brightly in the heart of man that will not go out no matter how dark the world becomes.

And in the years ahead when things are difficult and economic problems take place, there will still be disruptions, fear, hope; sadly enough, I’m afraid, there will still be blood in the streets, here, there, and everywhere. This coming out of adolescence is not an easy process. But then what do you do when you leap beyond adolescence? You reach adulthood. You grow up. And we’re growing up.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, my journey is coming to an end, but for many of you out there your journey has just begun. And I want to show something to you before I leave the stage this afternoon. No matter how dark the world becomes, you can be sure, as Tolstoy said, there is a spark, there is a flame burning in your heart that will never go out no matter how dark the world becomes.

And as my journey is coming to a close, and for some of you your journey is just beginning, I wanted to say to you in a term that I think is absolutely appropriate – you Spaniards have got some beautiful terms in your words – Vaya con Dios. [Ed. note: Go with God]

[applause]

I’ve never been to Spain before, but it’s one of my favorite places. I love you guys, and now I’m learning to love the Spaniards. In Italian I learned to say this and I will say it to you and I understand you know the meaning. In closing I want to say to you all: Keom [Ed. note: phoenetic!]

[applause]

Kerry Cassidy (KC): Everyone, I’m Kerry Cassidy, from Project Camelot.

This is Henry Deacon.

Henry has something he wants to say to Bob. Bob? This is Henry Deacon and we just want to say something here. This is Henry Deacon from Project Camelot for those of you who are familiar with our website. He’s here today, and he’s here at the conference. He has something he’d like to say, Bob, about Mars.

Henry Deacon (HD): I don’t have any words, but Bob has expressed everything that I would have said and I can confirm, because I’ve been working in Top Secret for 30 years at above Top Secret. We share a common background, but I just met him recently here and I can only say that: Yes, there’s life on Mars. There are bases on Mars. I’ve been there.

[applause]

BD: I didn’t even get started in telling you some of the things that I wanted to share this afternoon about who and what is on the moon, and Mars that Henry knows.

HD: It’s a long story, as he said. There is not time to put it all together. Except that it’s a positive story, it’s not one of fear. He showed a picture of Mother Earth and it’s giving birth and there are birth pangs, but there is a child that is being born. And just forget about the fear, because that’s just really a temporary thing.

KC: There she is.

HD: So a friend of mine, Angelica, who no one knows, she calls this the emerald planet and it’s alive. Yes, it’s very much alive. We’re a part of that lithe life form and life spreads throughout this whole galaxy and the rest of our family is watching and waiting, and helping quietly behind the scenes. And I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to meet family that don’t just live here on terra for a long, long time even before I was in government work, so thank you.

KC: Thank you. Henry Deacon, for those of you who don’t know …

BD: Ladies and gentlemen … am I still broadcasting here?

Announcer: You’re still broadcasting.

Audience: Tell us about Mars and the moon. Screw the breaks. [Kerry laughs]

BD: I’m going to share a small story with you before I run out of time and I’m going to ask the gentlemen to please bear with me and give me just a few moments. [applause]

This is for Hoagland. [laughter] I attended my son’s retirement ceremony in Washington D.C. in November. My boy retired in November in Washington as a Full Captain in the United States Navy after 30 years of service. And while I was at this retirement party, the room was filled with Admirals and Generals and retired Commanders and Captains and so on. And we all had something cool in our hands and we were all moving around each other amiably and relaxed, you know.

A retired navy scientist, whose name must remain untold, came up to me, nudged me and said: I know you.

And I said: Yes, I’m Eric’s father.

No, no, no., he said: I know you. You’re that notorious retired Command Sergeant Major with the big mouth.

And I said: Yes, I’ll go with that.

He said: I have to share something with you before the party is over.

He said: I retired several years ago. My last job was at a government laboratory in Nevada a few miles from Las Vegas. I'm a plasma fusion physicist; that’s my expertise. That’s my training, my background, my occupation.

Not being a scientist, I go: What? What? A plasma fusion physicist?

He said: Yeah. I worked at this laboratory outside of Las Vegas. It’s not commonly known; it’s fairly secret. I worked five years with two guys who are not from here. They were from somewhere else. They were delightful people. They were scientists; they were working with us. They were assisting us. They were encouraging us and offering us ideas and possibilities and one thing and another in plasma fusion, which is infinite energy forever.

And he says: I got to know them pretty well. He says: After a couple of years I went up to one of them and I said, “What do you guys really think of us human beings?”

And this chap from somewhere said: "Well, since you’ve asked, we think you are – how did he word it? – A primitive, savage, and dangerous race." [laughter]

And the scientist said: I had to agree with him. We are. We are a primitive, savage and dangerous race at the moment.

The other chap was standing there who had been listening in. He was also from somewhere else. He said, “You also smell bad. [laughter] You humans stink. Nothing personal, mind you. We find that you don’t smell good.”

And the scientist said: My first thought was, you know, I didn’t spray under my arms this morning, maybe.

And they tried to explain that we humans have a psychic odor about us that they pick up and they find it terribly offensive. So it hit me between the eyes because, when I was a boy growing up, my grandmother used to say: If we could only see ourselves as others see us.

It would help so much to develop our integrity and our character and all that, and this remark of my grandmother hit me that we were getting this so-called from the horse’s mouth from one of our extended family out there that: you’re primitive, savage and dangerous, but you also stink.

I thought that was humorous and I shared that with Gogo and she said: Please include that in your presentation. So Gogo, bless your heart. I did that for you, you know.

Goodnight everybody. [applause]

HD:  One sentence. It relates directly to what Bob has said. If you want contact, raise your spirit high. That’s what they want because they don’t want to mix with you if you’re savage beasts. It’s that simple. Just relax and be happy and work with each other. It’s a very simple message.

BD: Thank you, Henry.

HD:  Thank you. [applause]

KC: If you want to learn more about Henry Deacon, he's on our site. We have a lot of very long transcripts all about who he is, some of where he worked, and about Mars. We also have a video called Jumproom to Mars, in which David Wilcock, Bill Ryan and I discuss some of what he told us. We’re looking for, maybe a fifteen-minute, maybe half-hour tomorrow when Henry Deacon can address you and maybe tell you some of the details. Thank you.

BD: Let me add one more sentence. [laughter] I must add this. I have traveled all over the planet and I have spoken to conferences all over the world and all over the United States. I have never been to a conference of this nature without there being at least one, and generally two, of the others in the audience.

I want you all to think about that and look around you and know that in your midst... [laughter] you have good friends in high places, and they’re in your midst, and I’ve learned over the years to recognize them.

HD: It’s your family.

BD: Exactly, they’re family. But like Ingo Swann, I’ve developed the intuitive ability to spot them and recognize them and now I have them coming up to me at conferences, introducing themselves to me. There are no limits. Life is infinite and forever. God bless all of you, and I will tell you goodbye this time.

## Jake Simpson Report (another good one)

https://projectavalon.net/lang/en/jake_simpson_en.html

On return to Europe from the 2008 NEXUS Conference in Australia, flying out of Sydney, we stopped off in Thailand to visit a close friend who lives on the island of Koh Samui. Samui is well known as a travelers' international crossroads, and is also a place where a number of expats of all nationalities have settled.

There we had the good fortune to meet Jake Simpson [an agreed pseudonym]. We spent several days with him and got to know him, and his family, very well. His story, which we heard in great detail, was one of the most important and interesting we have ever heard.

None of the many long conversations we had were recorded, and we hope to capture an audio interview with Jake soon. The following concise summary was compiled upon return to the US, and has been checked for accuracy by Jake himself.

For reasons which will become obvious, we were at first quite unsure whether to release this at all. After a great deal of thought, and further consultation with Jake, we decided to make this information available. Assuming it is true - and we believe that it is - it could hardly be more significant. It dovetails with everything else we know. And in many ways, we wish that it did not.

Much of what follows is barely believable, so this may be its own best defense. Those who choose not to believe this information at all can relax - just a little, and maybe for a little while - with the knowledge that none of it can currently be proved. For the benefit of those whose jobs it is to monitor this information, we do not have any documentation of any kind. We are delighted, however, to consider Jake a close friend. We are absolutely certain that he is exactly who he says he is, and have talked with a number of people who have known him for many years.

In the report that follows, exact written quotes from Jake himself are presented indented and in italics, as in this closing paragraph.

Enhanced abilities

Jake Simpson was in a 'specialist field' [his preferred term] working for a nation friendly to the US. His early training, which is still with him, featured an enhancement of his ability to absorb written information. Incredibly, he has a reading speed of between 80,000 and 100,000 words per minute. To graduate from that class, he was given a copy of George Orwell's Animal Farm and had three minutes to read it before being tested on every detail. He scored 90%. This was adequate for a pass, but was not the highest score... another student scored 100%.

Jake is a very able psychic intuitive to this day. He is able to perceive when the AI [artificial intelligence] information gathering system was 'focused' in his direction and would periodically pick his exact moment to relate something to us. We observed this again and again. While it at all times seemed the same to us, sometimes Jake told us it was safe to talk, while at other times it was not. It took a little while for us to understand exactly what was going on here.

See below for more on this. We have not heard this information anywhere else in the literature, on the internet, or mentioned by any other witness. But I [Bill] had one experience that showed me directly that this was very real indeed.

Approaching Project Camelot 

Jake had written to us by way of introduction:

I have spent many years previously working in abstract areas of national security on behalf of the various parties concerned. I have been very impressed by some of your interviewees' comments. Keep up the outstanding work.

Jake approached Project Camelot after our work had been brought to his attention by a friend. At first, he wasn't convinced that we were 'real'. However, his connections enabled him to do the requisite background checks, and he told us that it soon became clear that we passed muster.

He told us he knew everything about us, but that we had "nothing to worry about". Everyone who had ever tried to do something like we were doing before, apparently, had been killed. He told us he'd watched every one of our videos, admired what we did, and that we had a lot of courage. He assured us that some of what we have reported is very close to the truth, and that we had his respect.

Jake is one of many in military/ intelligence circles who are the 'white hats'. Idealistically motivated, he made his career choice when young, wanting to work for mankind and play his part in helping Planet Earth become a better place. Despite discovering the true, bewildering complexity of the world he had entered, he retained both his idealism and his job... and many years later decided to approach Project Camelot with a portion of what he now knew.

He told us that we had many of the correct puzzle pieces - and that, furthermore, it was understood that we work with integrity, and that we're not trying to breach any legitimate national security. He stressed that we were quite liked by a number of the 'white hats' who were monitoring us closely, despite our being on a number of 'watch lists' of every kind.

Jake helped us understand that if we kept our information general and didn't try to prove anything (with documentation or by any other means), we would remain safe. He stressed that it was very important not to get too specific on certain sensitive issues, and to be very wary of ever getting hold of any definitive documentation.

Classified technology and the secret space program

Jake emphasized to us that the current state of classified technology was something like 10,000 [ten thousand] years ahead of public sector technology - and was accelerating away from public sector technology at a current rate of 1,000 years per calendar year.

This got our attention.

Jake did not blink when we mentioned time travel, the Mars base, or the advanced fleet of craft which we had been told by Henry Deacon serviced it. Jake told us that some of the advanced craft were capable of traveling from geostationary orbit (22,300 miles) to treetop height in five seconds. (Work it out: that's about 16 million miles per hour - although Jake made it clear that the craft would not actually be moving through space in the normal sense... and would also never be seen unless this was intended.) Some of the craft were "larger on the inside than outside".

Had they traveled to the outer reaches of the solar system? Yes. Beyond our solar system? Yes. Are some of them superluminal (i.e. capable of faster-than-light travel)? Yes. Were some of them very large? Yes. By this time, we were no longer surprised by Jake's answers. The significance of the superluminal craft would be stressed in a subsequent conversation.

The human race had had contact with extraterrestrials since before World War II. Jake told us that it was very probable that Eisenhower's 1955 heart attack was at least partially induced by the stress of some of the information he had learned from the extraterrestrials who he had personally met a short time before (after several previous set-up meetings with senior military officials).

Taken all together, Jake told us, the ET visitors came from various races, systems and times, and that human DNA "was compatible" with hundreds of different races. All these ET races, in some meaningful sense, could be said to be "human or human-like”.

AI surveillance and access to knowledge

The AI surveillance system, Jake told us, was literally "out of this world". It operates hyperdimensionally, based on a highly advanced quantum computing model that is basically our development based on acquired alien technology. This system is so advanced that the ETs themselves are unhappy that we have it.

Not only does it enable access to what any given person is saying, or even thinking - if targeted for investigation - it can also transcend time itself and thereby access information about the thoughts and words of historical figures. Whether this system can look into the future - the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report, based on a story by the prolific author Philip K. Dick, comes to mind - we omitted to ask.

Jake's actions in being sensitive to this device (if device is the right word) - by waiting for exactly the right 'window' of opportunity to tell us certain things - were not fully understood by us until I (Bill Ryan) had the following experience.

On our last night together, sitting out in the open after a barbecue, at about 2 am, Jake decided to tell me some things he had not previously revealed, surveillance or no surveillance. As he began to speak, he immediately encountered problems, as if trying to force himself through a barrier. Simultaneously, I found I was being put to sleep and could hardly keep my eyes open. We both spotted what was happening, and remarked on it to one another.

Jake forced himself to keep talking, and I made myself keep listening through a spell of overwhelming dopiness. This episode lasted half an hour or maybe more. We were being forcibly stopped, in real time, from communicating effectively, as a direct and immediate response to our intentions.

It's very important to understand that this was unconnected with electromagnetics, hidden microphones, targeted beams, or anything else of that nature. My own reference point for what happened was a kind of negative radionics (which also works hyperdimensionally, but as a positive health modality).

In the end we concluded our conversation, now pretty tired. The next morning I simply could not recall what Jake had told me - and still can't. Upon meeting him again and reporting that I couldn't remember a thing about our conversation except for the weird effects we had both experienced, he replied wryly:

Maybe it's just as well.

The biggest secret

The international network of deep underground bases, Jake confirmed, had been built in a continuing program since soon after the end of World War II costing trillions of dollars. The issue here was that military leaders had learned through ET contact that a potential catastrophe of huge magnitude, occurring early in the 21st century, was possible. This information was certainly known to Eisenhower, Jake said (and may have been partially responsible for his heart attack), and was very possibly known as early as World War II.

Just as we had presented in our important summary article The Big Picture, the problem is one which involves massive potential Earth changes that could, in extremis, threaten our civilization. The situation had been extensively studied and evaluated and the conclusion had been reached that the public could not be told. 

Jake described the threat - metaphorically - as a wave that was heading our way. It was unclear whether this 'wave' is a product of an area of space which the solar system is entering - or whether it is the result of a close fly-past by a large rogue celestial body, or even a combination of two or three simultaneous situations or other unusual and impending cosmological events. But when I asked how this is all known, the answer came back that the superluminal craft have gone out to take a good look at what is around, and have returned with the information.

Jake stressed that IT IS NOT KNOWN what the effects of this situation will be, nor precisely when this may occur. The military are preparing for worst case scenarios, which is what they do best. Readers familiar with our work will note the connection with the report from the Norwegian Politician, and also Dan Burisch's information which culminates in the report on Timeline 1, variant 83 [T1v83].

Of particular interest is the contradiction with the T1v83 information, in which Dan told us that in the latter half of 2007 a highly classified time portal intelligence retrieval project (for lack of any better phrase) had analyzed a number of possible alternative future timelines and concluded that variant 83 - the most probable of the many that had been investigated - demonstrated that the 'Timeline 2' catastrophe had been averted and that while civilization would not be under threat, the next few years would bring major problems. These included nuclear exchanges in a prolonged period of global conflict, under an administration in which Hillary Clinton had been elected President of the US.

Since that information was researched - a year ago at the time of writing this article - it has become very clear that that timeline variant has been 'broken', and that we are now instead hurtling along on another, uncharted timeline. In Dan's words to us a few months ago, "All bets are off" - and when we put Dan's phrase to Jake, he responded:

That's about right. I wouldn't disagree with that at all.

Jake's information is that it had never been certain that the catastrophe had been averted, and he confirmed that the governments of many first-world nations were continuing to make their detailed and extensive preparations. Australia, we were told, was the "Ark of the World", and had been designated as such many years previously.

Jake confirmed that he had personally seen some of the classified maps showing dramatically altered future coastlines, and also confirmed the possibility of a very advanced high-speed 'shuttle-like' system that connected many places, like the US and Australia under the Pacific Ocean - a longstanding but always uncorroborated rumor within the UFO community that had acquired semi-mythological status since the startling reports of John Lear and William Cooper in the late 1980s. Jake told us that

...the acceleration presses you back into your seat for a very long time.

This has all happened before

One of the most startling snippets of information Jake revealed was that in some locations the base construction engineers had broken through into much older facilities that had been there for thousands of years prior - apparently built for an identical defensive purpose. All this, Jake had told us, had happened before: the catastrophic events are cyclic.

Because of what had been learned through breaking into older facilities built by a prior Earth culture, in some locations decisions had been made to increase the depth of the new facilities to as much as 30,000 feet [9000 meters]. 

The great classified libraries of the world, in the Vatican and elsewhere, all contained detailed accounts of the destruction of prior civilizations. The Flood Myth, as many anthropologists have described, is evident in many dozens of different cultures all over the world. All this is described in our article The Big Picture.

The threat of stealth viruses

These catastrophic events, Jake told us, would happen not in 2012 but several years after that, though the dates were not precisely known. When we put Bob Dean's date of 2017 to him (in the context of the coming of Nibiru), Jake's response is that that would be close, as best he knew.

More immediate, said Jake, was the threat of the deliberate release of viruses followed by

...the hideous effects of spontaneous eruptions of new generations of opportunistic bacteria like Necrotizing Fasciitis and more advanced versions of golden staphylococci which would further reduce the world's population after the initial first line of worldwide disasters had occurred.

This would trigger worldwide infrastructure breakdown, cause chaos, and make populations easier to control.

Jake predicted that it was quite possible that sometime before the end of 2009 - or possibly early 2010 - there would be a sudden and rapid escalation of international reported outbreaks of extremely dangerous viruses (whether manmade or otherwise). He emphasized that announcements of a global pandemic could suddenly emerge from nowhere "within hours", and that it would be smart to be prepared: he stressed that some countries could quickly become quarantined, or choose to quarantine themselves, with major implications for international travel and port or airport controls.

Coupled with these outbreaks there will be a very real possibility of food shortages. Even more importantly, there will very likely be shortages of quality foods containing all of the necessary levels of active and absorbable vitamins and minerals of the necessary types, and in the right or proportional quantities, to allow for the human body to properly and adequately nourish itself.

These shortfalls and omissions of some of the fundamental basic substances of various foods will prevent people's immune systems from operating at optimum levels, thus leaving them exposed to these new virulent types of diseases. This will leave literally hundreds of millions of people exposed to disease vectors through 2011-2012 onwards.

Technological access to other dimensions

Finally, Jake told us of research that had unlocked technology surrounding access to other dimensional states of existence.

In these other alternate states of reality sometimes it turns out they can very briefly and spontaneously manifest, very occasionally quite naturally, here on Earth and in any other part of this universe. In very special circumstances, these can spontaneously manifest across not only this universe but indeed into alternative universal realities.

There is a massive amount of research funding being applied to this very obscure part of the broad spectrum of the special access programs of the world’s budgetary allowance for these types of programs. These funds are managed and funneled from every imaginable area of the majority of the world’s countries through an amazing array of abstract instrumentalities and public funding projects.

The research involved with this subject is at the top of the world’s power elite's priorities. This is why there are very selective sightings of some of the largest scientific programs, currently ongoing across the world.

The geographical location (in three dimensions) is absolutely critical in some special cases. Jake wrote:

The Earth’s specific rotation is also of consideration and its relationship to the sun and the other planetary bodies contained within our solar system - especially the larger ones. There are very many localized effects experienced subtly, here on Earth in the course of a year, in relation to the specific location to other localized celestial bodies, apart from our sun, contained within and without the heliosphere.

On a larger scale, the position of our solar system in relation to our galaxy is also of vital importance. Jake's words again:

Our galaxy’s position, speed and direction relative to several neighboring galaxies is also important. Beyond this is an understanding of a technology that not only allows for absolute universal travel and capitalization of the fantastic power that entails, but provides the ability to move or travel dimensionally.

Jake explained that this knowledge is essential to the next phase in 'Earth human' development...

...if we Earth humans are ever to be freed from this particular part of existence and universal / multiversal constraints.

Jake stated that as in every aspect of human history here on Earth, there have been supporters, detractors and outright enemies...

...both on Earth and not from Earth. Nothing much has changed over all these eons of time. The play is still largely the same with all of the same motives and allegiances.

The pursuit by some at the expense of the many seems to always end up to be the ultimate price, along with the loss of the Individual and Eternal Grand Self/ Soul/ Spirit, particularly when the individual sells out all that is sacred to the ongoing existence of our race.

As Jake explained, some of these power elite's motives constituted

...a viable and sustainable level of a heavily manicured and vastly reduced human population, under the pretence of saving first the planet, and next the vast majority of all of the other diverse range of different species here on Earth.

Jake told us that it had been explained to him:

"You have to break a few eggs in order to create a really great meal. The Destroyer of Worlds [sic] brings with it the promise of massively renewed and clean prolific growth for yet another new direction in Earth Human evolution. Roaches will always be roaches. Someone’s got to keep them under control.”

The quote reminded us of Henry Deacon's reported briefing in which he had been ordered to read The Report From Iron Mountain, and had been told: “There are the wolves and there are the sheep, and we are the wolves.”

Jake said that what he had been told was highly disturbing to him, and stressed just how at odds he ultimately was

...with the paramount agenda of a significant element of the absolute power elite.

Jake’s strong personal ethics and morality always prevented him from receiving the rich benefits that he told us he knew could have been his. He told us he was

...happy to remain obscure while still contributing where appropriate to assist humankind in meaningful and positive ways.

We gained the impression that the power elite have largely left Jake alone. It was evident to us that he has an intimate knowledge of their culture and knows how to ensure his and his family's safety.

We close here with this remarkable man's own words:

This suggests an even more powerful, off-world group or association that I may have a very special relationship with, that is lending a very discreet helping hand... where possible.

 

We are hopeful that we might record a voice-disguised audio interview with Jake, and although this has been discussed it has not yet been arranged or agreed. We will post more information as soon as we can.

We thank our friend here for his courage in providing this remarkable testimony. Kerry and I are as certain as we can be that this man is both well-informed and has the highest integrity.
