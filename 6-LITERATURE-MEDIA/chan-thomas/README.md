Published a book "The Adam and Eve Story" which was classified by the CIA. They released a sanitized version of it in 2013. Chapter 6 was entirely removed from the sanitized version and covers Chan's cataclysm theory. [1]

## Measuring cataclysm moment

How do you know when it is time for a cataclysm? 
The answer is simple. Go to a store soon where you can 
purchase a top-quality magnetic compass, one wherein 
you can lock the free north-south indicating needle in 
any position you desire. The bigger it is, the better off 
you are. Then purchase an accurate stopwatch. 

Take them home and put them by your bedside. 
Have a paper under the compass with two diameters 
marked off at 90 degrees to each other in a circle larger 
than the diameter of your compass. Put your compass 
on the paper, centered within the circle. Unlock the 
compass needle and set it on north. Set the compass 
case so that its north coincides with the compass 
needle, and place the paper underneath so that one of 
its diameters is on the north-south line of the compass 
needle and the compass case. Tape the paper in place. 
Put the compass back so that its needle is pointed 
north, along the north-south line on the paper 
underneath. Then to bed and have a good night's sleep. 


In the morning, hold the compass steadily as it is 
positioned in the circle beneath it, and lock the needle 
in place. Then turn the compass case left or right 90 
degrees; use the 90-degree line on the paper underneath 
as a guide. Hold the case absolutely still, then release 
the needle. The needle will then swing toward north, 
and oscillate back and forth, diminishing in its swing 
alittle each time. With the stopwatch, observe the time 
necessary for the compass needle to stop oscillating 
from its release time to first quiet settled-down time. 

There will come the day, if indeed we are going to 
enter the galaxy's magnetic null zone as soon as the 
mathematics tables indicate we will, that you will find 
the settling down time increasing, as the needle's 
oscillations will become sluggish. It could be that the 
time for settling down will stay nearly the same, but the 
number of oscillations required for the needle to settle 
down will decrease. So, perhaps in addition to recording 
the stopwatch time duration, also record the number 
of oscillations required for the needle to settle down. 
Either way, you will discern by your data that indeed, 
the Earth's magnetic field strength has decreased to a 
critical level. NOW! Take your family and your entire 
survival storage to your retreat.
