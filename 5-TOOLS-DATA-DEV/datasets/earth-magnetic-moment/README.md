# Earth Magnetic Moment Data

`filtered-pole.tab.txt` contains the raw data for the Earth's magnetic dipole moment going back to 1900. The values are vastly higher now than they were 124 years ago, and getting larger by the week.

## Data format

1900.00 | -0.006572 | -0.047339   
2024.25 | 0.132844 | -0.347838 

They are the polar coordinates for the mean dipole moment expressed in radians. So the 1900 value is -0.3 degrees and the 2024 one is 19.9 degrees off axis from the geographic pole.
