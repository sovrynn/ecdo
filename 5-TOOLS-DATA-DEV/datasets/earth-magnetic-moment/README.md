# Earth Magnetic Moment Data

## Nobulart

Here's the raw data for the Earth's magnetic dipole moment going back to 1900. You can do a direct analysis on it same as I did, but anyone can see at a glance that the values are vastly higher now than they were 124 years ago, and getting larger by the week. I'll add the source here soon as I can find it again.

## Data format

1900.00         -0.006572         -0.047339   
2024.25          0.132844         -0.347838 

They are the polar coordinates for the mean dipole moment expressed in radians. So the 1900 value is -0.3 degrees and the 2024 one is 19.9 degrees off axis from the geographic pole.
