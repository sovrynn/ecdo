# ECDO (Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling - Dzhanibekov Oscillation)

This repo is intended to be a thoughtbank for brainstorming the [ECDO thesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2024/05/23/master-exothermic-core-mantle-decoupling-dzhanibekov-oscillation-theory/), created by the [Ethical Skeptic](https://theethicalskeptic.com/), and all things related to it.

Organization of the repo is mainly done through self-explanatory directory/file names. Information is written into Markdown (`.md`) files named `README.md`, and images/videos are placed into `img/` folders at each step of the directory tree.

Emphasis is placed on optimal data organization which minimizes redundancy and optimizes finding information.

## Main Folder Contents

Following are the main folders of the repo along with their purpose. There is bound to be some overlap but I have made the categories as discrete as possible.

1. `0-ORIGINAL-THESIS`: A container for describing Ethical Skeptic's original ECDO thesis.
2. `1-FULL-THEORY-BREAKDOWN`: A scientific derivation/proof of the ECDO thesis.
3. `2-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`: A collection of evidence of past ECDO events.
4. `3-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`: Information pertaining to the impending ECDO event.
5. `4-LOCATION-MAPPING`: Mapping out how different areas of the world will fare during an ECDO event.
6. `5-DANGERS-PREPPING`: All matters pertaining to preparing for an ECDO event aside from location.
7. `6-TOOLS-DATA-DEV`: Technical resources to help map out the ECDO event.

## How to Contribute

In order to contribute, you'll need to be able to use git.

The high-level steps are:
- clone the latest version of the repository to your local machine
- make a new git branch
- make your changes
- create a pull request

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

1. Put information in the proper location in the proper format
	- Information goes in the folder where it belongs and nowhere else. If a new folder needs to be made, do it in the proper location.
	- Folders and files should always be named properly, with concise and meaningful names. To put multiple words into a filename, connect the words with dashes (`-`). Names should always be lowercase, not camel case.
	- Text goes into `README.md` files, and graphic files into `img/` folders. Feel free to inline images into the Markdown.
2. Don't add noise
	- In order to make this repo as high signal as possible, avoid adding in sloppy analysis. Don't just copy paste things in, but add in useful analysis based on data.
	- Use English, with proper spelling and grammar.
	- When possible, add links and references.

## Additional Contribution Guidelines

Do NOT dump information into high-level `README.md` files just because you don't know where else to put it. `README.md` files are not data dumps but polished analysis of one specific topic. They should be organized and easily readable.

Some images are meaningful on their own, but others require explaining. Rather than use `img/` as an image dump, images should generally be referenced in Markdown and useful insights gleaned from them explained.

Information in other languages can be put in `/translation` folders within the relevant directory.

All pull requests will be reviewed to ensure optimal information structure.

## Embedding Images into Markdown

Two ways:
1. You can embed an image in Markdown using this snippet (replace `PATH` with the path to the image, for example `img/australia.jpg`). `alt` and `Title` are shown when the image fails to load and on hover, respectively:
	- `![alt](PATH "Title")`
2. You can also use HTML directly in Markdown if you want to change the size of the image. Use this snippet (replace `PATH` and `ALT` with desired values, as well as width):
	- `<img src="PATH" alt="ALT" style="width:50%;"/>`

There are text editors such as Visual Studio Code that allow you to preview Markdown (render it) to help you check for Markdown errors and style the README.md how you wish locally.
