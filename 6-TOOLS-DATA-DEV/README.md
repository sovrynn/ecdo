# Technical Tools

This folder is dedicated to tools, data, and development resources that help investigate the ECDO.

## Mapping

For elevation, [TessaDEM](https://tessadem.com/) is nice. Interactive web map is [here](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map/?center=14.43468%2C0.17578&popup=68.02073%2C175.78125).

Here is a decent interactive web [flooding map](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map/?center=14.43468%2C0.17578&popup=68.02073%2C175.78125).

Google Maps and Google Earth are excellent:
- Google Earth: https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/
- Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/d/
- Google Earth Scripting (need Google account): https://code.earthengine.google.com

## Other Tools

Ask Nobulart about these:
- KML: "Those files provide various feature overlays to the map. File menu > Open. ECDO paths can be drawn using the Measure > Circle tool. Draw a circle with the center on the nearest pivot to see the ECDO path. Some examples contained in the attached KML."
- False colour maps - STM15 digital elevation dataset (an add-on for GEP)
