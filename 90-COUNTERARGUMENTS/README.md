# Counterarguments

- SAA Qs:
	- SAA model overfit
	- why can SAA extent be used as a proxy for the flip?
- stuff underneath the Earth not properly understood yet
- marine fossils and sediment layer ages? How do we know they're not way older?
- if the 1st inertial axis flipped to the rotational axis, why would it ever flip more than 90 degrees? 90 degrees is the maximum displacement of another axis from the current rotational axis.
- not yet clear on the exact mechanism driving S1 -> S2 -> S1. Why is it so binary? Rotational changes should be more uniform and less quantized
- why do women not have the genetic bottleneck?

## Egypt's seeminngly conflicting evidence

So what I don't understand here is this account 

the truth of it lies
in the occurrence of a shifting of the bodies in the heavens
which move round the earth, and a destruction of the things
on the earth by fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals.
At such times all they that dwell on the mountains and in
high and dry places suffer destruction more than those who
dwell near to rivers or the sea; and in our case the Nile, our
Saviour in other ways, saves us also at such times from this
calamity by rising high. And when, on the other hand, the
Gods purge the earth with a flood of waters, all the herds-
men and shepherds that are in the mountains are saved, but
those in the cities of your land are swept into the sea by
the streams; whereas In our country neither then nor at any
other time does the water pour down over our fields from
above, on the contrary it all tends naturally to well up from
below. Hence it is, for these reasons, that what is here pre-
served is reckoned to be most ancient

This doesn't line up with the elevated erosion lines on the Khufu pyramid at first sight, which suggest violent submersion of Egypt

Finally you have that account of 2 flip-n-back sequences occuring in 341 generations of men, coupled with Plato's account of "many deluges since Atlantis"

What could make Egypt and Europe have such dramatically different experiences of the flip?

Finally you have China's Nuwa and Gun-Yu sequence. In Nuwa the land is mentioned as tilting to the southeast and the sky to the northwest, and in the Gun-Yu event, it isn't specified

## A physical gyroscopic "proof"

One of the things that's sorely missing is an actual physics model that can explain a stably rotating Earth flipping 104 degrees! (due to new inertial axes) and then rotating to a new, stable, temporary position before going back to the original state
