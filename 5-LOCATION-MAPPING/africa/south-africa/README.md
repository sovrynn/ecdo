# South Africa

Appears safe from deluge from S1 to S2.

## Southern Africa, Nobulart

Southern Africa, "The Cradle of Humankind" [1]. Seemingly has no cultural flood stories that I have found. Bears no evidence of marine inundation within the past 66 million years.[2] Has some of the longest continuously inhabited caves, some with habitation periods spanning tens of thousands of years, and going back 250ka.[3] The shallow (50-150m) Agulhas Bank and the (7500ft) Swartberg and (11,400ft) Drakensberg Mountains would present a bow-shaped aspect to the oncoming water during S2>S1, much like that of a ship, possibly diverting most of the flow. [4][5][6] The long NS striations along the western diamond coast of Namibia suggest large volumes of water may have washed up there, and that those famous stones weren't carried dozens of kilometers up the coast and inland from Oranjemund by any ordinary ocean current.[7] Red line is the ECDO displacement path.
