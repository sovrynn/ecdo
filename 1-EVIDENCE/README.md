# TODO: Creating a timeline

What can be used to create a timeline? There's actually quite a lot of data:
- Historical human chronology
- Date archaelogical sites of cities
- Paleomagnetic data
- Paleoclimatic data
- ice coring data
- historical water body data (ex black sea refillings)
- Biology (tree rings)
- Date dead plants and animals

There is a lot of historical material around 3200-2800 BC, and 2300-1700 BC, but 1400-1200 BC, 400 BC, and 500 AD may also be good periods to look into.
