## Antarctica Octogons

It is said that in Antarctica, there are multiple perfectly geometric 8-sided octagon structures discovered by ground penetrating radar near Beardmore Glacier. Engineers and scientists supposedly dug out the top layer of one octagon made of a pure black substance that was built on top of two more black octagonal structures that went down deep into the 2-mile-thick ice. Ground penetrating radar determined the structures to be an Octagon in shape and covering an area of over 60 acres.

It is believed that the structures were built by a human looking group of extraterrestrials, who were involved in the genetic engineering of humanity. Could this be an ancient extraterrestrial base used as a hub for global civilization? Jessica was tasked with this blind target and remote viewed these alleged structures, revealing her data here with researcher and experiencer Barry Littleton!

## Arctic Maps

The lands to the north are just as mysterious and guarded as the Antarctic. The maps today show nothing at the North Pole. Yet history depicts something much different not only lands but inhabited lands. Do you really think all these cartographers got it wrong?

## Underworld

Another notion I can't remove from my head is I want to be open and cautious not to fall into the trap of presentism.  Virtually all the ancient cultures: The Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Both the Greeks and Romans, Mesoamerican Cultures, Indigenous Cultures of North America, Eastern Cultures like Hindu... to name a few - all believed in the idea of an underworld.  It seems ubiquitous, why would they imagine such crazy idea?  Just makes me wonder...
