## Antarctica Octogons

It is said that in Antarctica, there are multiple perfectly geometric 8-sided octagon structures discovered by ground penetrating radar near Beardmore Glacier. Engineers and scientists supposedly dug out the top layer of one octagon made of a pure black substance that was built on top of two more black octagonal structures that went down deep into the 2-mile-thick ice. Ground penetrating radar determined the structures to be an Octagon in shape and covering an area of over 60 acres.

It is believed that the structures were built by a human looking group of extraterrestrials, who were involved in the genetic engineering of humanity. Could this be an ancient extraterrestrial base used as a hub for global civilization? Jessica was tasked with this blind target and remote viewed these alleged structures, revealing her data here with researcher and experiencer Barry Littleton!

## Arctic Maps

The lands to the north are just as mysterious and guarded as the Antarctic. The maps today show nothing at the North Pole. Yet history depicts something much different not only lands but inhabited lands. Do you really think all these cartographers got it wrong?

## Underworld

Another notion I can't remove from my head is I want to be open and cautious not to fall into the trap of presentism.  Virtually all the ancient cultures: The Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Both the Greeks and Romans, Mesoamerican Cultures, Indigenous Cultures of North America, Eastern Cultures like Hindu... to name a few - all believed in the idea of an underworld.  It seems ubiquitous, why would they imagine such crazy idea?  Just makes me wonder...

## The cryptoterrestrial hypothesis: A case for scientific openness to a concealed earthly explanation for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (hard copy here)

Came across this fascinating recent paper written by some Harvard professors discussing an alternative perspective on the usual alien narrative. It covers a few things discussed in this chat that many here might find of interest.

"Kastrup (2024) notes the viability of  the Silurian hypotheses, suggesting there has been “plenty of time and opportunity for other non-human species to have arisen on Earth, developed to a level of technology far beyond ours … and then to have effectively vanished due to one or more of the myriad possible civilisation-ending cataclysms.”"

## Atlanteans, Annunaki, Greek Gods = Us?

The Atlanteans, Anunnaki, Greek Gods = Us. 

We were reset 13,000 years ago. 

They were not. 

A breakaway portion escaped inside earth and continued developing. 

Thousands of years later when they emerged, they found a changed earth with primitive people. 

They helped them develop. 

They were seen as Gods or Sky People or ‘those that came from the Sea’ 

But they are Us. Just without the reset.
