## Antarctica Octogons

It is said that in Antarctica, there are multiple perfectly geometric 8-sided octagon structures discovered by ground penetrating radar near Beardmore Glacier. Engineers and scientists supposedly dug out the top layer of one octagon made of a pure black substance that was built on top of two more black octagonal structures that went down deep into the 2-mile-thick ice. Ground penetrating radar determined the structures to be an Octagon in shape and covering an area of over 60 acres.

It is believed that the structures were built by a human looking group of extraterrestrials, who were involved in the genetic engineering of humanity. Could this be an ancient extraterrestrial base used as a hub for global civilization? Jessica was tasked with this blind target and remote viewed these alleged structures, revealing her data here with researcher and experiencer Barry Littleton!

## Arctic Maps

The lands to the north are just as mysterious and guarded as the Antarctic. The maps today show nothing at the North Pole. Yet history depicts something much different not only lands but inhabited lands. Do you really think all these cartographers got it wrong?

## Underworld

Another notion I can't remove from my head is I want to be open and cautious not to fall into the trap of presentism.  Virtually all the ancient cultures: The Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Both the Greeks and Romans, Mesoamerican Cultures, Indigenous Cultures of North America, Eastern Cultures like Hindu... to name a few - all believed in the idea of an underworld.  It seems ubiquitous, why would they imagine such crazy idea?  Just makes me wonder...

"Tipping Point"
(feat. Thunder Bae)

I heard the latest news
Earth on collision course
Arches are build in vain
Here comes torrential rain

Facing the tidal wave
There is no time to waste
No riches worth saving
We're blinded by light
There's no place to hide

Tipping point
World out of joint
Tidal wave
Hoping for saving grace
Tipping point
Collision course
A deadly race
No time to waste.

"It doesn't really matter is the south turns north
Or the stars above stop their course
If then thousand coastal cities are taken by the wave, or not
The outcomes are still the same (for all of us now!)
Riddles in stone - great cycles of time
Forgotten, ignore - the ancient paradigm
A polarization of values happening
Opposing camps define themselves and pull apart

Night turns to day, darkness to light
A doorway opens to quantum sight
A world age shift, a converging sun
A field of energy reversal has begun
Suddenly it hit! - Pole shift

Now the pendulum has swung the other way
Pulling us out of our ingrained habits
The death of the old world
Slashing open the womb that held us all
So comfortably for so long
Calling on all of us to restore the biosphere
Towards a partnership of co-creation
In a relationship of resonance
Hand in hand we march into the unknown

Where the taboos of today are tomorrow's delights
Our values - inverted (so wrong it's right)
Sex morality imposition - all swept away
In one great orgasm - by the light of day
Suddenly it hit! - Pole shift

Communion with the stars - decode our DNA
Marvel at the mysteries of quantum immortality
Children of Elias - come!
Into a fifth world and a sixth sun
Yes, into a fifth world and a sixth sun
Suddenly it hit! - Pole shift"
