## Germany prepping?

Interestingly Germany's decision to get rid of its NPPs came after the Fukushima tsunami.

I just tried to back this up by searching the internet for two relatively recent quotes from high profile people about the risk of tsunamis and I cannot find them! One was a speech by the Sir Patrick Vallance in which he warned about the threat of tsunamis and the other was an Irish politician who stated Ireland needed to move its cities inland. I cannot find either quotes anywhere!

I asked about nuclear power generation across Europe, Russia and China. Interesting, confirming what I had heard from a few other sources in recent years. https://chatgpt.com/share/66ed403e-1fe8-8005-a945-4af4996028fa
