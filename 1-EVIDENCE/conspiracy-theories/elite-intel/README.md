## US Government

At one of the scientific meetings that Major White attended in the Pentagon in early 1948, the scientists discussed the advisability of alerting the public to the pending polar-flip phenomenon.

## US Gov Recent Paper

"The Earth’s core is undergoing a dramatic change with geomagnetic field strength dropping by 40% over the last 400 years, and satellite observations showing the field weakening ten times faster than previously calculated."

## Germany prepping?

Interestingly Germany's decision to get rid of its NPPs came after the Fukushima tsunami.

I just tried to back this up by searching the internet for two relatively recent quotes from high profile people about the risk of tsunamis and I cannot find them! One was a speech by the Sir Patrick Vallance in which he warned about the threat of tsunamis and the other was an Irish politician who stated Ireland needed to move its cities inland. I cannot find either quotes anywhere!

I asked about nuclear power generation across Europe, Russia and China. Interesting, confirming what I had heard from a few other sources in recent years. https://chatgpt.com/share/66ed403e-1fe8-8005-a945-4af4996028fa

## 7 of 9

Interesting choice of words for an AGW piece. In Masonic numerology, 7 of 9 may be interpreted as “completion of the divine”.

## "Major disruptive events" policy

Did you ever see this Sasha Latypova substack highlighting Air BnB's changes to its "Major Disruptive Events" policy? The date the changes are to be implemented is interesting 06/06/24. Bleedingly obvious to an "initiated eye" (6/6/6). Has this been put in place in time for your 1st disruption date of the opposing conjuction around the 16th June?
