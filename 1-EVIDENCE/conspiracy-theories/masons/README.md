"Freemasonry (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry) has a black-and-white checkerboard (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard) as a central symbol within the lodge and all rituals occur on or around this checkerboard.

The 7 stars are present in countless examples of masonic and hermetic art, along with the antediluvian pillars of Joachim and Boaz. Masonry has always presented the deluge as a focal tenet of both its philosophy and art. Text: https://t.co/oAnySAK7xC https://t.co/LTvB3H4XJG
