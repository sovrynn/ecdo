## Conspiracy theories

Could the accelerating trend of north pole wander in 2019 have prompted them to hit the button early on the plandemic? Jackson Hole and Event 201 were important events later in 2019 leading up to the launch of the psyop in 2020 (To impose totalitarian controls and depop the planet). Are their modern day Khafre surveillance technologies all flashing red?

## Behind schedule? [1]

I think its already overdue and we've been holding it back. It wasn't expected to be prevented for as long as it has, thus Agenda 21 became Agenda 2030 and the script for the control narrative seems to have disintegrated into some B grade horror movie which was scrawled on the back of a napkin.

## The Secret History of the World

"The Control System, via the offices of its high priests of science, ensures that glaciologists do not cross over into astrophysics and that geologists do not cross over into archaeology. In this way, there is no such thing as Comparative Science." - The Secret History of the World, Laura Knight-Jadczyk (2005)

## GPT sci-fi novel

17.8. had a discussion with ChatGPT v 4, of the idea for a "scifi- novel", I was blown away how many of the issues raised are already manifesting themselves.

In Finland "leaders" are preparing for a war. Related they have made it public that in the event of natural or man made emergency all the people will be evacuated to three areas.
