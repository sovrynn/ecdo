## Conspiracy theories

Could the accelerating trend of north pole wander in 2019 have prompted them to hit the button early on the plandemic? Jackson Hole and Event 201 were important events later in 2019 leading up to the launch of the psyop in 2020 (To impose totalitarian controls and depop the planet). Are their modern day Khafre surveillance technologies all flashing red?

## Behind schedule? [1]

I think its already overdue and we've been holding it back. It wasn't expected to be prevented for as long as it has, thus Agenda 21 became Agenda 2030 and the script for the control narrative seems to have disintegrated into some B grade horror movie which was scrawled on the back of a napkin.

## The Secret History of the World

"The Control System, via the offices of its high priests of science, ensures that glaciologists do not cross over into astrophysics and that geologists do not cross over into archaeology. In this way, there is no such thing as Comparative Science." - The Secret History of the World, Laura Knight-Jadczyk (2005)

## GPT sci-fi novel

17.8. had a discussion with ChatGPT v 4, of the idea for a "scifi- novel", I was blown away how many of the issues raised are already manifesting themselves. Sorry, the text is in Finnish, if somebody could translate it to more common language even with ai, it would probably be easier to read. (Hard copy `kielimallin M2 iltasatu.txt`)

## Finland war prep

In Finland "leaders" are preparing for a war. Related they have made it public that in the event of natural or man made emergency all the people will be evacuated to three areas. What I find peculiar is the similarity of the evacuation area to overlap with safe zone of envisioned deluge.It must be just another coincidence.

## Cometstrike Tabletop Exercise

I missed this report of a table top exercise that happened this summer.

What a curious thing to be looking into, I wonder what strikes them to do so... *sarcasm & pun intended*

What is this chart I wonder

Looking at the report: https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ttx5-quicklook-report-final.pdf?emrc=672d0a2c74dba

I wonder if it is trying to illustrate the impact corridor?

"Misinformation and disinformation would have to be dealt with." 

..."public messaging strategies"

"Congress unlikely to act unless
impact became certain"

"The most important item of the morning was
the discussion involving the political nature of
the decision making."

Basically in a real emergency they try not to panic the public.

## US Dollar decoupling

"The decoupling of the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971, known as the Nixon Shock, fundamentally transformed global monetary policy, enabling unprecedented flexibility in response to systemic challenges. Exploring this transition through the lens of historical evidence and current events, we can see how it allowed the U.S. and global economies to adapt to both economic and geophysical pressures, including potential geomagnetic influences." Excerpt from an interaction discussing USD, BTC, Bretton Woods and the geomagnetic excursion.

Decoupling the Limits to Growth (https://nobulart.com/decoupling-the-limits-to-growth/)
‚ÄúThe end of Bretton Woods allowed for an unprecedented ability to manage systemic shocks, including those potentially arising from geomagnetic and planetary cycles. While this connection remains speculative, the timing of the dollar‚Äôs decoupling and the NMDP‚Äôs acceleration suggests a deeper interrelation between human systems and Earth‚Äôs dynamic processes. Could this flexibility be a necessary adaptation for navigating a period of intensified geophysical upheaval?‚Äù

Here you go, somebody (or some agency) spent a lot of time putting this together.  There are a few different flavors of it.

## Tactical nukes

Last one https://x.com/cirnosad/status/1837698477100302667?s=19

Agree on that, not only observed in Lebanon but also Russia Tver attack impact is more aligned with tactical nukes than the official "drone debris", which is actually absurd as the reinforced ammunition bunkers totalled in large areas.

Some YT from Tver attack:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xxwgrcB4uI

The one that took place at toropets was a clear tactical nuke. You can see it from the column rising on pictures-followed by a Shroom. Characteristics of having an ionising column as opposed to a thermobaric which spreads in a non symmetrical way without the column

There are tactical nukes which fission at near 99% which does not spread radiation otherwise common in bigger older and strategic nukes. Lebanon port and toropets are show cases
