"In 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign . . . The Committee had the vaccine analyzed for hCG. Similarly laced tetanus vaccines were uncovered in the Philippines and Nicaragua. In addition to the WHO, other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccines using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities." - Vaccine Weekly (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12346214/) (1995)

## Bechamp or Pasteur

Ignore the patients that died after treatment, and claim that the 'therapy' works. Sound familiar? Only thing is, this scam started more than a hundred years ago.

## "Catastrophic Contagion"

"The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with WHO and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, conducted Catastrophic Contagion, a pandemic tabletop exercise at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on October 23, 2022.

The extraordinary group of participants consisted of 10 current and former Health Ministers and senior public health officials from Senegal, Rwanda, Nigeria, Angola, Liberia, Singapore, India, Germany, as well as Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The exercise simulated a series of WHO emergency health advisory board meetings addressing a fictional pandemic set in the near future. Participants grappled with how to respond to an epidemic located in one part of the world that then spread rapidly, becoming a pandemic with a higher fatality rate than COVID-19 and disproportionately affecting children and young people.

Participants were challenged to make urgent policy decisions with limited information in the face of uncertainty. Each problem and choice had serious health, economic, and social ramifications. "
