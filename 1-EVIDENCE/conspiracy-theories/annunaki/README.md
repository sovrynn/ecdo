# Annunaki

## Origin - Orion?

Not just the Giza pyramids, most of the ancient sites are oriented to Orion. Orion is where the Annunaki supposedly come from. Considering they brought us civilisation and science it makes sense that all the tech they helped us build would pay homage to their home star.
