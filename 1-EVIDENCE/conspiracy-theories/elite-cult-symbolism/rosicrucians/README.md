## Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians

"The Rosicrucians teach that these seven planets of our planetary chain are closely linked and connected by subtle etheric forces, and that there is a constant etheric current passing from one to the others and flowing ever through the entire circuit." - Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians, W.W Atkinson (1918)
