"Freemasonry (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry) has a black-and-white checkerboard (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkerboard) as a central symbol within the lodge and all rituals occur on or around this checkerboard. Also known as a Mosaic Pavement, it represents the floor of King Solomon's Temple and according to Shakespeare (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare), represents man's natural duality."

The secret societies play both sides of the coin. White" hat roles" vs "black hat". Luciferian vs Satanism. Each side creates their own straw man to achieve their own objectives. Hegalian Dialectic. This is how you move and compel the masses.

This idea goes all the way back to nimrod and his religion and guarded by the secret societies. Martin is just signaling that he is playing his role. He is part of the team... they all are.
