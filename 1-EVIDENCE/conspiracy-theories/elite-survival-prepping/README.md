Evidence of elites preparing for... something.

## Billionaires preparing for apocalypse

"A rising number of American billionaires are channeling their inner Bear Grylls — some in preparation for an apocalyptic event, be it a viral epidemic, nuclear war, or cataclysmic pole shift. Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of LinkedIn and a notable investor, told The New Yorker earlier this year he estimated that more than 50% of Silicon Valley billionaires had bought some level of "apocalypse insurance," like an underground bunker." - Business Insider

"The Billion Year Archive™ is an Arch Mission Foundation initiative that seeks to build a solar-system scale archive of human civilization that will last for at least billions of years. The Billion Year Archive is the largest footprint and longest duration engineering project in human history. It is also the first practical initiative with potential to guarantee that our species and civilization will never be lost. The more locations that Arch Libraries that are sent to, the greater the probability that at least some of them will survive to be discovered in the distant future. Long after the Pyramids have turned to dust, and no matter what transpires on Earth, The Billion Year Archive will remain. The Billion Year Archive is comprised of ultra long-term storage devices called Arch™ Libraries (pronounced ”Arks”)."

"The first installment of data was encoded by Dr. Peter Kazansky and team, at the University of Southampton Optoelectronics Centre, to 5D optical data storage media, in quartz silica glass, with a durability of 14 billion years, inside a specially constructed metallic container and stored inside a vault within a deep underground cave. 

It is important to note that the initial sets of knowledge can be recovered with a microscope - and do not require advanced technology such as computers or lasers. We will include additional microscope-accessible  knowledge that teaches everything necessary to retrieve digital data that will be included in the future as well."

Arch Mission Chairman Nova Spivack invited The Sun to see the first “Earth disk” being installed at the Hagerbach Test Gallery - a massive research and development facility hidden beneath a mountain... "We are overdue a geological cataclysm, not to mention cosmic energy bursts, and all the risks that humans themselves are causing - nuclear war, bio apocalypse, etc."
