# Date Anomalies

Dating anomalies and calendar shifts.

## Heat's effect on Carbon-14 dating

*"Effects of fires and biofractionation of carbon isotopes on results of radiocarbon dating of old textiles:"*

*"This carboxylation process involves carbon-containing combustion gases, CO and CO2, in the presence of silver cations, water and heat. As a result, a significant additional amount of14C and13C atoms incorporate into the textile cellulose structure as a portion of carboxy-groups."*

Extra carbon-14 would make the carbon dating give a more recent date than the actual older date. It's possible that the energy from the Sun could significantly change the amount of carbon in the organic material.

## 687 BC Calendar Shift

We also have to look at the calendar shift from 360 to 365 days after 687BC. This is likely contributing cause to confusion and error when investigating and dating events before that time.
