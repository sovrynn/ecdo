# Human Built ECDO-related Structures

This folder is for important structures humans have built that are potentially related to ECDO events.

Khafre Pyramid, a structure that is central to the ECDO thesis, is in `khafre`.

## Babylon

*"The walls of the mighty Babylon and the eight-volved Tower of Babel or cloud-encompassed Bel were never constructed to resist any mortal foe. NO. Those city walls, which were 60 miles in circumference, 200 feet high, 578 feet thick, were not made to defy the strength of armies, but to resist the fearful forces of Nature, the floods that swept the plains of Shinar, from the mountains of Armenia, every spring during this Age of Horror. The tremendous embankments and river walls constructed by the Ancients are monuments of human skill and enterprise belonging to an epoch that antedates by thousands of years the Age of their supposed builders."* - Thomas H. Burgoyne, The Light of Egypt - Vol. I (1889)

*"This accounts for and fully explains the existence of fossil remains of the seal, walrus and polar bear in the burning plains of Africa and Hindustan, and of the tropical remains now being discovered in the Arctic regions."*

This would very likely have been expunged from recent records. His source would predate 1889.

## Gobekli Tepe [1]

Confirming TES' speculated built date in the period after the YDB. I'm thinking Gobleke Tepe was built during the previous stable period. So there was an event that triggered the constuction of GT as an observatory, which is starting to make it look as though the 'YDB Event' might more properly be called the BAI Event.

My thinking is that it was built to watch for whatever we encountered around 12,800 BC that upset the apple cart. It's possible that the focus on interpreting GT should be expanded to include consideration of the stars at that earlier time. It would have possibly been more likely to have been built during the warmer insterstadia than the cooler YD.

## Gobekli Tepe's relation to comets

An interesting paper, with a convincing argument that GT was astronomically linked to observing (predicting?) the progenitor of Encke and the taurids in much the same way as the pyramids were constructed to monitor the aftermath of the YDB event.

## Great Circle Artifacts

![great circle artifacts](img/great-circle-artifacts.jpg "great circle artifacts")

Angkor Wat and Nazca lie on the great circle centred at Stonehenge (red trace). Another great circle connects Easter Island, Machu Picchu, Giza and Mohenjo-daro (blue trace). Intersections at Peru and Cambodia may account for the high density of megaliths, geoglyphs and curious artefacts found there. The planes defined by these great circles intersect along an axis approximately connecting Angkor Wat to Nazca/Paracas, inclined to one another at sin âˆ’1 (0.9) the gradian/degree ratio being 9/10.

Curious on the difference between 1700 BC and 1300-1200 BC dating for some of these events.
