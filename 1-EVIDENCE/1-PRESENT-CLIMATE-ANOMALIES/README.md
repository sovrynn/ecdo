# Recent Climate Anomalies

TLDR - rainfall, storms, earthquakes, auroras, volcanoes.

## Ethical Skeptic

The [first part](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2020/02/16/the-climate-change-alternative-we-ignore-to-our-peril/) of Ethical Skeptic's three-part ECDO thesis is one of the best sources that the climate has been changing recently. I will take some quotes that summarize his points:
- *"Atmospheric CO2 levels follow temperature rises and are accelerating â€“ Manâ€™s carbon-producing activity is linear and of insufficient slope to drive this"*
- *"48% of global ocean sea surface temperature heat content rise from 1995 to 2023 arrived in a mere 3 to 4 weeks of 2023, far too fast for the atmosphere or man to serve as the cause. A record level Antarctic ice melt-off occurred simultaneously to this and during a record cold winter"*
- *"Abyssal and deep oceans at sea bottom are absorbing excessive novel heat content per cubic kilometer of ocean"*

# TODO

Adding to TES's thesis part 1:
- North pole movement
- schumann resonance; magnetic pole strength weakening
- rainfall increase
- more auroras
- murders (due to lower magnetic field)
