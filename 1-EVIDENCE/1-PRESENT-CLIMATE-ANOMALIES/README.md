# Recent Climate Anomalies

TLDR - rainfall, storms, earthquakes, auroras, volcanoes.

## Ethical Skeptic

The [first part](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2020/02/16/the-climate-change-alternative-we-ignore-to-our-peril/) of Ethical Skeptic's three-part ECDO thesis is one of the best sources that the climate has been changing recently. I will take some quotes that summarize his points:
- *"Atmospheric CO2 levels follow temperature rises and are accelerating – Man’s carbon-producing activity is linear and of insufficient slope to drive this"*
- *"48% of global ocean sea surface temperature heat content rise from 1995 to 2023 arrived in a mere 3 to 4 weeks of 2023, far too fast for the atmosphere or man to serve as the cause. A record level Antarctic ice melt-off occurred simultaneously to this and during a record cold winter"*
- *"Abyssal and deep oceans at sea bottom are absorbing excessive novel heat content per cubic kilometer of ocean"*

## Flooding

Even the collector of this material is so astounded by the volume of water seen in September that he’s compiled it into a thread.

## Rainfall data fudging [1]

Where did all the water go? Further examples of altered rainfall data from 16 different cities around the world. Unusually high rainfall records for the past three years have been erased from the record.

## Nepal half-century of "most intense rainfall"

## Meteor strike fudging

Did you know there was a meteorite strike on march 28, 2020 that struck Nigeria and left an uncomfortable crater? Did you also know we had another extremely near miss of an asteroid on November 12 of the same year? No one reported them.

The 2 ships that were moored on ny harbor supposedy for Covid were actually floating hospitals designed for trauma patients (as in those who would be victims of a traumatic event-asteroid strike) and not for infectious disease treatment. Not a single Covid patient was treated onboard either of them. Uncanny don’t you think?

UK built a load of temporary hospitals too. Called Nightingale hospitals. Never had a patient.
