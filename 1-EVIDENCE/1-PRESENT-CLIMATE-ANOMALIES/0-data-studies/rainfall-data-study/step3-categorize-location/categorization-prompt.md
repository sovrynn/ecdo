What follows is a list of locations, potentially cities, areas, etc. I want you to create a categorization based on countries/continents of where those cities are located. For example if you get a list of cities "New York, San Francisco, Miami" you should return a categorization "USA". If you get a list of cities not together, for example "San Francisco, Dubai" you should return "USA, Middle East" or something similar, so that it covers all the input cities. DO NOT PUT DUPLICATE LOCATIONS IN THE RESULT. Most countries should be combined into continents where reasonable, such as multiple USA states or multiple EUropean mainland countries. Here's the list of locations:
