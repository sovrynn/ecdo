The documentation is terrible. Who did this work?!?!?!

If you look at the script folder names (stepX) you can see some of what I was doing.

Obviously I didn't upload the global data.

But then I did a "reduction" where I only kept data matching certain filters. Oh what happened is I reduced the data to yearly, and removed certain columns.

Then I did a "longtrim" where I further filtered the data down.
