Step-by-Step Approach to Calculate the SAA Surface Area from gufm1 and IGRF:

1. Obtain the Geomagnetic Field Model Data:  
   - gufm1 model: Provides historical spherical harmonic coefficients of Earth’s main magnetic field, typically spanning roughly 1590 to 1990.
   - IGRF model: The International Geomagnetic Reference Field provides standard sets of spherical harmonic coefficients updated every five years from 1900 to the present.

2. Compute the Magnetic Field Intensity Over a Grid:
   - Set altitude and grid resolution: Decide at what altitude (usually Earth’s surface at radius ~6371.2 km) and what latitude-longitude resolution (e.g., 1° x 1°) you will use.
   - Evaluate field from coefficients: Using the Gauss coefficients \((g_n^m, h_n^m)\) of the chosen model, compute the scalar magnetic field intensity \(B = \sqrt{B_r^2 + B_\theta^2 + B_\phi^2}\) at each grid point.  
     The magnetic potential \(V(r,\theta,\phi)\) is given by:
     \[
     V(r,\theta,\phi) = a \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^{n+1} \sum_{m=0}^{n} \bigl(g_n^m \cos(m\phi) + h_n^m \sin(m\phi)\bigr) P_n^m(\cos\theta)
     \]
     From \(V\), derive \(B_r, B_\theta, B_\phi\).

3. Define a Threshold for the SAA:
   - The SAA is typically defined where the total field intensity is abnormally low. A commonly used threshold is around 22,000 nT at Earth’s surface.
   - Identify all points where \(B <\) threshold. These points form the SAA region for that epoch.

4. Calculate the Surface Area:
   - Each grid cell has an area on the spherical surface:
     \[
     \Delta \text{Area} \approx R^2 \sin(\theta) \Delta \theta \Delta \phi
     \]
     where \(R\) is Earth’s radius, \(\theta\) is colatitude, and \(\Delta \theta, \Delta \phi\) are the cell’s angular size in radians.
   - Sum the areas of all cells falling under the SAA intensity threshold to get the total SAA area.

5. Repeat for Different Epochs or Models:
   - For historical changes, repeat using gufm1 data at various time steps.
   - For recent periods, use IGRF models and track how the SAA extent evolves over time.

6. Consider Sensitivities:
   - The chosen threshold intensity affects the resulting area.
   - Grid resolution and maximum spherical harmonic degree used also influence accuracy.
   - Compare results with published studies or other models for validation.

This approach allows you to quantify how the SAA’s spatial extent changes over time using geomagnetic field models like gufm1 for historical data and IGRF for more recent epochs.
