## Can Voight's Law Be Fitted to a Partial Timeseries?

### Short Answer:
Yes, you can model a partial timeseries with Voight’s law, but the reliability and stability of the model parameters (including the critical time \( t_c \)) may be significantly reduced. The shorter the data coverage and the further it is from the tipping point, the greater the uncertainty in the results.

### Considerations When Modeling Partial Timeseries:

1. **Data Proximity to the Critical Time**:
   - Voight’s law is most effective when the data captures the system’s acceleration as it approaches the tipping point.
   - If the partial timeseries (e.g., 1900–2025) does not include a significant portion of this accelerating trend, the estimated parameters (e.g., \( t_c \)) will be highly uncertain.
   - The further the data is from the critical time, the weaker the signal for the model to capture.

2. **Length of the Timeseries**:
   - A short data segment relative to the total evolution of the system (e.g., modeling 1900–2025 when the process spans 0–2000) may not provide enough information to fit all parameters reliably.
   - A limited timespan increases the likelihood of unstable or divergent fits.

3. **Parameter Stability and Uncertainty**:
   - Voight’s law has multiple parameters (e.g., \( a, \alpha, A, B, p \)) that must be fitted. Without sufficient data spanning the acceleration phase, the fitting problem becomes underdetermined.
   - This can lead to:
     - Wide error bounds on parameter estimates.
     - Multiple potential fits with significantly different \( t_c \).

4. **Practical Approaches**:
   - **Use Available Data**:
     - Fit the model to your data (e.g., 1900–2025). While preliminary, this may provide insights into whether the system exhibits signs of acceleration.
   - **Estimate Uncertainty**:
     - Perform rigorous uncertainty analysis (e.g., bootstrapping, Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to quantify how sensitive the results are to the limited data.
   - **Incorporate External Knowledge**:
     - If additional historical data, theoretical insights, or prior estimates are available, include these as constraints to stabilize the fit.
   - **Revisit the Model Over Time**:
     - As new data is collected closer to the critical point, the model can be updated and refined to improve predictions.

### Key Challenges:
- **Instability of \( t_c \)**:
  - Predictions of \( t_c \) (critical time) may vary dramatically when additional data is added.
- **Wide Parameter Ranges**:
  - Limited data may lead to poor constraints on the parameters, such as \( \alpha \), \( p \), or \( B \).

---

### Conclusion:
It is possible to apply Voight’s law to a partial timeseries, but the predictive power and confidence in the results depend on how much of the accelerating trend is captured. The method becomes more reliable as the data includes more of the system's behavior closer to the tipping point.
