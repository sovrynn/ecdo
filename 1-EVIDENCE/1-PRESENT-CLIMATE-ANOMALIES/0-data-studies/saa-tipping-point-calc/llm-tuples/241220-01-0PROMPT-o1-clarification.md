So, clarify a few things for me:

1. How do you know you can interpolate the values of 5 year granularity to achieve anything in between? Is this part of the mathematical equation? Is this mentioned explicitly in IGRF-14 docs?
2. WHat kind of mathematical equation is even used for these "gauss" coefficients? Explain its base form to me in a simple way.
