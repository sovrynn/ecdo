In principle, both **gufm1** and **IGRF** are expressed in terms of **spherical harmonics**, which tend to be fairly smooth at the spatial resolutions they represent (up to the maximum degree/order of the model). You should not expect random “pixel-to-pixel” noise spikes like you might see in raw, unprocessed measurement data. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Spherical Harmonic Smoothness**  
   - Because the field is described by a finite sum of spherical harmonic coefficients (e.g., degree 13 for IGRF and up to degree 14 for gufm1), the resulting field is smooth on scales below which the model has no power. So large gradients in total field strength \(F\) usually appear only where they are physically expected, not as random noise.

2. **Resolution & Grid Spacing**  
   - If your latitude–longitude grid is coarse (e.g., 1° or 2°), you might not see tiny “spikes” because the spherical harmonic model is already somewhat low-resolution. If you do use very fine grids (e.g., 0.1° steps), you may see small variations, but they are still not “noise” in the typical sense. They’re just the smooth changes dictated by the spherical harmonic functions.

3. **Threshold Boundaries**  
   - Even with a smooth function, the 32,000 nT isoline can sometimes snake around in ways that produce multiple “contours” or small disconnected patches. This is not necessarily noise; it’s just the geometry of the field. It can look wiggly, especially over time, but that generally doesn’t create truly spurious pockets.
   - If you’re seeing *extremely narrow or single-grid-cell “gaps”* that break what would otherwise be a contiguous region, you could apply a small morphological filter (e.g., a dilation–erosion) or a cluster analysis that merges small, adjacent patches. This ensures that tiny slivers in the data don’t fragment the region artificially.

4. **Practical Flood Fill / Clustering**  
   - In practice, most people use a clustering algorithm (2D connected-component labeling) rather than a pure flood-fill from a single seed point. If there are very thin “lines” of slightly higher \(F\) values within a predominantly low-\(F\) region, you can handle that by simply choosing the *largest* cluster below the threshold or by allowing a small “tolerance” for bridging tiny gaps.
   - If, for instance, you get two labeled patches that are extremely close or separated by a line only 1 or 2 grid cells wide, you can merge them if you have reason to believe they’re physically part of the same region.

5. **Don’t Confuse Real Field Variations with Noise**  
   - The historical field in gufm1 can have moderate gradients, especially near the boundaries of the anomalous zone, but it’s not truly “noisy.” If you do see small spatiotemporal fluctuations (like the SAA “splitting” into two lobes, which has been noted in recent decades), that’s real structure in the field, not model noise.

**Bottom Line:**  
- Gufm1 and IGRF typically **do not** exhibit random, high-frequency noise. They can, however, produce slightly wiggly contours for a given threshold.  
- A basic flood fill or threshold-based clustering will almost always work fine, but if you’re worried about narrow, artificial “gaps,” you can do a small morphological close/open or merge neighboring clusters in post-processing.  
- The key is to recognize that subtle features in the field might cause you to see multiple patches if you’re *strictly* thresholding at 32,000 nT. This is less about noise and more about where the field actually crosses that isoline.
