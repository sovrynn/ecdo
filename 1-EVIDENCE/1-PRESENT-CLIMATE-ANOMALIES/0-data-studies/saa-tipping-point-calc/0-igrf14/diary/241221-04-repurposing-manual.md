So what's going to happen?

I'm going to manually edit the entry script for the simplest case. That's all that will be necessary. It will be very very simple.

# What do I need

I need a function that takes inputs and returns an output field value.

That's all. And test it.

# More details

I want to be able to just input a few things, and get a number

lat/lon, date. That's it!
