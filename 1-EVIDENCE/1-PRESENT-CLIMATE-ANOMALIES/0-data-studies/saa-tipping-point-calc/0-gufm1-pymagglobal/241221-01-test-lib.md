Read this documentation of a python library pymagglobal that maps many different geomagnetic models. I've installed it using pip in a venv. Write a short little test script that takes the lat/lon (-15, -60) and prints out the nt values at 5 year intervals from 1900 to 1990, using the gufm1 model:

Package Documentation
python interface for global geomagnetic field models (pymagglobal)

pymagglobal serves the purpose of replacing some Fortran scripts, which are used in the geomagnetism community to evaluate global field models. It can be applied to all cubic-spline based geomagnetic field models stored in the same file format as gufm1 or the CALSxk model series.

The package exposes several methods that can be applied to models or splines representing a model. To acces the models, use the Model class or its attribute Model.splines. With the models dictionary, several built-in models can be accessed, see also the list of included models.

    Parameters:

            name (str) – The name of the model. If fname is none, the built-in model will be used.

            fname (str, optional) – The path leading to a model file in the format of gufm1 and the CALSxk- series.

    t_min, t_max[source]

        The lower and upper bounds for the model time series. Above and below these the time series will be extrapolated and not robust.

        The maximal spherical harmonics degree included in the model.

        Type:

    Evaluate splines at an epoch and return the coefficients at the Earth’s surface, together with the appropriate degrees and orders. If coefficients at level different from the Earth’s surface are required, use utils.scaling to get the respective scaling factors.

    Parameters:

pymagglobal.utils.dsh_basis(lmax, z, out=None, R=6371.2)[source]

    Write the magnetic field basis functions, evaluated at points z, into the array out. These are basically the derivatives of the spherical harmonics in spherical coordinates with some scaling factors applied. Note that it is assumed that the coefficients that are multiplied to this basis are given at the radius R. This implementation is based on a specific recursion of the Legendre polynomials, to guarantee sane behavior at the poles. See [Du] for further details.

    Parameters:

            lmax (int) – The maximal spherical harmonics degree.

            z (array of shape (3, n)) –

            The points at which to evaluate the basis functions, given as

                    z[0, :] contains the colatitude in degrees.

                    z[1, :] contains the longitude in degrees.

                    z[2, :] contains the radius in kilometers.

            out (array of shape (lmax2N(lmax), 3*n), optional) – The output array in which the basis functions are to be stored. This is included for historic reasons. Originally the function was to be replacable by a C-based function from the related pyfield library at a later stage [FieldTools].

            R (float, optional) – The reference radius for the coefficients.

    Returns:

        out –

        Array in which the basis functions are stored, as follows:

                out[i, 0::3] contains the North component of the basis

                    corresponding to degree l and order m, where i = lm2i(l, m).

                out[i, 1::3] contains the East component of the basis.

                out[i, 2::3] contains the Down component of the basis.

    Return type:

        array of shape (lmax2N(lmax), 3*n)
