# North Pole Wander Measurement Verification

## British Geological Survey [2]

"The British Geological Survey is a partly publicly funded body which aims to advance geoscientific knowledge of the United Kingdom landmass and its continental shelf by means of systematic surveying, monitoring and research. The BGS headquarters are in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, England."

### The Great North Run [3]

The British Geological Survey seems to verify that Earth's magnetic field is undergoing changes:

"The 2021 revision of the model predicts that the direction of magnetic north will be the same as the direction of true north and grid north at the Isle of Purbeck/Poole in Dorset in November/December 2022. The point of coincidence of these three norths will then itself move northwards, passing Skipton in North Yorkshire in first half of 2024 and expected to reach Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire some time in 2026. These later predictions will need refining nearer the time to account for any sudden and poorly understood changes in the magnetic field known as jerks or impulses."

## NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information)

"The National Centers for Environmental Information is a U.S. government agency that manages one of the world's largest archives of atmospheric, coastal, geophysical, and oceanic data. The current director is Derek Arndt."

### Wandering of the Geomagnetic Poles [4]

"It has been long understood that dip poles migrate over time. In 1831, James Clark Ross located the north dip pole position in northern Canada. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) tracked the North Magnetic Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to reestablish the Pole's location from 1948 to 1994. An international collaboration, led by a French fundraising association, Poly-Arctique, and involving NRCan, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere, added two locations of the North Magnetic Pole in 2001 and 2007. The most recent survey determined that the Pole is moving approximately north-northwest at 55km per year."

## How can we trust the data?

If they were fudging the data, GPS systems and dependent services such as planes wouldn't work. These systems are used worldwide.

Also, if they really wanted to hide it, they would make more of an effort to censor the data from the public space, such as from being published by public institutions.

What follows is an understanding of what would break if the north magnetic pole data was fudged.

### GPT: Planes and Navigation Systems: Is There a Physical Dependency on Magnetic North?

In **modern aviation**, the **physical dependency on the Earth's magnetic field** has diminished due to advancements in technology, especially with the widespread use of **GPS** and **inertial navigation systems (INS)**. Here’s how this plays out:

1. **GPS and INS**: These systems **don’t depend on magnetic north** in a physical sense. GPS provides **positional data** using satellite signals, while INS tracks the plane's movement through accelerometers and gyroscopes. Both of these systems are independent of the Earth’s magnetic field.

2. **Magnetic Heading as a Convention**: When aviation uses "magnetic heading," it’s more of a **convention** than a physical requirement. Historically, magnetic compasses were the most reliable tool for navigation, so magnetic headings became the **standard reference** for navigation and air traffic control. Today, that convention persists even though modern systems could theoretically use any fixed reference, such as **true north** (geographic north) or even **geomagnetic north** (the more stable, globally averaged magnetic field).

3. **Could We Use Geomagnetic North?**
   - Yes, in theory, planes could use **geomagnetic north** or even **true north** as a reference instead of **magnetic north**.
   - In fact, some advanced systems and regions (like those near the poles) already do use true north in place of magnetic north because the magnetic poles shift over time.
   - The important factor for navigation is that there’s a **consistent, reliable anchor point** for directional headings.

### Why Still Use Magnetic North?

The continued use of magnetic north isn’t because there’s an engineering requirement for it, but because:
- **Legacy Systems and Standardization**: The **aviation infrastructure** (air traffic control, runway numbers, etc.) has long been based on magnetic headings. Shifting to a different reference, like true north, would require global recalibration, and as long as magnetic north remains a functional reference, there’s little incentive to change.
  
- **Regional Variations**: Magnetic north shifts over time (the magnetic poles wander), but **magnetic declination** (the difference between magnetic north and true north) is well known and can be adjusted for. Modern systems account for these variations dynamically. The magnetic heading reference can thus remain consistent enough for operational purposes.

- **Redundancy**: Magnetic compasses still provide a **failsafe** method of navigation, especially when electronic systems fail. Compasses are simple, passive instruments that don't depend on satellites or power sources, making them reliable in emergencies.

### Geomagnetic North as a Replacement?

Yes, **geomagnetic north** could technically replace **magnetic north** for many systems, because it is a stable, calculated reference point based on the Earth’s magnetic field as a whole, rather than the physically shifting magnetic poles.

In fact, as you noted:
- The **dependency isn’t on the Earth's local magnetic field itself**, but rather on having a fixed, agreed-upon reference for heading and orientation.
- Systems like **GPS and INS** don’t rely on magnetic fields at all for position or movement tracking; they only use magnetic north as a **calibration point** to align with historical aviation conventions.

### Key Point: No True Physical Dependency on Magnetic North

You're right in concluding that there’s **no deep physical dependency** on the actual magnetic field. Planes don’t need the actual magnetic north pole itself; they need a **consistent and well-understood directional reference**. If the industry decided to switch to **true north** or **geomagnetic north**, they could—although it would require recalibrating a lot of legacy infrastructure.

### In Summary:
- **Planes don’t need magnetic north** in a physical sense, just a consistent reference point for navigation.
- Magnetic north is still used out of **historical convention** and ease of use, but it’s not essential in a technical or physical sense.
- Systems like **GPS and INS** don’t require any reference to the Earth’s magnetic field, they only cross-reference it for alignment with air traffic control instructions or legacy systems.
- If needed, **true north** or **geomagnetic north** could replace magnetic north without major engineering issues, but it would require a global overhaul of navigation standards.

So, while magnetic north remains the reference point for a lot of navigation, it's more of a **convention** than a necessity.
