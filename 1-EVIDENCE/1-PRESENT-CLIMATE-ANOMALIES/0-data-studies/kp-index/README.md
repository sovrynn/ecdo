# Kp-index

"The K-index quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field with an integer in the range 0â€“9 with 1 being calm and 5 or more indicating a geomagnetic storm. It is derived from the maximum fluctuations of horizontal components observed on a magnetometer during a three-hour interval."

"The Kp index (where "p" stands for "planetary") is a global index of geomagnetic activity. It is calculated by averaging the K indices from a network of geomagnetic observatories around the world, providing a more comprehensive, planet-wide measure of geomagnetic disturbance."

## Ap vs Kp

"The Ap index does not have additional inputs beyond Kp values, but it applies a linear scaling transformation to Kp values to better represent the actual geomagnetic activity intensity. "

### More detail

The K-index is quasi-logarithmic local index of the 3-hourly range in magnetic activity relative to an assumed quiet-day curve for a single geomagnetic observatory site. First introduced by J. Bartels in 1938, it consists of a single-digit 0 thru 9 for each 3-hour interval of the universal time day (UT).

The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern geomagnetic latitude. The scale is O to 9 expressed in thirds of a unit, e.g. 5- is 4 2/3, 5 is 5 and 5+ is 5 1/3. This planetary index is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its magnetic effects. The 3-hourly ap (equivalent range) index is derived from the Kp index as follows:

Kp = 0o   0+   1-   1o   1+   2-   2o   2+   3-   3o   3+   4-   4o   4+

ap =  0    2    3    4    5    6    7    9   12   15   18   22   27   32

Kp = 5-   5o   5+   6-   6o   6+   7-   7o   7+   8-   8o   8+   9-   9o

ap = 39   48   56   67   80   94  111  132  154  179  207  236  300  400

# Method

I'll use Ap for now (Kp is 1-9 log scale, Ap is linear 0-400, more granularity). Obviously it shouldn't really matter. But Ap values are already sitting there on daily granularity nicely for me.

`sampler-viz.py`, tested to correctly parse the values, average, and perform a linear regression on them, on local manufactured test cases.

# Quiet and Disturbed Days

Just seems like a less absolute and granular way of measuring the Kp/Ap, at least for the intents of this study.

## Format

The International Quiet and Disturbed Days are determined from the Kp values of the respective
month based on a combination of criteria like the sum of the Kp values for a day, the sum of their
squares, and the maximum Kp. The 10 quiet days are selected and ordered, with the quietest day 
being labelled Q1 and the least quiet day of these 10 days being labelled Q10.

Any of these days 
can be assigned the letter A if Ap exceeds 6 for this day or the letter K if Ap is smaller or equal 
6, but one Kp value exceeds 3, or two Kp values exceed 2+.

The 5 disturbed days are selected and 
ordered from D1 (the most disturbed day)

to D5. An asterisk (*) is assigned to a disturbed day if 
Ap is smaller 20.

The Kp index was introduced by Bartels (1949) and is produced by Geomagnetic
Observatory Niemegk, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences.
