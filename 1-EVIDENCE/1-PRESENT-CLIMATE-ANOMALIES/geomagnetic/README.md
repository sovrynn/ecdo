## NOAA December 2023 State of the Geomagnetic Field (hard copy here)

The WMM (World Magnetic Model) gets updated once every 5 years, with the last time being in 2020. More up-to-date data is not easily found.

However, NOAA has [published a report in December 2023](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/g/files/anmtlf171/files/2023-12/WMM_Annual_Report_2023.pdf) called "State of the Geomagnetic Field" with some analysis on the current state of the geomagnetic field. Following is a quote from the paper:

*"This suggests that nonlinear changes in the Earth’s magnetic field have remained small over the past three years. Since 2020, the north magnetic dip pole has moved at an average speed of 41 km/yr, and the south magnetic dip pole at 9 km/yr. Neither underwent any noticeable change in direction."*

## State of the geomagnetic field [1]

NOAA have not updated the publicly available magnetic pole data [1] since 2020. The December 2023 State of the Geomagnetic Field report [2] does, however, contain some clues as to how things are progressing: "Since 2020, the north magnetic dip pole has moved at an average speed of 41 km/yr [~36.8° per century], and the south magnetic dip pole at 9 km/yr  [~8.1° per century]. Neither underwent any noticeable change in direction. /// The South Atlantic Anomaly, where the geomagnetic field intensity is lowest, has continued to deepen (by about 25 nT at surface level) and move westward (its center moved by about 20 km at surface level) in the past year. /// In the SAA the intensity of the field is about one-third of that near the magnetic poles." By this account, the current geomagnetic excursion continues unabated.

## St. Elmo's Fire, Blue Jets and Red Sprites are indicative of ground-ionosphere field reversals. Visible evidence of the ongoing geomagnetic excursion.
