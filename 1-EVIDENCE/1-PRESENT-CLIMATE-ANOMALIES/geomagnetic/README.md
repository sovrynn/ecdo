## Recent Schumann Resonance band changes; Weaknening of the Earth's magnetic moment

[Ethical Skeptic's thesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2020/02/16/the-climate-change-alternative-we-ignore-to-our-peril/) covers these recent geomagnetic changes in depth.

*"Recent Schumann Resonance banding-power (not the frequencies themselves as has been errantly reported by some sources) has ranged upwards through more of the higher frequencies inside the established eight resonance harmonics (six of which manifest in the Exhibit 5A example to the right); indicating a weakening in the Earth’s magnetic moment generated from its solid core."*

He provides plenty of sources, I encourage you to look at his original work.

## NOAA December 2023 State of the Geomagnetic Field (hard copy here)

The WMM (World Magnetic Model) gets updated once every 5 years, with the last time being in 2020. More up-to-date data is not easily found.

However, NOAA has [published a report in December 2023](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/g/files/anmtlf171/files/2023-12/WMM_Annual_Report_2023.pdf) called "State of the Geomagnetic Field" with some analysis on the current state of the geomagnetic field. Following is a quote from the paper:

*"This suggests that nonlinear changes in the Earth’s magnetic field have remained small over the past three years. Since 2020, the north magnetic dip pole has moved at an average speed of 41 km/yr, and the south magnetic dip pole at 9 km/yr. Neither underwent any noticeable change in direction."*
