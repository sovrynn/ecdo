## Recent Schumann Resonance band changes; Weaknening of the Earth's magnetic moment

[Ethical Skeptic's thesis](https://theethicalskeptic.com/2020/02/16/the-climate-change-alternative-we-ignore-to-our-peril/) covers these recent geomagnetic changes in depth.

*"Recent Schumann Resonance banding-power (not the frequencies themselves as has been errantly reported by some sources) has ranged upwards through more of the higher frequencies inside the established eight resonance harmonics (six of which manifest in the Exhibit 5A example to the right); indicating a weakening in the Earth’s magnetic moment generated from its solid core."*

He provides plenty of sources, I encourage you to look at his original work.

## Decrease of Schumann resonance frequencies and changes in the effective lightning areas toward the solar cycle minimum of 2008–2009 (hard copy here)

### GPT: Summary of Research on Schumann Resonances and Solar Cycle Minimum (2008-2009)

This study investigates changes in Schumann resonance (SR) frequencies during the solar cycle minimum of 2008-2009. The research highlights several key findings regarding SR behavior in response to variations in solar activity:

1. **Decrease in SR Frequencies**: Observations show a significant decline in the frequencies and quality factors of the first four SR modes during the solar minimum. This decrease is especially notable in the first two modes and is greater than previously recorded in earlier solar minima.

2. **Influence of Solar Activity**: Schumann resonances, which depend on ionospheric conductivity, are affected by changes in solar X-ray radiation. Reduced solar activity during minima lowers ionospheric conductivity, resulting in a decrease in SR frequencies.

3. **Lightning Activity and Effective Thunderstorm Areas**: The study assesses global lightning activity, a primary driver of SR excitation. Results indicate that effective lightning area reduces, and the disparity in thunderstorm activity between northern and southern hemispheres diminishes significantly during the deep solar minimum.

4. **Unusually Deep Solar Minimum**: The 2008-2009 solar minimum was one of the quietest on record, with exceptionally low sunspot counts and reduced X-ray flux. This intensified the observed effects on SR frequencies, providing valuable insights into how solar cycles impact atmospheric and electromagnetic dynamics.

This research reinforces the link between solar cycle phases and SR variations, with deeper solar minima producing more pronounced shifts in SR characteristics. These findings enhance our understanding of atmospheric and ionospheric processes affected by space weather.
