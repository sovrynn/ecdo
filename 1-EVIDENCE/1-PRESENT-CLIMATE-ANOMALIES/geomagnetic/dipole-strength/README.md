# Dipole Strength

## Falling since 700 AD

"The magnetic field has reversed polarity at different intervals during different geological periods. During the Cretaceous period 90 million years ago and the Permian period 170 million years ago, we know that no reversals occurred because the rocks that formed during those periods share the same polarity. During the past 90 million years reversals have steadily become more frequent. The core changes too rapidly to account easily for such long-term behavior. /// Some features of the field move and form at a rapid pace whereas others remain stationary. This phenomenon suggests some external influence. ///  If the temperature increased in the deep mantle, particularly beneath southern Africa or Indonesia, the formation of the reverse-flux features could accelerate, thereby precipitating reversals."

Pretty severe drop since around 700 AD

## Earth's geomagnetic dipole weakening

This seems fairly well documented in the literature.

"Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century. At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years. However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual."

### Paper: Changes in earth’s dipole

"The dipole moment of Earth’s magnetic field has decreased by nearly 9% over the past 150 years and by about 30% over the past 2,000 years according to archeomagnetic measurements. Here, we explore the causes and the implications of this rapid change. Maps of the geomagnetic field on the core–mantle boundary derived from ground-based and satellite measurements reveal that most of the present episode of dipole moment decrease originates in the southern hemisphere. Weakening and equatorward advection of normal polarity magnetic field by the core flow, combined with proliferation and growth of regions where the magnetic polarity is reversed, are reducing the dipole moment on the core–mantle boundary. Growth of these reversed flux regions has occurred over the past century or longer and is associated with the expansion of the South Atlantic Anomaly, a low-intensity region in the geomagnetic field that presents a radiation hazard at satellite altitudes. We address the speculation that the present episode of dipole moment decrease is a precursor to the next geomagnetic polarity reversal. The paleomagnetic record contains a broad spectrum of dipole moment fluctuations with polarity reversals typically occurring during dipole moment lows. However, the dipole moment is stronger today than its long time average, indicating that polarity reversal is not likely unless the current episode of moment decrease continues for a thousand years or more."

### Paper: Future Inversion of the Magnetic Field and Possible Changes in the Structure of the Magnetosphere

"IGRF-12 model data have been used to analyze the change in the global structure of internal sources of the Earth’s magnetic field. A decrease in the dipole magnetic moment is accompanied by a rapid growth of multipole moments. This justifies the theoretical model of the magnetic field inversion as a gradual decrease in the dipole field with general conservation of its direction and amplification of multipole moments. Paleo- and archeomagnetic data indicate that this process has already been taking place for almost 2.5 thousand years and has occurred repeatedly many times in the past. A decrease in the dipole magnetic moment leads the magnetopause to approach the Earth to disappear completely in almost 1.5 thousand years."

## Depletion of Earth's Magnetic Field

"The field has been weakening since Carl Friedrich Gauss measured it around 1836, by about 5% per century, recently accelerating to 7%/century. The total energy of the field however is nearly constant, as shown by the late Ned Benton. This means that the field is not really weakening, only reshuffling its energy, reducing the "main dipole" (=north-south bar-magnet pattern, declining as noted by about 7% per century) and reinforcing the more complicated parts."
