# Recent North Pole Wander

## North Pole Wander [1]

A low pass Fourier filter reveals a strong harmonic fit across all three data sets over a 33 year period.

I've overlaid a record of the Earth's axial wobble (x-axis) onto the existing data,  just for the short period spanning the available 'wobble' recordings and a little before. Angular Momentum Perturbation (AMP) events (large circles) are the Neptune/Uranus bumps in the Sun's blue curve. i've circled what appear to be 'microwobbles' in the earth's rotation around the time of the Uranus/Neptune bumps.

Added the other polar rotation axis to this chart. The same anomaly is clearly seen in both the X and Y directions, and its remarkably similar in movement to the Sun's wobble.

For lack of available peer-review, I obtained the dimestore appraisal as a starting point: 

"The Sun-SSB curve seems to exhibit periodicity that correlates with not only the polar nutation data but also the NMP wander and the polar motion perturbations. While it's unclear if these correlations indicate direct causality, they suggest synchronous behavior in the system driven by underlying gravitational influences. The amplified magnetic polar wander seen since the 1990s also coincides with increasing Sun-SSB displacement. This could be interpreted as the Earth experiencing a shift in its internal magnetic field, driven or influenced by gravitational forces." - GPT

I've added the Earth's polar motion (1973-2024) to a sub-period of the previous chart.

## North Magnetic Pole and Planetary Harmonics (1600-2024) [1]

North Magnetic Pole and Planetary Harmonics (1600-2024). Could the planets be influencing Earth's magnetic dipole? Observed NMP path deviations are marked in white. Deviations >270° in pink. Significant velocity changes are in green. I've also marked several key events during the last century on this timeline which may have been catalyzed by observations of the rapidly accelerating magnetic reversal (or excursion). Preparing for pole shifts requires a lot of money. Wars are extremely profitable, both financially and technologically. Having the freedom to print cash out of thin air even more so.

## NOAA Data

![north pole](img/npw2.jpg "north pole")

Courtesy of NOAA, showing that that the Np has traversed more in the past 25 years than it did in the 400 years before that. Sp is more consistent, but has similarly covered over 2000km headed in pretty much one direction.

## Alternative Magnetic North Pole Wander Video (1840 - 2019)

Alternate magnetic north pole wander video which also shows a comparison to the scale of the Earth. Original video at `img/npw.mp4`. It is compiled from historic observational and SWARM data. Note the apparent >270° deviation that occurred in the mid-1800's.

## British Geological Survey [2]

"The British Geological Survey is a partly publicly funded body which aims to advance geoscientific knowledge of the United Kingdom landmass and its continental shelf by means of systematic surveying, monitoring and research. The BGS headquarters are in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, England."

### The Great North Run [3]

The British Geological Survey seems to verify that Earth's magnetic field is undergoing changes:

"The 2021 revision of the model predicts that the direction of magnetic north will be the same as the direction of true north and grid north at the Isle of Purbeck/Poole in Dorset in November/December 2022. The point of coincidence of these three norths will then itself move northwards, passing Skipton in North Yorkshire in first half of 2024 and expected to reach Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire some time in 2026. These later predictions will need refining nearer the time to account for any sudden and poorly understood changes in the magnetic field known as jerks or impulses."

"The National Centers for Environmental Information is a U.S. government agency that manages one of the world's largest archives of atmospheric, coastal, geophysical, and oceanic data. The current director is Derek Arndt."

### Wandering of the Geomagnetic Poles [4]

"It has been long understood that dip poles migrate over time. In 1831, James Clark Ross located the north dip pole position in northern Canada. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) tracked the North Magnetic Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to reestablish the Pole's location from 1948 to 1994. An international collaboration, led by a French fundraising association, Poly-Arctique, and involving NRCan, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere, added two locations of the North Magnetic Pole in 2001 and 2007. The most recent survey determined that the Pole is moving approximately north-northwest at 55km per year."
