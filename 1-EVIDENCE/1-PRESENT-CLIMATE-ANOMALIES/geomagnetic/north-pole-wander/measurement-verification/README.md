# North Pole Wander Measurement Verification

## British Geological Survey [2]

"The British Geological Survey is a partly publicly funded body which aims to advance geoscientific knowledge of the United Kingdom landmass and its continental shelf by means of systematic surveying, monitoring and research. The BGS headquarters are in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, England."

### The Great North Run [3]

The British Geological Survey seems to verify that Earth's magnetic field is undergoing changes:

"The 2021 revision of the model predicts that the direction of magnetic north will be the same as the direction of true north and grid north at the Isle of Purbeck/Poole in Dorset in November/December 2022. The point of coincidence of these three norths will then itself move northwards, passing Skipton in North Yorkshire in first half of 2024 and expected to reach Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire some time in 2026. These later predictions will need refining nearer the time to account for any sudden and poorly understood changes in the magnetic field known as jerks or impulses."

## NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information)

"The National Centers for Environmental Information is a U.S. government agency that manages one of the world's largest archives of atmospheric, coastal, geophysical, and oceanic data. The current director is Derek Arndt."

### Wandering of the Geomagnetic Poles [4]

"It has been long understood that dip poles migrate over time. In 1831, James Clark Ross located the north dip pole position in northern Canada. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) tracked the North Magnetic Pole, which is slowly drifting across the Canadian Arctic, by periodically carrying out magnetic surveys to reestablish the Pole's location from 1948 to 1994. An international collaboration, led by a French fundraising association, Poly-Arctique, and involving NRCan, Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere, added two locations of the North Magnetic Pole in 2001 and 2007. The most recent survey determined that the Pole is moving approximately north-northwest at 55km per year."

Nothing more than a good summary.
