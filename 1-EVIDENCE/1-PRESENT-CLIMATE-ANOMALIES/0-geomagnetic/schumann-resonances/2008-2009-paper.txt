For the period 1988–2002, it has been shown that the SR mode frequencies and Q-factors decrease with
the decrease of X-ray radiation toward the solar cycle minimum (Sa´ tori et al., 2005). In the present study, a
decrease of frequencies and Q-factors of all first four SR modes from the latest solar cycle maximum to the
anomalous minimum of 2008–2009 is found using the data from Modra Observatory. Decreases obtained
here for the first two SR modes are evidently greater than those obtained in the study cited above.
Moreover, effective thunderstorm areas are calculated from the monthly mean diurnal frequency range of
the electric field component. Our study reveals that the difference between the northern and the southern
hemisphere summer areas not only declines with the decrease in solar activity but almost vanishes during
the deep solar minimum of 2008–2009. Semi-annual variation in the areas dominates in years of the deep
solar minimum.

1. Introduction
The cavity between the conductive Earth and the conductive
ionosphere is a global spherical waveguide for electromagnetic
waves, which are permanently excited by the lightning activity
predominantly in the three major regions: Maritime Continent,
Africa and South America. Schumann (1952) predicted theoreti-
cally the existence of the resonant modes, called Schumann
resonances (SR), due to interference of the electromagnetic waves
within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. These resonance modes
are in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range and they are close to
8, 14, 20, 26 Hz, etc.
The diurnal and seasonal variability of the SR parameters (peak
frequency, relative amplitude and quality factor) for individual
modes have been studied by, e.g. Balser and Wagner (1960), Ogawa
et al. (1969), Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz (1995), Sa´ tori and Zieger
(1996), Sa´ tori (1996), Price and Melnikov (2004) and Ondra´ ˇskova´
et al. (2007).
Several studies have documented that SR parameters vary on
the 11-year time scale of the solar cycle (Sa´ tori et al., 2000, 2005;
F ¨ullekrug et al., 2002; Kulak et al., 2003). A decrease of all modal
frequencies and Q-factors from the solar cycle maximum to the
minimum in 1996–1997 was found. For example, a decrease of the
yearly mean of the first mode frequency by 0.07 Hz was found at
Nagycenk from the electric field component, by 0.13 Hz at Arrival
Heights in the Antarctic and by 0.2 Hz at Rhode Island (USA) from
the magnetic field component (Sa´ tori et al., 2005). Using a two-
characteristic layer model of the lower ionosphere (Greifinger et al.,
2007) these changes in SR frequencies can be interpreted as the
X-ray induced modification of the conductivity profile confined to
the upper characteristic layer (Sa´ tori et al., 2005). The sensitivity of
the upper characteristic layer’s position on the X-ray flux variation
is logarithmic, hence the hundredfold decrease of the X-ray flux
over the solar cycle causes only a small change in conductivity
profile and thus a relatively small change in the SR frequencies
(Sa´ tori et al., 2005).
The diurnal frequency range (DFR) of SR is the band in which the
resonance frequency shifts up and down during the day. This
variation of frequency is caused by daily movement of the con-
tinental-size lightning region (source of the SR) from one continent
to another around the globe, i.e. source–observer distance (SOD)
changes for a fixed observational site. The value of DFR is related to
the size of this lightning region, which is in theoretical considera-
tions approximated by a single circular area moving along the
equator. The wider the region, the smaller the DFR, and vice versa
(Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz, 1995; Nickolaenko and Hayakawa,
2002) and this is valid for each SR mode. This relation for the first
two SR modes is demonstrated in Sa´ tori et al. (2009, Figure 16.8)
where DFRs and satellite observations of the three main lightning
region diameters are compared. All three main lightning areas are
greater in Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer than in Southern
Hemisphere (SH) summer due to the greater land areas there.
Moreover, having a record of daily variations of the SR mode
frequency derived from the vertical electric field component one
can evaluate the effective source width using the ‘‘calibrating
curve’’ (Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz, 1995; Nickolaenko and

Hayakawa, 2002). It can be assumed that an increase/decrease of
the effective lightning area means an increase/decrease of real
thunderstorm areas.
Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz (1995) found a nonlinear relation
between the effective lightning area and the lightning flash rate,
showing that the former can be considered a measure of the latter.
Indeed, Sa´ tori and Zieger (2003) studied the areal variations of
the global lightning activity on different timescales and showed
that the annual and semi-annual areal variations exhibit decadal
(11-year) modulations.
Furthermore, it was shown that the intensity of SR is linked to
the temperature of the tropical atmosphere (Williams, 1992). The
link is a lightning flash rate, which increases nonlinearly with
temperature. Thus, the yearly mean of the effective lightning area
can be considered a measure of the mean temperature.
According to NASA web page (http://www.nasa.gov/topics/
solarsystem/features/solar_minimum09.html) the present solar
cycle minimum of 2008–2009 was extraordinarily deep. There
were no sunspots observed on 266 of the year’s 366 days (73%) in
2008. Sunspot counts for 2009 dropped even lower. As of March
31st, there were no sunspots on 78 of those 90 days (87%). That was
the quietest sun we have seen in almost a century. Careful
measurements by several NASA spacecraft showed that the sun’s
brightness dropped by 0.02% at visible wavelengths and 6% at
extreme UV wavelengths since the solar minimum of 1996. The
X-ray radiation, which ionizes the Earth’s atmosphere and is
responsible for the conductivity profile of the ionosphere, was
by an order of magnitude lower than in solar cycle minima studied
previously (http://goes.ngdc.noaa.gov/data/avg/).
In this paper, we present results of measurements of the electric
field SR component from October 2001 to July 2009 at the Modra
Observatory. This nearly 8-year interval is long enough to resolve
the SR parameter variability on the 11-year time scale using the
data from the solar cycle maximum to the anomalous solar cycle
minimum in 2008–2009. More pronounced variations are expected
in this minimum, which differs from the minimum studied by
Sa´ tori et al. (2005). Areas of the effective global lightning regions
are calculated from our SR data and variations of these areas
from the solar cycle maximum toward this deep minimum are
analysed too.
2. Measuring equipment and data processing
Monitoring of the vertical electric field SR component has been
performed at the Astronomical and Geophysical Observatory (AGO)
of Comenius University near Modra, Slovakia (48.37 N, 17.27 E,
530 m a.s.l.). From October 2001 to July 2009 there were practically
no interruptions except for the six cases when measuring hardware
or software was being updated or repaired, which lasted about a
month, or short interruptions due to power outages or unfavour-
able weather situations (in some cases days).
The electric field SR component is recorded with a capacitive
(ball) antenna mounted on a 5 m insulator mast. Details are given in
Kostecky´ et al. (2000) and in Ondra´ ˇskova´ et al. (2007).
Since October 2001 through July 2006, the raw time series data
were collected every half hour for 327.68 s (which is 65,536
samples taken with 200 Hz sampling frequency), supplying 48
files per day. In the following text, this regime is referred to as a
Measurement Regime 1 (MR1). Since then data of the same length
have been collected more frequently: every 6 min, i.e. 240 files are
stored per day. This regime is referred here as a Measurement
Regime 2 (MR2).
Each sequence of data was subjected to discrete Fourier trans-
form (DFT). The frequency resolution of the obtained spectrum is
3.05 mHz. These raw SR spectra from Modra observatory (AGO) up
to August 4, 2009, can be viewed at a new address at http://195.80.
191.82/.
In the second step, the raw spectra were smoothed with 25-
point moving averages. To remove the low-frequency noise the
frequency range 6–45 Hz was retained from DFT spectra for further
processing. Then the principal parameters for the first five modes
(frequency F, quality factor Q and amplitude A) were computed by
the least square method (LSM) fitting of spectra by the sum of five
Lorentz functions. Subroutines from the GSL library (http://www.
gnu.org/software/gsl) were implemented in the fitting code. The
fitting process was performed in a modified way as given in
Ondra´ ˇskova´ et al. (2007). Since therein the dispersion of output
parameters (e.g. frequency) was too great in some months, the
whole investigated period was once more processed with more
strict criteria for selection of ‘‘good’’ results of the fitting process
and, moreover, for five modes. The following ranges of frequencies
and Q-factors were applied: mode 1 (7.2–8.2 Hz; 1.2–10), mode 2
(13.0–15.0 Hz; 1.4–10), mode 3 (19.2–21.4 Hz; 2–11), mode 4
(24.8–27.5 Hz; 2–12) and mode 5 (31–33 Hz; 2–12). This mod-
ification of criteria removed majority of bad results of the fitting
process while the patterns of the diurnal variations of SR modes
remain essentially the same as in Ondra´ ˇskova´ et al. (2007).
There are other techniques for determining the modal frequen-
cies. Sa´ tori et al. (2009) used a method of the complex demodula-
tion. It has been shown that slightly different values for frequency
can be produced with different methods. This may affect the DFR
evaluation and subsequently the absolute values of the effective
lightning areas.
In order to find the influence of the last solar cycle on the SR the
satellite data of X-ray fluxes were used. Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES) have an unobstructed view of the
sun for all but the few dozen hours per year when the Earth eclipses
the sun. Ion chamber detectors provide whole-sun X-ray fluxes for
the 0.05–0.3 nm (0.05–0.4 nm prior to GOES-8) and 0.1–0.8 nm
wavelength bands. We used 5 min averages of the GOES-10
0.1–0.8 nm data as they are available in the whole studied period.
These data, available through the Solar-Terrestrial Physics Division
of the National Geophysical Data Centre, were used to calculate
daily and monthly averages.
3. Diurnal frequency variations
Generally, the diurnal frequency variation pattern of each mode
is predominantly determined by the source–observer geometry
(Sa´ tori et al., 2003; Sa´ tori et al., 2009). The variations in frequency
for the electric field component for the first, second and third SR
modes obtained here are shown in Figs. 1–3, respectively. There are
graphs of the diurnal variation of frequency for every month of the
year and for about 8 years of measurements. These plots were
obtained from monthly means of peak frequencies using Be´ zier
spline interpolation (GNUPLOT package), which seems to be more
suitable for the determination of representative daily variation for a
given month than ‘‘classical’’ cubic splines. Moreover, still slightly
scattered values of frequencies from the Lorentzian fitting process
called for some kind of interpolation.
The overall pattern in the whole year corresponds to the annual
transition from the ‘‘winter-type’’ to the ‘‘summer-type’’ diurnal
frequency variation and back to the ‘‘winter-type’’ one. Latitudinal
movement of the sources over the year can explain the observed
annual changes in the pattern of the diurnal variation.
Generally, thanks to the proximity of the two observatories, our
diurnal frequency variation curves are very similar to the curves
obtained at Nagycenk in 1993–1995 (Sa´ tori and Zieger, 1996). On
the other hand, a slight difference can be seen if our results are
compared with the diurnal frequency variation of the first 3 modes
A. Ondra´ˇskova´ et al. / Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 73 (2011) 534–543 535
reported by Price and Melnikov (2004, last column in Fig. 4 therein),
which is given as a 3-month average variation calculated from
4-year averages. This difference arises from the different SOD of the
Mitzpe Ramon station in Israel. Secondly, comparison with the
Price and Melnikov curves of the diurnal variation is not completely
appropriate due to the fact that they show 3-month averages.
As expected from the theory our average diurnal frequency
patterns are different for the three modes and each mode shows a
distinct seasonal variation. This has been already reported by Sa´ tori
and Zieger (1996). The curves for the first mode show only one
primary maximum and one minimum in frequency, with their
times varying with the season. In winter months (November–
March) the minimum frequency occurs at Modra at about 9 UT,
while in June–July the first mode frequency has its minimum in
afternoon hours and maximum around 9 UT.
Sa´ tori and Zieger (1996) have shown that the transition from the
winter to the summer pattern occurs in some years in April and in
other years in May. As can be seen from Fig. 1, curves for May have
indications of the summer pattern in 2004–2009. In June and July,
all curves exhibit the summer pattern, which persists in August
2006, 2007 and 2008. Thus our study reveals a tendency that the
summer-type diurnal variation shortens during the studied solar
cycle maximum and lengthens during the studied minimum.
Nevertheless, the summer-type diurnal variation lasts shorter than
the winter-type diurnal variation in all phases of the studied
solar cycle.
The pattern of the diurnal variation for higher modes is an
increasingly humped curve as the number of nodal lines grows
with growing mode number, which follows from the form of zonal
harmonics (Legendre polynomials) (Nickolaenko, 1997). The diur-
nal variation of the second mode as observed at Modra is depicted
in Fig. 2. The MR1 data were used in the period October 2001–July
2006. The MR2 data are available since August 2006 and the
corresponding curves show more pronounced humps than in
previous years. In winter, the curves reveal a deep minimum at
around 14 UT and two maxima at 2 and 20 UT. A secondary
minimum is more pronounced in 2007–2009, i.e. in years when
MR2 data collection was used. As this pattern repeats in the
mentioned 3 years and in all winter months, it must be a real
feature. April and September are transition months when the
winter pattern of the diurnal variation changes for the summer one
and vice versa. In summer months there is a wide maximum
around 12 UT in years of the solar cycle maximum, which splits into
two maxima in 2007–2009, when MR2 data are available.

cycle maximum, and different thin lines for years of the solar cycle minimum. Colour appears in web version. Note the analogical patterns in different years in all months.
October 2001 through July 2006 data are taken every half hour (measurement regime MR1). Fine details on the diurnal pattern since August 2006 are caused by the use of
‘‘6-minute’’ data (measurement regime MR2).

The diurnal frequency variation of the 3rd mode is depicted in
Fig. 3. Similar to the second mode, the fine details are more
pronounced since August 2006 when MR2 data are used.
Fig. 4 shows a combination of diurnal and annual frequency
variations from January 2002 to July 2009 as pseudo-three-dimen-
sional maps. Maps for modes one through four are arranged from left
to right; the data for years 2002 through 2009 from top to bottom. The
white points or areas represent the missing, unreliable or out-of-
range data. The diurnal frequency variations from Figs. 1–3 seem to be
visible also in maps in Fig. 4. Unfortunately, the ‘‘map form’’ cannot
show them in detail.
On the other hand, considering the inter-annual variations, a
comparison between subsequent years 2002–2009 shows that the
frequencies monotonically decrease. This clear decrease of the
mean diurnal frequency level, which appears in all modes with
the same sign, can be attributed to changes in conductivity of
ionospheric layer toward the solar cycle minimum (Sa´ tori et al.,
2005) and to a diminished wave speed within the Earth-ionosphere
cavity. Details of this decrease are discussed in Section 5.
4. The diurnal frequency range and the effective source width
In order to obtain a consistent homogeneous database, all our
data were selected in all years in the MR1 (i.e. with the measure-
ment duration of 327.68 s each half hour) and this selection was
used for the computation of the DFR values, i.e. the difference
between the maximal and the minimal frequencies on a
diurnal curve.
The first and the second mode DFRs are listed in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively, and depicted in upper graph in Fig. 5. In a month when
we do not have a DFR value due to measurement interruption the
DFR value is calculated as an average of the value in the same
month a year before and a year after that month.
Comparing with DFR values from Nagycenk we find system-
atically higher values of our DFRs. This difference can be attributed
to our method for determining the peak SR frequencies using
Lorentzians and subsequent fitting the diurnal variation by Bezier
splines while Nagycenk frequencies were determined by the
complex demodulation method. Therefore, the absolute values of
the source widths, calculated below, will be smaller but the trends
or periodical changes are not dependent on the technique of DFR
determination.
Theoretical calibration curves, which allow us to transform the
DFR¼FMAX
(t)FMIN (t) in Hz into the effective source width mea-
sured in hours, depend primarily on the position of observational
site. Calibration curves were computed for a model based on the
assumption that the lightning discharges were uniformly distrib-
uted in a single circular area and its diameter is measured in hours.
The centre of this area moved uniformly along the equator. The
propagation constants at resonant frequencies were derived from
experimental data (Bliokh et al., 1980) and their values in the whole
SR frequency range was calculated by interpolation and extra-
polation. The calibration curves computed for Nagycenk (47.61N,

16.71E) for the first and second SR modes are available, e.g. in
Nickolaenko et al. (1998).
Thanks to the proximity of Modra Observatory to Nagycenk
(103 km), which is very short in comparison to SR wavelength, we
decided to use these calibration curves derived for Nagycenk
geographical latitude to evaluate the effective lightning areas using
our data. The obtained source diameters in degrees are listed in
Table 3 and depicted in the middle graph in Fig. 5. As one can see,
results from both modes vary similarly. The maxima derived from
mode 1 are mostly in the same month as the maxima derived from
mode 2. A difference by 211 appears in the estimates deduced from
the two modes in a single month. The difference of these values is
comparable to the differences in Sa´ tori and Zieger (2003) and Sa´ tori
et al. (2007). Due to this variability the effective lightning area is
calculated as a mean of the two mode values.
Averages of the effective source widths deduced from the first
and the second modes are shown in the lower graph in Fig. 5. This
graph and the corresponding values arranged in Table 3 show a
pronounced annual variation in the effective lightning areas reach-
ing maxima in spring (April–May) and in autumn (August–
September). A mean annual variation calculated as averages of
specific months is given in the last but one row of Table 3. The
effective source of SR has a minimum width of 39.01 in February
and a maximum width of 62.91 in May. Our results, though based on
only one solar cycle, verify the annual periodical changes of the
effective thunderstorm areas that have been identified by Sa´ tori
and Zieger (2003) for the previous solar cycle.
As seen from Table 3, the yearly mean effective source diameter
varies in a range from 51.841 in 2005 to 47.971 in 2008. The
standard deviation is high, being 8.98 in 2008 up to 12.88 in 2005,
as its value is influenced by the inherent annual variation of great
amplitude (almost 121, see the last but one row of Table 3). Though
the yearly mean values seem to decrease, no statistically significant
trend of yearly mean value of the effective lightning area can be
deduced.
Moreover, Sa´ tori and Zieger (2003) and Sa´ tori et al. (2007)
showed that the annual changes in source areas, namely the
difference between summer solstice (June, July, August) and winter
solstice (December, January, February) areas exhibit decadal
modulation. They showed that the magnitude of the annual varia-
tion slightly but evidently decreased with the decrease in solar
activity. However, our data from 2002 to 2009 show that the north–
south hemisphere asymmetry in lightning areas, which was
significant in the solar cycle maximum, not only decreased, but
almost vanished in the deep solar cycle minimum in 2008–2009.
The thick full curve interconnecting mean values for June–August
and the thick dashed curve interconnecting mean December–
February values joined in 2008–2009, see the bottom graph in
Fig. 5. From this fact it can be concluded that in the solar cycle
minimum, thunderstorms in the NH summer cover the same-size

harmony with a decrease of the effective lightning area deduced
from Nagycenk data for NH summer of 1996 (former solar
minimum) by Sa´ tori et al. (2007). Naturally, similar observations
covering the anomalous minimum of 2008–2009 could not be

months (December–February) caused that semi-annual variation
dominated in years of the solar cycle minimum, see the bottom
graph of Fig. 5.
Though the circular lightning region assumed in the model is
centred on the equator, in the NH summer months, this region
widens and covers not only the tropics but also middle latitudes. As
mentioned above, the lightning region diameters presented here
are likely underestimated. If we changed the method of frequency
determination for complex demodulation the obtained diameters
might be even larger (compare the diameters given in Sa´ tori et al.,
2007) and the effective lightning region might expand up to higher
middle latitudes.
One of the mechanisms to explain the above discussed reduced
size of the effective thunderstorm area in NH leaving SH unchanged
was suggested in Sa´ tori et al. (2007) and is as follows. In the NH
summer, a lot of lightning activity occurs also at higher-middle
latitudes. It has been shown that lightning over Britain and
Germany follows the solar activity (Stringfellow, 1974; Schlegel
et al., 2001). As there is no corresponding lightning belt in higher
middle latitudes in the SH, the reduced solar activity would affect
only NH lightning. The Optical Transient Detector satellite light-
ning observations over North Europe (4501N) also showed a
minimum in flash rate in the solar cycle minimum of 1996–1997,
see also Sa´ tori et al. (2007). Unfortunately, there are no similar
high-latitudinal flash observations covering the anomalous mini-
mum of 2008–2009.
Finally, Fig. 6 depicts the results of spectral analyses of the DFR
temporal variations for the first two SR modes. Both modes show
maxima around the annual and semi-annual periods and higher
annual harmonics appear as well. It is interesting that despite our
data were taken about 10 years later and from longer interval (92
months), we obtain the same result as Nickolaenko et al. (1998),
namely that the amplitude of the semi-annual period is larger
than that of the annual period in case of the first SR mode. The

semi-annual variation can be attributed to the periodical lightning
activity at equinoxes while the north–south asymmetry in the land
distribution over the globe can explain the one-year period.
5. 11-Year variation of the SR parameters
As the source–observer geometry repeats every year it is
understandable that the diurnal frequency variation curves for
all years and for all 4 investigated modes have nearly the same
pattern.
The inter-annual difference between the curves seen in Fig. 1
exhibits a systematic or quasi-systematic decrease of frequency
from 2001–2002 (year of the solar cycle maximum) to 2008–2009
(year of the solar cycle minimum). The full bold curve is for 2001,
and the lowest thin dotted curve is for 2009. The average difference
between the curve for 2002 and the curve for 2008 is 0.2–0.4 Hz.
Similar quasi-systematic decrease of the diurnal variation curves is
evident in Figs. 2 and 3.
To study the long-term changes the monthly mean values of the
first, second, third and fourth mode frequencies and Q-factors were
calculated and the obtained values are depicted in Fig. 7. The third
mode manifests the most pronounced annual variation but a
decrease of all frequencies and all Q-factors toward the solar cycle
minimum in 2009 is evident. GOES satellite 5 min averages of the
solar X-radiation flux in 0.1–0.8 nm range (http://goes.ngdc.noaa.
gov/data/avg/) were used to compute monthly means and the
results are plotted in Fig. 7 too. A smooth full line is the Bezier
interpolation. A deep minimum of this flux appeared from June
2008 up to May 2009. That is why all yearly means are calculated

from June to May of the next year. The yearly mean value of the
X-ray flux in the wavelength interval 0.1–0.8 nm decreased from
1.23  10 6 W m2 (June 2002–May 2003) to 4.05  109 W m2
(June 2008–May 2009). In the same period, e.g. the first mode
frequency dropped from 7.84 Hz (June 2002–May 2003) to 7.55 Hz
(June 2008–May 2009).
The yearly mean values of frequencies and Q-factors of the
studied SR modes in the solar maximum are arranged in the first
row in Table 4, the corresponding values for the solar minimum in
the last row. For comparison, the yearly mean values for 2007 when
the X-ray flux reached the level of the previous solar cycle
minimum are listed in the second row.
A decrease of mode frequencies and quality factors over the
solar cycle has been explained by Sa´ tori et al. (2005) from the point
of view of changes in the two characteristic layers, which represent
the upper boundary of the waveguide, and which are responsible
for ELF wave propagation (see also Greifinger et al., 2007). On the
11-year time scale, the solar output in the X-ray range varies on
average by 2 orders of magnitude, in the ultraviolet range by a
factor of 2 and both are proportional to the solar activity, measured
by sunspot numbers. Cosmic rays, which are another ionization
source affecting mainly the lower characteristic layer (50–60 km),
also vary with the solar cycle but inversely. According to Sa´ tori et al.
(2005) changes of the X-ray radiation dominate the variations in
the conductivity profile within the upper characteristic layer (the
90–100 km portion of the E-region). The decrease of this conduc-
tivity by up to one order of magnitude over the solar cycle is
responsible for the observed SR frequencies decrease by several
tenths of Hz. Furthermore, the change in the scale height of the
conductivity profile modulates the reflection/dissipation effects
within the upper characteristic layer and, therefore, the Q-factors of
the resonator.
Our observations support the findings of Sa´tori et al. (2005) that the
variations of SR frequencies are in phase with the solar X-ray output
over the solar cycle, i.e. over the 11-year time scale, and our result at
another station serves to verify their global behaviour. Our electric field
component data show that the frequency of the first mode decreased
by 0.29 Hz from the latest solar maximum to the minimum in
2008–2009. The value obtained here is much greater than the
corresponding value of 0.07 Hz deduced by Sa´tori et al. (2005) but
for the previous solar cycle. Similarly, a decrease by 0.29 Hz was
obtained here for the second mode frequency while 0.10 Hz was
determined by Sa´tori et al. (2005). The greater drop of these frequencies
in the 2008–2009 solar cycle minimum can be attributed to the very
low level of solar activity and thus also a very low level of solar output in
the X-ray range since June 2008, which is by one order of magnitude
lower than that during the previous minimum of 1996–1997.
The level of the solar X-ray radiation (in 0.1–0.8 nm range) in the
previous solar minimum was about 3.6  108 W m2 (Sa´ tori
et al., 2005). In the studied solar cycle, the X-ray flux of this order
was reached in 2007 (January–December). In 2007, according to
our observations, the yearly mean value of the first Schumann
resonance frequency was 7.68 Hz. It means that by that time the
first SR mode decreased by 0.16 Hz, a value similar to the values
obtained by Sa´ tori et al. (2005) from the SR magnetic component
data. A decrease of the other modes by 0.19, 0.08 and 0.13 Hz,
respectively, reached in 2007 is also comparable with the results
obtained for the previous solar minimum.
Unfortunately, no Q-factor values were evaluated from Nagy-
cenk electric component data. Decreases by 0.65, 0.80, 0.73 and
0.97 of the Q-factor for the four studied SR modes were found here
(Table 4). As expected, these values are greater than the decreases
reported in Sa´ tori et al. (2005) for the previous solar cycle though
deduced from the SR magnetic component.
6. Conclusions
Observations of SR at Modra that cover the period from the solar
cycle maximum in 2001–2002 to the anomalous solar cycle
minimum in 2008–2009 are in harmony with the results of
Sa´ tori et al. (2005) but our measurements reveal greater decrease
of the first two SR mode frequencies.
The decrease of the Q-factors derived here from the electric
component is found greater than in the previous minimum of solar
activity derived from the magnetic component.
It was found that the effective lightning area in the NH summer
months (June, July, August) decreased so much that the difference
between the NH summer and the SH summer areas not only
diminished with the decrease in solar activity, but even almost
vanished during the deep minimum of 2008–2009. At the same
time, no statistically significant decrease of the yearly mean
diameter of the effective lightning area was found.
As discussed in Section 4, the higher middle latitude lightning
region in the NH likely shrank or almost vanished with the decrease
in solar activity. In other words it seems that much less lightning
occurred in the northern higher latitudes in summer in the years
of the deep solar cycle minimum of 2008–2009 than in other phases
of the solar cycle. Though this finding is supported by the two
studies of local lightning flash rate it should be verified in further
investigations using data from worldwide lightning networks. It
should be noted that a lot of lightning still occurred in the tropics.
This effect of diminishing of the effective lightning area in NH
summer months can be identified also in results of Sa´ tori and Zieger
(2003) and Sa´ tori et al. (2007) for the previous ‘‘ordinary’’ solar
cycle minimum but it is not as pronounced as here using the data
from the anomalously deep minimum.
