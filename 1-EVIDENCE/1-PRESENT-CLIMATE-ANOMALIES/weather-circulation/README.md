## The Gulf Stream is on the verge of COLLAPSING, leading climate change scientists warn - plunging the UK into a new ice age

The network of ocean currents which keep the Earth's climate stable could be about to collapse, scientists have warned.

In an open letter, 44 of the world's leading climate scientists say that key Atlantic Ocean currents - including the Gulf Stream - are on the brink of failure.

The scientists caution that the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could lead to 'devastating and irreversible impacts' which will affect 'the entire world for centuries to come'.

The resulting climate fallout could plunge the UK into a 'new Ice Age', with winter temperatures plummetting up to 15°C (27°F) below the current average. 

While the collapse of the Gulf Stream would be disastrous for Britain, that vital current is just one small part of AMOC's massive global system.

This giant ocean conveyor belt is critical for moving heat around the planet, but research suggests that it has been slowing down and could soon reach a tipping point.

Without urgent action, the scientists warn that AMOC could fail completely within the next few decades.
