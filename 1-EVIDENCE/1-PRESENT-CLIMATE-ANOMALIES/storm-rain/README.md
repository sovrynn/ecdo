"Table 1 shows return period and risk ratio of the 2018 extreme flooding under different scenarios. Without any anthropogenic influence (NAT scenario), this extreme event occurs frequently with a 5-yr (95% CI: 3â€“10 yr) return period. When anthropogenic cli- mate change, land cover change, and reservoir opera- tion are gradually considered, the risk ratio decreases to 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56â€“0.82), 0.55 (95% CI: 0.44â€“0.68), and 0.1 (95% CI: 0.04â€“0.17) respectively. The risk ratio decreases significantly by 0.34 (95% CI: 0.18â€“0.44) from NAT to FIXED_CSSPv2, by 0.11 (95% CI: 0.08â€“0.21) from FIXED_CSSPv2 to LUCC_CSSPv2, and by 0.45 (95% CI: 0.34â€“0.57) from LUCC_CSSPv2 to YRCC observed streamflow scenarios."

## US Rainfall increasing

"On average, total annual precipitation has increased over land areas in the United States and worldwide (see Figures 1 and 2). Since 1901, global precipitation has increased at an average rate of 0.03 inches per decade, while precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at a rate of 0.18 inches per decade." https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-precipitation

## Flooding

Even the collector of this material is so astounded by the volume of water seen in September that heâ€™s compiled it into a thread.

## Rainfall data fudging [1]

Where did all the water go? Further examples of altered rainfall data from 16 different cities around the world. Unusually high rainfall records for the past three years have been erased from the record.
