Potential explanation for the Scablands flood deposits based on the ECDO. The "Set S" tephta is an ash layer from Mt. Saint Helens and is a temporal marker for the termination of the Younger Dryas.

## Shetland

The Tsunami Sands of Scotland. "Recent evidence has suggested one such major event which took place some 7000 years ago. As a result of a massive under-sea landslide close to Norway a huge tidal wave, a tsunami, seems to have advanced southwards from Shetland along the east coast of Scotland. The height of the wave has been estimated at 8m (25ft), and this would clearly devastate the coastal areas that it hit."
- Scotland's First Settlers, Wickham-Jones (1994)

Found the precise unadjusted dating obtained from the Scottish tsunami sands - 5325 BC, or 7400 BP.  An exact match to the Noahic deluge on the harmonic timeline. The calibration they applied was to compensate for the presumed changes which the comet (or comets) would have caused to the ozone and C14 levels. If there was no comet, their adjustment would be unnecessary. [1,2]

Regarding the book's mention of flood elevation: "Says Castle Street, Inverness. Inverness lies between sea level and about 130m. Castle street must be about half that - around 50-60m asl at least." [2]
