## Black Sea Outflow, 6200 BC - 5500 BC

### William Ryan

Apparently the OG Black Sea deluge researcher. He has produced research from 1997 all the way up till very recently. His original thesis was around 5600 BC, he which he revised to 6200 BC in 2003.

1997 paper (hard copy here): https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/s0025-3227(97)00007-8

"influx commencing later at 7150 yr BP and initiated by a cascade of saltwater pouring into a partly-emptied Black Sea lake following the breaching of an intervening barrier."

William Ryan, Black Sea, 2003: Catastrophic Flooding of the Black Sea (hard copy in this folder)

"There is a compelling, but not irrefutable, possibility that the Black Sea experienced a catastrophic saltwater flood at 8.4 ky BP."

## Vredefort Impact Structure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_impact_structure

The unusually mineral rich composition of the crust here probably has something to do with the LLSVP intrusion and the Vredefort crater which exposed some of what was below. Agreed on the alternate concepts - I find valuable knowledge in most areas of inquiry, especially if its something new to me. 

## Opal (Australia)

Like all fine things, gem opal is exceedingly rare. Much of the world's precious opal is mined in the harsh outback of Australia, where a unique combination of geological conditions permitted the formation of opal near the margins of an ancient inland sea.
