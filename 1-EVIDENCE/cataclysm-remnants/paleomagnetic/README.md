Varved clay proxies provide sub-annular paleomagnetic resolutions. The following charts are taken from Annual and inter‐annual magnetic variations in varved clay, Nils‐Axel Mörner (1978)[1], wherein paleomagnetic findings from VC cores dated to ±13,150 BP (spanning 156 varves/years) and ±10,000 BP (spanning 300 varves/years) are shown. These two cores span the Gothenburg Flip & Excursion[2] and the Ornö Declination Departure.

What appears to be recorded in these proxies are multiple geomagnetic excursions and reversals which occurred within short succession, most within a few years to a couple of decades apart, with the majority reflecting a declination change of 80°-120°. This looks very much like what I would expect to see recorded from a series of ECDO-type events.

Coloured elements are my own additions. Blue and red indicate selected reversal points of magnetic declination. Orange numbers are the approximate number of varves/years between the reversals. Green curves and text indicate the approximate number of degrees change between the selected reversals. Raw chart values which exceed 180° have been subtracted from 360° and the absolute delta value displayed bracketed.

## Levantine Iron Age Anomaly (LIAA)

"Here we report archaeointensity data from Georgia showing high field values (VADM > 150 Z Am2) in the tenth or ninth century B.C.E., low field values (VADM < 60 Z Am2) in the twelfth century B.C.E., and fast field variation in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E. High field values in the time frame of LIAA have been observed so far only in three localities near the Levant: Eastern Anatolia, Turkmenistan, and now Georgia, all located east of longitude 30°E. West of this, in the Balkans, field values in the same time are moderate to low. These constraints put geographic limits on the extent of the LIAA and support the hypothesis of an unusually intense regional geomagnetic anomaly during the beginning of the first half of the first millennium B.C.E., comparable in area and magnitude (but of opposite sign) to the presently active South Atlantic anomaly."

"In addition, the study provides further evidence of extremely strong field in the late eighth century BCE (“geomagnetic spike”), and of rapid rates of change (>20% over three decades)."

## South Atlantic Anomaly [3]

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to Earth's surface, dipping down to an altitude of 200 kilometres (120 mi). This leads to an increased flux of energetic particles in this region and exposes orbiting satellites (including the ISS) to higher-than-usual levels of ionizing radiation.

The effect is caused by the non-concentricity of Earth and its magnetic dipole and has been observed to be increasing in intensity recently.[quantify] The SAA is the near-Earth region where Earth's magnetic field is weakest relative to an idealized Earth-centered dipole field.

## Paleomagnetic data: Earth rotation ~500 mm years ago

This paper is describing something which sounds remarkably similar to an ECDO state 2 to state 1 rotation a half a billion years ago:

"..at least two tectonic plates, involving more than two-thirds of Earth's continental lithosphere, were involved in a rapid rotation of ~90° relative to the spin axis. We speculate that the entire lithosphere may have been involved in this rotation. // The new ages, along with paleomagnetic data, indicate that continents moved at rapid rates that are difficult to reconcile with our present understanding of mantle dynamics.."

(continued...) "// The pole for this sequence is >80° away from the Vendian-Early Cambrian poles, implying that Australia underwent a large rotation while remaining near the equator sometime between Tommotian and Late Cambrian time. // Australia rotated counterclockwise during this time. // Antarctica, India, Africa, South America, and perhaps parts of East Asia also rotated with Australia. // True polar wander (TPW) is the process through which quasi-rigid spheroids align their maximum moments of inertia with the spin axis, pushing positive mass anomalies toward the rotational equator. // A variant of this mechanism, inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW), involves discrete bursts of TPW of up to 90° in geologically short intervals of time if the magnitudes of the intermediate and maximum moments of inertia cross. This would result in a rapid movement away from the spin axis by the geographic location of the former pole with rotation of the entire solid Earth centered about the minimum moment of inertia located on the equator. // These two poles, with their stated polarity interpretation, are separated by about 68°; together they yield a plausible tropical position for Siberia, nearly on the opposite side of the globe from Australia. // If the velocities are due to TPW, however, such geodynamical considerations are obviated because the entire mantle would have rotated along with the lithosphere."

# TODO Chatgpt: Notable Geomagnetic Excursions in Recent History

## 1. Laschamp Excursion (~41,000 years ago)
This is one of the most studied geomagnetic excursions, characterized by a significant drop in field intensity and a brief reversal of the magnetic field. Recent studies, such as those by [Nowaczyk et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ggge.20198) and [Laj et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.09.006), have used sediment cores and volcanic records to refine the timing and duration of the Laschamp event.

## 2. Mono Lake Excursion (~34,000 years ago)
The Mono Lake excursion is another well-documented event, recorded in sediments from Mono Lake, California. Research by [Lund et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.06.025) provides detailed paleomagnetic data showing the rapid changes in magnetic field direction and intensity associated with this excursion.

## 3. Gothenburg Excursion (~13,000 years ago)
This excursion, less widely accepted or documented compared to Laschamp and Mono Lake, has been proposed based on paleomagnetic data from the Nordic regions and other parts of Europe. It suggests a brief but notable deviation of the magnetic field.

## 4. Lake Mungo Excursion (~32,000 years ago)
This event is recorded in Australian lake sediments and is contemporaneous with the Mono Lake excursion. Studies, such as those by Roberts and Turner (2013), have explored its potential global significance.

## 5. Blake Excursion (~120,000–110,000 years ago)
The Blake excursion is another significant event documented in marine sediments and volcanic rocks. Research such as that by [Channell et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JB008968) provides insights into its chronology and characteristics.

  This study provides a detailed model of the Earth's magnetic field over the past 10,000 years, identifying several geomagnetic excursions and secular variation features.

# TODO Chatgpt: Recent Geomagnetic Excursions After the Gothenburg Excursion

## 1. **Hilina Pali Excursion (~8,000 years ago)**
This excursion is recorded in lava flows from Hawaii and other regions. It is characterized by a significant deviation in the geomagnetic field direction and intensity.

## 2. **Mungo Excursion (~6,000 years ago)**
Also known as the Holocene anomaly, this event is not the same as the older Lake Mungo excursion. It shows a distinct deviation in the geomagnetic field, though its global extent is debated.

## 3. **Delta Excursion (~2,700 years ago)**
This excursion, identified in lake sediments and archaeological materials, shows rapid changes in the magnetic field intensity and direction around 700 BCE.

## 4. **Levanto Excursion (~3,000 years ago)**
Documented in several parts of the world, this excursion corresponds to a brief geomagnetic anomaly during the early first millennium BCE.

## 5. **Mono Lake Reversal (~34,000 years ago)**
Though not more recent than Gothenburg, it is worth mentioning because of its prominence and wide documentation across different regions.

## 6. **The Laschamp Event Revisited (~41,000 years ago)**
New research has refined the timing and characteristics of this event, making it a benchmark for understanding excursions during the last 100,000 years.

These events provide insight into the complex and dynamic nature of the Earth's magnetic field in recent geological history. They also highlight that geomagnetic field changes can occur much more rapidly and frequently than full-scale reversals.
