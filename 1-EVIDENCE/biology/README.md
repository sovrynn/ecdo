## The Wallace Line - The Invisible Wildlife Boundary

Alfred Russell Wallace, 1889

During his time in Indonesia, Wallace observed a peculiar division in animal life.

A clear and sudden change in the faunal content of Indonesia's many islands seemed to occur across an invisible border. Through analysis of the distribution of species, both by Wallace and other scientists, a line was drawn that illustrates this divide that splits Indonesia down the middle from north to south. It was named the Wallace Line by Thomas Henry Huxley in honour of its discoverer.
