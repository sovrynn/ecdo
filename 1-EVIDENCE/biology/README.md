## 2400 BCE Climate anomaly - Tree Rings

*"The mid-24th century BCE climate anomaly is the period, between 2354 and 2345 BCE, of consistently reduced annual temperatures that are reconstructed from consecutive abnormally narrow, Irish oak tree rings."*

### Tree-Rings Indicate Global Environmental Downturns that could have been Caused by Comet Debris - Baillie (hard copy here)

Interestingly the main paper referenced in this Wikipedia article also points to more recent dates (200 BC, approximately 540 AD) as other suspicious dates. He includes his own cataclysm compilation as well. Hard copy in this folder.

"For example, one of the Irish oak dates was 207 BC. In China events in 208 BC, and the years following, included a dim Sun, crop failures, famine and high death rates; and a new dynasty, the Han, is believed to have started in 206 (Pang et al. 1987). Meanwhile, in Europe, problems in Rome called for consultation of the Sibylline Books resulting in the return of the Goddess Cybele from Asia Minor; Cybele was manifest as a ‘small black meteorite.’ This latter occurrence made sense of a series of references by Livy to ‘stones falling from the sky’ and strange lights in the sky, ‘prodigies of Jupiter’, et cetera (Forsyth 1990). Clearly, dates around 207 BC might be expected to show up in other records."

"Thus, by the mid-1990s it was realized that, around AD 540, there was a global environmental downturn that had affected tree growth in widely separated regions around the world (Baillie 1994, 1995). Moreover, it was almost immediately apparent that the event was two-stage. It appears that the initial effects were in 536 and that these were followed by a second pulse some- where in the window 538–543; thus it became sensible to refer to the ‘540 event’ as something spanning 536–545."

"It transpires that the historical record is un-naturally thin around 540."

"This resulted in a series of dates (e.g. 3195 BC, 2345 BC, 1159 BC, 207 BC, and AD 540) that turned out to be potentially important “marker dates” in human history (Baillie and Munro 1988; Baillie 1995; see also Hammer et al. 1987)."

## Irish tree rings, Santorini and volcanic dust veils - Baillie (hard copy here)

"In theory the narrowest ring width... should be related to the worst growth conditions that the tree experienced during its lifetime."

![](img/irish-tree-rings-baillie.png)

Peaks correspond to narrow ring anomalies. A "narrowness index" formula was constructed which is plotted here, where r is the number of narrowest rings and s the total number of sites within a sliding window.

"We found that the three highest values in the prehistoric period, at 1153 BC, 3199 BC and 4377 BC, corresponded to three of the six major acidity peaks observed during this period in the Camp Century ice core..."

To be honest there's some clustering around the ECDO candidate dates but also just way too many dates for me to feel confident that it's pure cataclysm signal.

## Clam shell analysis - El Nino 3700 year history

![](img/el-nino-3700.jpg)

"The seasonal variation 3700 years ago was slightly lower than that suggested by modern instrumental data, and the transition between warm and cold seasons was rapid. Higher amplitudes of reconstructed r-monthly and r-annual SST anomalies imply an enhanced climate variability during this warm period. Investigation of the El Ninõ–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation (based on the reconstructed SST series) indicates reduced ENSO frequency but increased ENSO-related variability and extreme El Ninõ winter events 3700 years ago."

## The Wallace Line - The Invisible Wildlife Boundary

Alfred Russell Wallace, 1889

During his time in Indonesia, Wallace observed a peculiar division in animal life.

A clear and sudden change in the faunal content of Indonesia's many islands seemed to occur across an invisible border. Through analysis of the distribution of species, both by Wallace and other scientists, a line was drawn that illustrates this divide that splits Indonesia down the middle from north to south. It was named the Wallace Line by Thomas Henry Huxley in honour of its discoverer.

## South America extinction

"It is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the [South] American continent without the deepest astonishment. Formerly it must have swarmed with great monsters now we find mere pigmies, compared with the antecedent allied races. The greater number, if not all, of these extinct quadrupeds lived at a period and were the contemporaries of the existing sea-shells. Since they lived no very great change in the form of the land can have taken place. What, then, has exterminated so many species and whole genera? The mind at first is irresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe; but thus to destroy animals, both large and small, in Southern Patagonia, in Brazil, on the Cordillera of Peru, in North America, and up to Behring Straits, we must shake the entire frame-work of the globe."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin

"It would seem, that one cause destroyed the terrestrial animals of South America, and that this cause is to be found in great dislocations of the ground caused by the upheaval of the Cordilleras. If not, it is difficult to conceive on the one hand the sudden and fortuitous destruction of the great animals which inhabited the American continents, and on the other the vast deposit of Pampan mud. I argue that this destruction was caused by an invasion of the continent by water, a view which is completely en rapport with the facts presented by the great Pampian deposit, which was clearly laid down by water. How otherwise can we account for this complete destruction and the homogeneous nature of the Pampas deposits containing bones?” - Alcide d'Orbigny

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcide_d%27Orbigny

"In South America the pleistocene beds are developed on a very large scale. They cover the great plains of the Argentine Republic, in the form of a modified lehm or loess, to which the name of Pampas mud was given by Darwin and 'formation Pampeene' by D'Orbigny. In other places they exist in the form of beds of gravel and clay, and occasionally as beds of tufa. As in Europe and North America, we also meet with caverns of pleistocene age, many of which have been explored in Brazil by Lund, Clausen, Bravard, and Liais. The distribution of these beds is exceedingly widespread over South America. According to Burmeister, they are richest in organic remains in the province of Buenos Ayres, becoming less rich as we travel westward and northward. Eich deposits of this age have also been found in the Banda Oriental, at various points on the river Parana, and at Borrero in Patagonia. Burmeister says, the diluvial deposit containing bones of animals of this age extends over the whole Brazilian plain, from the flanks of the Cordilleras to the borders of the Atlantic.” They have also been found abundantly in Bolivia, on the great plateau ; and also west of the mountains, both in Peru aiid Chili. From Caracas in the north, to the sierra of I'audel in Pata-gonia in the south, they have, in fact, occurred in more or less abundance over the whole continent. In the great Argentine plain they are found close to the sea-level, while in Bolivia they occur, according to M.Orbigny, at a height of 4000 metres, and they are found with a singular similarity if not uniformity of contents in all latitudes.

That the surface beds of the Pampas and the deposits in the caves were synchronous, is admitted by all explorers. The same creatures are found in both, of course in different proportions, as is the case elsewhere. Nor is there any doubt that both sets of beds date from the same horizon as the Mammoth beds of other countries. The fauna of the pleistocene beds of the Southern States of North America is, in fact, largely identical with that from the beds we are now discussing ; the megatherium and mylodon, the tapir and capybara, the mastodon and horse, &c., &c., being found in both, and every observer, from Darwin to Burmeister, is agreed in assigning them to the same horizon." - The Mammoth and the Flood, Henry Howorth (1887)
