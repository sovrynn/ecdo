## 2400 BCE Climate anomaly - Tree Rings

*"The mid-24th century BCE climate anomaly is the period, between 2354 and 2345 BCE, of consistently reduced annual temperatures that are reconstructed from consecutive abnormally narrow, Irish oak tree rings."*

## Clam shell analysis - El Nino 3700 year history

![](img/el-nino-3700.jpg)

"The seasonal variation 3700 years ago was slightly lower than that suggested by modern instrumental data, and the transition between warm and cold seasons was rapid. Higher amplitudes of reconstructed r-monthly and r-annual SST anomalies imply an enhanced climate variability during this warm period. Investigation of the El Ninõ–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variation (based on the reconstructed SST series) indicates reduced ENSO frequency but increased ENSO-related variability and extreme El Ninõ winter events 3700 years ago."

## The Wallace Line - The Invisible Wildlife Boundary

Alfred Russell Wallace, 1889

During his time in Indonesia, Wallace observed a peculiar division in animal life.

A clear and sudden change in the faunal content of Indonesia's many islands seemed to occur across an invisible border. Through analysis of the distribution of species, both by Wallace and other scientists, a line was drawn that illustrates this divide that splits Indonesia down the middle from north to south. It was named the Wallace Line by Thomas Henry Huxley in honour of its discoverer.
