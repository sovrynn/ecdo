# Mammoths

These things went extinct apparently 4000 years ago, around 2000 BC.

"The last woolly mammoths in mainland Siberia became extinct around 10,000 years ago, during the early Holocene.[50] The final extinction of mainland woolly mammoths may have been driven by human hunting.[49] Relict populations survived on Saint Paul island in the Bering Strait until around 5,600 years ago, with their extinction likely due to the degradation of freshwater sources,[51] and on Wrangel Island off the coast of Northeast Siberia until around 4,000 years ago.[50]" [1]

## Effie: Fairbanks Mammoth 1948, 30,000+ years old

Mining team uncovered the frozen remains of a young mammoth in Fairbanks. Lush vegetation in its mouth showed that the animal died during the growing season in an apparently warm climate.

Secondly the animal had been frozen immediately after death, since its flesh was said to be edible.

So a mammoth foraging in the summertime was almost instantaneously frozen and remained so for 20 millenia.

## Lyuba: 42,000 year old perfectly frozen mammoth

"In 2007, a reindeer herder in Siberia found the body of a baby woolly mammoth that had been washed out from the permafrost along the Yuribei River. Frozen for more than 40,000 years, she was in nearly perfect shape — skin and internal organs intact, taste buds on her tongue, last meal in her stomach."

## Mammoths with genetic mutations 3700 years ago

It's not clear that the mutations suddenly occurred. But comparing these mammoths with much older specimens revealed genetic differences.

"About 3700 years ago, as Mesopotamian poets were composing the "Epic of Gilgamesh," the last woolly mammoths on Earth were making their last stand on a remote Arctic island. A terminal colony persisted on tiny Wrangel Island north of the Siberian mainland thousands of years after the rest of its kind had disappeared. Now, a new study reveals the mammoths' horrific final days: A series of harmful genetic mutations appears to have led to what authors call a "genomic meltdown" in the population."

"Hoping to learn more about the last lonely days of the Wrangel Island mammoths, bioinformatics researcher Rebekah Rogers of the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and biologist Montgomery Slatkin of the University of California (UC), Berkeley, compared the complete DNA sequence from a 4300-year-old mammoth bone found on Wrangel Island with that of a 45,000-year-old specimen that lived on the Siberian mainland."

"It is unlikely that any single mutation doomed the Wrangel mammoths—it still isn't clear exactly what led to their eventual extinction. Rather, their deteriorating genetics would have made it difficult for them to adapt to new social and environmental conditions, Rogers says. Shapiro sees it as a lesson for modern populations that are dwindling and isolated. "By the end, the Wrangel Island mammoths were genetically screwed. Understanding how that happened might help us figure out which species today are most at risk of the same thing happening.""

That was Chan proposed mechanism - flash frozen due to supersonic wind speeds and water due to the rotation.
