6400 year cycle, 6200 in S1, 200 in S2. [2]

*"Taking into account two ECDO S1>S2>S1 events since the pyramids were built means there had to be a third event before they were built in order to observe the 104 degrees of rotation. This had to have happened for the pyramid to have been designed the way it was... In reality though, one experienced event would not be enough to be certain that it was going to happen the same way again. They probably would have had to have experienced two to be certain of the sequence of events."* [4]

Several ancient calendars used an year of six months, however. See `FOUNDATION-THEORY/ecdo-frequency/date-anomalies`.

## Knowth Calendar Stones [3,4]

Could there be a reference to the IV-V planetary harmonic wrapped up in here? I've speculated a possible timeline of events using the 6-volved spiral as the template.

Knowth has another calendar stone (this is is actually known as that).

Adding some detail and visual aids.

They appear in various numbers of turns in many neolithic sites. The number of turns varies, but at Knowth, they mostly seem to favour six turns.

## Pyramid symbolism?

The geometric theme of a pyramid and butterfly vortices seems quite common in ancient art across the world. Top left was not necessarily art though - it's part of a suspected deluge bunker (Newgrange), so I think of it as having been placed there by someone who was a part of the Enochian/Deluge tradition, which seems to arise in many other parts of the world in various forms as well. [4]

## Sabu Disk [4]

"Possibly found another part of the Sabu Disk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabu_disk). These Egyptian "libation bowls" do not look like any other (https://www.google.com/search?q=libation+bowl) such ceremonial devices. The video is of a 3D printed scale replica (the original is 60cm diameter)."

This particular "bowl" has a maximum outer diameter (including the protrusions) of 762mm [1]. From this I estimated an inner diameter of 655mm. The Sabu disk has an OD of 610mm [2], which would leave a clearance of Â±22.5mm between the disk and this particular "housing".

## Pontos coins

PONTOS, under Mithridates VI (120-65 BCE), issued c. 120-100 BCE. 1.30g, 10mm Obv: Head of horse right, with star of eight points on its neck Rev: Comet star of eight points with trail to right. Lovely depiction of a comet on the reverse. It was commonly accepted that both the birth and beginning of the reign of Mithridates VI, the famous enemy of the Roman Republic, were marked by the appearance of brilliant comets. Chinese records actually support the view that there was a supernova in 134 and a comet in 120. It is likely that this coin depicts those important portents; interestingly, the obverse star lacks a tail, in keeping with the supernova hypothesis.

## Corinth Greece coin

Minted in Corinth, Greece, circa 350-338 BCE. This coin almost certainly depicts a comet beneath the Pegasus. Celestia places Halley's comet passing between Sun and Earth early May 349 BC, near to Taurus and Auriga in the sky. Must have been an impressive sight.

## King Hezekiah

I would like to know the significance of this winged aster.

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/jerusalem-king-hezekiah/418431/

I don't think we are getting the whole story.

The reason for my interest is that it seems highly odd for a king of Judah to borrow an image from a foreign deity, for one. 

But, mostly I'm curious because #1 it was during his reign that there was a flury of astronomical records being made in Babylon, they also reset their baseline calendar.

#2 This was the king who recorded the shadow on the steps moving backwards

#3 The "angel" incident that destroyed and turned back the assyrian army from their siege of Jerusalem.

Some theorize this was the time the day length changed to 365.25 from either 364 or 360, and perhaps the moon from 30 to 29.whatever.

All these points in my mind are connecting to theories of the electric universe.

This is why I think it's curious to find this king select this astral image for his royal seal.
