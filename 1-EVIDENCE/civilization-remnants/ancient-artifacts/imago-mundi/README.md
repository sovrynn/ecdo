# Imago Mundi

A 2,700-year-old tablet is the oldest map of the world. 

[Comment: I question that. Unless it's just "Maps Of The Known World". Then maybe that statement is correct. ]

The "Imago Mundi" is the oldest map of the world — as it was known to the Babylonians around 700 BC.

It's carved into a small piece of clay, with annotations explaining it, and the creation myth of the world.

It reveals just how differently the ancients understood the world — but one detail is particularly strange.

It sheds light on a VERY ancient story… [Flood & Ark etc]
