“It really looks like the earth simply opened up and everything on either side of it fell in,” Cline said. “It’s unlikely that the destruction was caused by violent human activity because there are no visible signs of fire, no weapons such as arrows that would indicate a battle, nor any unburied bodies related to combat.”

“You put everything together – no fire, quick collapse, no gradual disintegration of the roof – this is equal to a violent event that caused the collapse and that big crack cutting through the palace in the orientation of the fissure,” says Yasur-Landau. “You don’t need to be Sherlock in order to deduce that this was the result of a geological event."

## Ebla

Ebla. Estimated destruction and final abandonment c.~1600BC. This date could well be erroneous, as it was arrived at by attributing the destruction to the Hittite conquests at that time, with no solid evidence linking the two. Pure speculation. This could easily have fallen around 1700BC.
