“It really looks like the earth simply opened up and everything on either side of it fell in,” Cline said. “It’s unlikely that the destruction was caused by violent human activity because there are no visible signs of fire, no weapons such as arrows that would indicate a battle, nor any unburied bodies related to combat.”

“You put everything together – no fire, quick collapse, no gradual disintegration of the roof – this is equal to a violent event that caused the collapse and that big crack cutting through the palace in the orientation of the fissure,” says Yasur-Landau. “You don’t need to be Sherlock in order to deduce that this was the result of a geological event."

## Ebla

Ebla. Estimated destruction and final abandonment c.~1600BC. This date could well be erroneous, as it was arrived at by attributing the destruction to the Hittite conquests at that time, with no solid evidence linking the two. Pure speculation. This could easily have fallen around 1700BC.

Çatal Hüyük is a tell of a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic proto-city settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 6400 BC and flourished around 7000 BC. Excavation revealed 18 successive layers of buildings signifying various stages of the settlement and eras of history.[1] 

The mystery of this site has to do with its abandonement. Why did the people of Çatal Hüyük suddenly desert their beautiful city in about 5400 BC? So far no one has come up with an answer, even a speculative one. There is no evidence that the Çatal Hüyük were defeated in war or that their city was sacked. It is one of the great puzzles of history. The people of Çatal Hüyük vanished.[2]

In Çatal Hüyük we find another temporal marker for a possible event 7,400 years before present (two 3,700-year (V) planetary harmonic cycles BP).
