# Summary: Detailed Study of the Puerto Rico Tower, Campeche

### Overview
The Puerto Rico Tower in Campeche is a distinctive architectural structure within the Mayan region, characterized by its cylindrical form and intricate design. The tower's original function remains debated, with hypotheses ranging from astronomical or astrological use to symbolic or ceremonial purposes.

### Key Features
- **Design and Structure**:
  - Originally round with a pointed, stepped top resting on a conic base (8.42m diameter, 1.6m height).
  - Current dimensions: elliptical floor plan (2.9m major axis), total height 7.45m, base dimensions 4.32m x 4.54m.
  - Constructed using finely cut stone blocks arranged in the Rio Bec architectural style with reused stones from earlier buildings.
  - Twelve ducts across two levels (average size: 10x14 cm), possibly symbolic or functional as "psychoducts."

- **Historical Interpretations**:
  - George Andrews (1989): Suggested potential astronomical purpose but noted the ducts' alignments didn't match key astronomical markers.
  - Anthony Aveni (2005): Supported the psychoduct hypothesis for ritual or symbolic airflow.
  - Other nearby towers in the Chenes region are related to zenith passages, but no direct correlation is made with the Puerto Rico Tower.

- **Restoration and Conservation**:
  - Underwent a major preservation intervention in 1995 by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, consolidating the damaged structure.
  - Access difficulties have hindered further maintenance, and the tower now shows signs of deterioration.

- **Comparative Context**:
  - Towers in Xpuhil, Rio Bec, and Hormiguero have square forms with rounded corners, used decoratively or as temple representations, contrasting with the cylindrical Puerto Rico Tower.

### Conclusion
The Puerto Rico Tower is an exceptional example of Mayan ingenuity and architectural style. Despite its partially lost original form, it stands as a testament to the advanced construction techniques and cultural significance of the ancient Maya. Continued preservation efforts are crucial for maintaining its historical integrity and furthering its study.

# Summary of Astronomical Alignments and Observations in the Puerto Rico Tower

## Geometric and Astronomical Analysis
- **Structure and Levels**:
  - The tower features two levels, with ducts at elevations of **4.73m** (Level 1) and **7.29m** (Level 2).
  - Each level contains eight perforations (A to H), with four forming two parallel passing ducts:
    - Level 1: A-D and E-H.
    - Level 2: B-G and C-F.
  - Non-passing ducts intersect the main ducts.

- **Projection onto the Celestial Vault**:
  - Images of the ducts were projected to determine observable portions of the sky.
  - Overlapping the projections highlighted areas of the vault where the trajectories of the Sun and Moon are visible through the ducts.

## Observations by Levels
### Level 1
- **Passing Ducts (A-D and E-H)**:
  - No significant Sun or Moon rising/setting phenomena observed.
- **Non-Passing Ducts (C and G)**:
  - No relevant alignment with celestial phenomena.
- **Key Alignments (B and F)**:
  - Almost perfect east-west alignment.
  - Matches solar rising and setting during the **equinoxes**.
  - Lack of duct continuity limits direct astronomical observations, though sunlight entry is possible, particularly for ducts A-D and E-H.

### Level 2
- **Passing Ducts (B-G and C-F)**:
  - Nearly perpendicular to Level 1 ducts.
  - Significant astronomical alignments observed:
    - **C-F**:
      - Marks the winter solstice sunrise point (C).
      - Marks the summer solstice sunset point (F).
    - **B-G**:
      - Slightly westward deviation aligns with the sunset during zenithal passage days.

- **Other Ducts**:
  - No significant astronomical alignments identified.

## Additional Observations
- Images demonstrate relationships between settlements (e.g., Puerto Rico and Buenos Aires) using GIS for Mayan ruins.
- Visualization techniques confirmed the potential for limited celestial observations through duct alignments.
