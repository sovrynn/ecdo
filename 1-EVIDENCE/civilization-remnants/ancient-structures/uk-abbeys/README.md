## Kirkstall Abbey

Kirkstall Abbey. I'm still convinced these Abbey ruins are older than we are led to believe. I will keep digging...

I believe these Abbeys were built BC and were destroyed in the 6th century event.

Look carefully at this early 18th century etching of the Abbey. It was inundated at some point and I think they were overgrown for a long time.

Mainstream history tells us these Abbeys were built over 30 years in the 1100s on marshy ground no one wanted. They chose 30 years for the construction time for the pyramids as well of course.

These things took hundreds of years to build is my point.

Firstly they appear on a 1610 map I have on the wall at home

Secondly they don't appear in William the conquerors 11th century domesday book...

What is notable by these records is how few people were living in these rural areas back then. The land was pretty much deserted.

And this largely remained the same for hundreds of years
