# Skara Brae

A broken string of beads was found scattered along a passageway floor. This was one of the discoveries at Skara Brae.[1] Very strong evidence of a hurried abandonment. The current narrative of the site's burial:

“The site appears to have been abandoned around 2500 BCE. There is evidence that Skara Brae was partially buried by sand and sediment soon after it was deserted. This process may have begun due to a combination of environmental factors, such as storms, shifting sands, and rising sea levels. Over time, the uninhabited structures were gradually covered by wind-blown sand.”[2]

Anyone familiar with the weather conditions in the Orkneys will perhaps see the nonsense in this "wind-blown sand" deposition theory. If anything, nature does everything in its power to strip the land bare in the Orkney's, as it did to reveal Skara Brae in the first place. "In February 1850, a violent storm ravaged the coast of Orkney with strong winds and high waves. The storm tore away the turf from a knoll on Watt’s property and exposed a cluster of prehistoric dwellings, laid bare for Watt to see as he inspected his property for storm damage."[3]

Orkney is known for being one of the windiest places in the UK, with frequent strong winds, especially in autumn and winter. Wind speeds can regularly exceed 50-60 km/h (31-37 mph), with storms sometimes bringing gusts over 100 km/h (62 mph). The wind significantly impacts the landscape and life on the islands.[4]

Trench stratigraphy from Skara Brae. The lower section shows the remnants of an earlier structure (first phase occupation). This place appears to have been wiped out twice. I find it interesting that many of the stones were apparently relocated and suspended in the "wind-blown sand" (blue arrows) and there are layers of midden (human debris sediment) on top of layers of the "wind-blown" deposits, also with stones suspended in them (orange arrows).

"Apartment seven at Skara Brae was not only unusual in having a door which locked from the outside, it was also the only one with a large stone block in the living area, and beneath one of the beds the bodies of two adult females had been buried. The intact skeletons showed signs of having been interred before the building had been erected, and the bed under which they had been inhumed was the only one in the village to be inscribed – or perhaps labelled. 

Apartments seven and eight both seem to be special as they are the only buildings to be embellished by carved patterns on their stonework." - Uriel's Machine

## Dwarfie Stone

The Dwarfie Stone. Orkney. “One extraordinary monument, the Dwarfie Stane, has attracted the attention of visitors and the speculation of antiquaries since the sixteenth century, and indeed its classification as a chambered tomb is periodically questioned.” Measuring around 8.5 metres long, the roughly rectangular stone is c. 4.47 metres wide at the southern end, tapering to c. 3.96 metres at the north.

Lying at a slight angle, the height varies from around two metres (south) to c. 0.91m (north).

An opening, 91cm square, cut into the west face leads to a chamber hewn from the solid rock using stone tools, muscle and patience. Measuring just 76cm high, this chamber is divided into three parts – a central “passage” flanked by recessed cells.

## Sand profile

The sand which buried many Orkney sites, and which constitutes the sand dunes on the islands, is calcium carbonate. Anyone wish to hazard a guess where such sand originates? Sea shells and coral reefs. Just how many tons of sea sand, I wonder, crawled out of the ocean and are now lying on top of the islands?

![](img/orkney-sand.jpg)

I asked GPT to estimate how much carbonate sand lies above sea level across the Orkney Islands. Even at the low end, this seems like an enormous volume of sand to have originated from where, if not from beneath the waves?
