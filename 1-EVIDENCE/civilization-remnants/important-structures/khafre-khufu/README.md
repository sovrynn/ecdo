# Khafre and Khufu Pyramids

Arguably the centerpoints of TES's ECDO theory. Many of his comments cited below.

Great Pyramid of Giza refers to the Khufu pyramid, which has the shafts. Khafre pyramid is the one with the erosion line.

### Khufu Pyramid Function - Tripartite Observatory [1]

This pyramid is hypothesized by TES to be a tripartite observatory designed to monitor the ECDO.

![](img/khufu-tri.webp)

*"King’s Chamber – Celestial Pole Nutation Monitoring: The north celestial pole monitoring shafts are oriented to a specific celestial reference, running directly to the pyramid’s surface and pointing accurately at both Np (State 1) and Np‘ (State 2) for Giza. These shafts are designed to monitor the nutation (wobble and wander) of the celestial north pole..."*

*"Queen’s Chamber – Geomagnetic Moment and Ionospheric Monitoring: Geomagnetic moment/flux field orientation monitoring – by means of copper cable pairs (seen in Exhibit M), that were allegedly confiscated in part by former Egyptian Antiquities Minister, Zahi Hawass.48 49 These copper cables were contained inside shafts that do not run completely to the exterior of the pyramid, are capped off (neither for ‘air’ nor ‘stars’), and are oriented to the pyramid structure itself. The limestone blocks of the pyramid served as a natural isolation mechanism, insulating the copper cables and shielding them from extraneous electromagnetic interference, while simultaneously allowing transparency to the critical Earth geomagnetic frequencies essential to the mission. The 90-degree relative angle to the pyramid’s sky-facing sides (no accident – annotated as the right angle in Exhibit K) might have been designed to focus and channel electromagnetic resonances, enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of the geomagnetic monitoring system in the Queen’s Chamber."*

*"Remnants of the copper cables (click on photo to right) were found by the Gantenbrink Upuaut Project in March 1990 in the Queen’s Chamber south air shaft (and later the North Shaft as well). These cables have long since been removed by both tomb robbers, as evidenced by the Dixon Relics found by Waynman Dixon at the bottom of the north shaft in 1872, and by obfuscation (alleged) on the part of Zahi Hawass."*

*"Subterranean Chamber – H-Layer P-Wave Infrasound Monitoring: Deep-earth seismometry/core-mantle H-layer/LLVP dynamics monitoring fluid-based sensor. In similar effect to the geomagnetic monitoring, the pyramid’s structure could have been optimized to both isolate and focus seismic signals towards the Subterranean Chamber, allowing it to effectively monitor seismic activity and internal Earth dynamics free of noise from surface, device, or other nearby activity. The chamber itself would use water to detect the infrasound frequencies involved."*

*"Moreover, there is an independent determination that the rock-cut dead-end south passage inside the chamber might well have functioned as a sound resonance tube, generating or receiving infrasound with a base frequency in the range of 5 and 10 Hz – and that constant low frequency noise can be heard/sensed in the chamber.59 60 This corresponds well to the design of the pyramid itself – which is wavelength optimized to 5 Hz, per Exhibit K3 below."*

### Khufu dual-orientation authentication mechanism [1]

*"More importantly, the two angles defined by these sets of shafts (King and Queen’s shaft sets), match an alignment to the Dzhanibekov rotation as viewed from the the two critical locations defined in Exhibit H2: The Giza Plateau and the Geographic Center of the World... What the duplication in shafts and offset chambers serve to communicate, is an authentication of the change in celestial north pole location, during two different time periods. An intelligence which cannot be communicated by a single set of shafts, nor certainly by shaft combinations which do not agree."*

### Khufu construction timeframe - 9600 to 9200 BC [1]

*"In one of the star/air shafts extending upward from the Queen’s Chamber, there resides a curious set of non-hieroglyphic markings which were photograped by the Upuaut Project.66 On the ceiling, just at the final stone before the block that terminates this shaft, a depiction of the night sky is carved. This artistic representation includes the constellations Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, Draco, Lacerta, Bootes, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, unmistakably identifying this specific section of the sky and its orientation."*

*"This depiction suggests a construction timeframe for the star shaft of around 9200 to 9600 BCE, as evidenced by comparing Exhibits M and N. Many of the stars represented in this carving would have been below the horizon in 2540 BCE and thus invisible in this depiction, to observers of that era. A Starry NightTM rendering of the northern sky at Giza as it appeared in 9200 BCE, which precisely matches the arrangement carved into the stone shown in Exhibit M, is shown below, along with the sextant-like alignment technique entailed."*

We also have local kiln-fired mortar dating from 4000 to 2300 BC: "1995 Lehner Study: This larger and more comprehensive study included 64 samples, with dates ranging from approximately 4000 to 2300 BCE. The wide range reflects the variability in the materials and the complex history of construction and use of the site." [1]

And tomb robber tool dating to ~3200 BC: "Carbon dating conducted on these pieces in 1995, and finally confirmed in 2020, places the wood 650-900 years (3341-3094 BCE) before the Fourth Dynasty of Pharaoh Khufu." [1]

### Khafre erosion [1]

"I don't know how to make this clearer: Any story regarding the construction/dating of Khufu and Khafre must definitively address this karst erosion feature—otherwise, it is not a scientific hypothesis, rather narrative dogma." - Ethical Skeptic

## Dislodged Bricks

Observation: The most likely thing that could have dislodged, chipped and broken these casing stones in such a distributed and random fashion is a brute of an earthquake. [2]

## Why were these built on flood locations if they were built by civilizations that survived an ECDO? [2]

Think about other suitable locations on that meridian which would have worked, providing destabilization monitoring for both states. Is there anywhere suitable? It survived intact where it is. Its the only one of the pyramids founded on the bedrock there. Seems like it was built to endure. Perhaps the elevated upper entrance was intended as a docking point for boats.

![](img/khufu-hole1.jpg)

I'm pondering whether the interior lower levels were constructed in such a way as to eliminate water downwards. If they built it to be inundated, then that would very likely have been carried through to the inner design.

![](img/khufu-hole2.jpg)

In order for the observatory to serve its ECDO-proposed purpose, it had to be both functional and accessible during the latter part of State 2 (the upper chamber at least). Any seawater ingress during the initial inundation would have to be drained out somehow. Built to purpose?

The corbel roof above the upper chamber in the pyramid bears an architectural resemblance to that seen in Newgrange. In the latter case the design was employed to channel water away from the space below, keeping it dry for centuries.

Apparently archaelogists used to support this hypothesis, but when exactly the mood changed I cannot discern.

## Khufu - Stirling Generator?

Evolution of the Stirling Engine. Ultrasonic waves are generated through the application of heat to a thermoacoustic material. The resonant wavefront drives a piston or vibrates a tellurically active material (possibly quartz) in a resonant chamber. The vibration generates electricity. This is similar to the principal behind the formation of "earthquake lights". With few or no moving parts, these run silently. Any heat source may be used with most designs. They are highly scalable, require little or no maintenance and will run reliably for decades. China's working design produces 102 kilowatts of power from a temperature gradient of 530 degrees Celsius [1]. NASA have been working on a couple of similar projects (at the patent tender stage).[2][3]

## Number of inundations [2]

Khufu (and the valley of the kings complex) were not built by the Egyptians. They were found by them and repurposed (and copied many times in the case of the pyramid). Two ECDO events would have had to have been previously recorded to built the great pyramid. They couldn’t have known that it was cyclic otherwise. So this means at least two before Khufu was built and at least two afterwards according to the Egyptian records. “Many times in the past 9,000 years” we’re Plato’s words. Four.

## Scaling dimensions?

## 1200 AD account

Interestingly (I think) the mainstream history talks about Abd al-Latif a 12th century historian writing that the stones of the pyramids were covered in indeciverable writing which is taken to assume that the casing stones were all still in place during his visit around 1200 AD. This is a problem so I did a little digging and came across the article below with a couple of interesting paragraphs...

https://humancircuspodcast.com/podcastscripts/2022/5/24/abd-al-latif-al-baghdadi-3-harvesting-the-past

Firstly this extract from his account. Unless this local was spiderman he wouldn't have been able to run up Khufu's pristine casing stones in his sandals

"He then heard that there were locals who routinely climbed to the top, something that he was clearly not prepared to do. Such a man was sent for, paid, and to the spectators’ amazement, went up as one might climb a staircase, “even more swiftly,” in sandals and a long, trailing robe. As instructed, the climber measured out the flat top with his turban and then recreated the dimensions with it on the ground."

The paragraph below deals with the writings that people claim he wrote were on the pyramids at Giza but it refers to Ain Shams nowhere near Giza. 

That was not all that Abd al-Latif saw that remained mysterious to him. At Ain Shams, in the stone of the pyramids, and on buildings and monuments around them, he saw inscriptions in ancient writing which he did not understand, “engraved representations of humans and other living beings, and many inscriptions in the unknown characters; you seldom see a stone that is blank,” he wrote, “without either an inscription or some other engraving or image on it.”

He then blames an Arab for the removal of the casimg stones which he ridiculously claims were knocked off the 3 pyramids over the course of the year and as they hit the sand became buried and had to be dug out to be processed. You decide if you want to believe this nonsense. I'm inclined to believe they were washed off before being buried in sand and later excavated by the Arabs. 

"This time, it was Salah-ad Din’s son Al-Malik Al-Aziz Uthman who was responsible, for his choice of friends if nothing else, for listening to his more foolish ones, Abd al-Latif says. At their urging, he sent forth an army of emirs, administrators, miners, workers, and artificers, along with soldiers on horse and foot, all following his order to destroy the three great pyramids.

In 1196-97, this army laboured for 8 months at their assigned task. They exhausted themselves both physically and mentally, striving until their resolve was in tatters, but what did they have to show for it? They would take the entirety of the day to bring loose one or two massive stones, and as each one tumbled with a great crash, it would bury itself in the sand, needing them to exert themselves to bring it loose again and then, with driven wedges, to break it down enough to be brought away.

They moved enough stone in this way that you would think it enough for the entire pyramid to be gone, but instead, Abd al-Latif wrote, “the only goal they attained was that of disfiguring the pyramid and exposing their own impotence and incompetence.” As for the damage they had managed, when Abd-al Latif asked a foreman of the stonemasons if he could ever manage to replace one of those huge stones were he given 1,000 dinars to do so, the man replied that he could never manage the repairs, even if paid many times more. That damage was done. Those stones were never going back. That pyramid would never again be quite as it was."

Had these lesser stone columns actually been broken up and moved to the shore as military or sea defence or had they been washed there by a deluge? You decide.

"There was the immense Pillar of Columns at Alexandria, once, the Alexandrians he talked to agreed, surrounded by hundreds of lesser pillars of the same stone, but they had been broken and thrown down at the shore by a certain governor. To protect against forceful waves, he had claimed, or against the mooring of forceful visitors, but for Abd al-Latif it was, quote, “really an act of wanton and puerile vandalism, and the deed of someone who cannot distinguish between what is useful and what is harmful.” It is of course possible that it was both of those things, and the threat of hostile ships, perhaps crusading ones, was hardly an empty fear."

Anyone know what the green chamber is he refers to?

"So it was also with a place known as the Green Chamber, a room cut from one block of stone within a great temple and covered within and without by engravings. On the outside, you find a sun, turned toward the sun rising over the horizon, along with stars and human and animal figures. Abd al-Latif saw these as not merely ornamental but allegorical for higher, nobler matters, signs indicating esoteric truths."
