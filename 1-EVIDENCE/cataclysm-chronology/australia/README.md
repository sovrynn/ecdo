# Australia Cataclysm Myths

## Heat so intense a man kills his family and himself

From Tollmann's work (7400 BC bolide hypothesis): "Wildfire is also recorded as blowing the great rivers out of their beds, as the oral histories of the Indians of California and the traditions in the Near East around the Euphrates record. The Aborigines in southern Australia gave an account of the horrible heat descending from a red-hot sky. The heat was so extreme that people could not endure it, and the men killed their children and wives, and finally themselves (Walk, 1931, p. 76)." https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/tree/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/tollmann
