## Genetic origins

Interesting. Some Native American mtDNA haplogroups (e.g., A, B, C, D, and X) trace back to populations that migrated from Asia over 15,000 years ago. https://grahamhancock.com/davidga5/

Frank Waters suggested that the Hopi ancestry may extend back at least twenty to thirty thousand years, and that they are direct descendants of the survivors of the last world. He goes on to suggest that the clans which lost sight of their spiritual journey were those that built the great megalithic civilizations, and pyramids. The North American Hopi of today may be the only remaining culture on Earth which has continued to follow the original teachings brought from the last world.

## End of the First World

Hopi description of the fire that ended the First World: "Sotuknang destroyed it by fire because the Fire Clan had been its leaders. He rained fire upon it. He opened up the volcanoes. Fire came from above and below and all around until the earth, the waters, the air, all was one element, fire, and there was nothing left except the people safe inside the womb of the earth." from Book of the Hopi by Frank Waters

## Prophecy

"We were told of three helpers who were commissioned by the Great Spirit to help Hopi bring about the peaceful life on earth would appear to help us and we should not change our homes, our ceremonials, our hair, because the true helpers might not recognize us as the true Hopi. 

So we have been waiting all these years. It is known that our True White Brother, when he comes, will be all powerful and will wear a red cap or red cloak. He will be large in population, belong to no religion but his very own. He will bring with him the sacred stone tablets.With him there will be two great ones both very wise and powerful. 

One will have a symbol or sign of swastika which represents purity and is Female, a producer of life. 

The third one or the second one of the two helpers to our True White Brother will have a sign of a symbol of the sun. He, too, will be many people and very wise and powerful." 

- Chief Dan Evehema.
