Filter out one date from this line in YBP format. The line will have a date in format of BC or AD, typically at the start or near the start of the line. It might have a date range - if so, take the midpoint of it. If there's no date, just RETURN -1. Then return the date in YBP, and LITERALLY nothing else, just a number. NO GRAMMAR OR FORMATTING. Number only
