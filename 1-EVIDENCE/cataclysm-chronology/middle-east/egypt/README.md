# Egypt

Egypt has a long string of history. There are plenty of archaelogical remains from very long ago, before the Younger Dryas.

"The period from 9000 to 6000 BC has left very little in the way of archaeological evidence. Around 6200 BC, Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt." [3]

"At the end of prehistory, "Predynastic Egypt" is traditionally defined as the period from the final part of the Neolithic period beginning c. 6200 BC to the end of the Naqada III period c. 3000 BC." [3]

The vast majority of Predynastic archaeological finds have been in Upper Egypt, because the silt of the Nile River was more heavily deposited at the Delta region, completely burying most Delta sites long before modern times. [3]

So, Upper Egypt, right in the path of the Mediterranean, was able to preserve its artifacts in flood sediment? Not clear.

Then it goes from First Dynasty to Second Dynasty and so on, until the 32nd Dynasty, when it was conquered by Rome around 30 BCE.

## Velikovsky

While Egypt's cataclysm accounts are scant, Velikovsky managed to scrounge up some very tough-to-find cataclysm accounts. See the beginning of chapter 5 of WIC.

## Second Dynasty - 3000 BC event?

"The Second Dynasty of ancient Egypt (or Dynasty II, c. 2890 – c. 2686 BC[1]) is the latter of the two dynasties of the Egyptian Archaic Period, when the seat of government was centred at Thinis. It is most known for its last ruler, Khasekhemwy, but is otherwise one of the most obscure periods in Egyptian history." [1]

"Nynetjer (also known as Ninetjer and Banetjer) is the Horus name of the third pharaoh of the Second Dynasty of Egypt during the Early Dynastic Period. Archaeologically, Nynetjer is the best attested king of the entire dynasty. Direct evidence shows that he succeeded Raneb on the throne. What happened after him is much less clear as historical sources and archaeological evidences point to some breakdown or partition of the state. Nynetjer's reign is difficult to date precisely, with most experts proposing that he flourished some time during the late 29th century BC to the early 27th century BC." [2]

## Seventh Dynasty - 2200 BC event?

The Seventh Dynasty of Egypt would mark the beginning of the First Intermediate Period in the early 22nd century BC but its actual existence is debated. The only historical account on the Seventh Dynasty was in Manetho's Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC, where the Seventh Dynasty appears essentially as a metaphor for chaos. Since next to nothing is known of this dynasty beyond Manetho's account, Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Toby Wilkinson have usually considered it to be fictitious. [4]

## Eighth Dynasty ca. 2181 BC–ca. 2160 BC

The Eighth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (Dynasty VIII) is a poorly known and short-lived line of pharaohs reigning in rapid succession in the early 22nd century BC, likely with their seat of power in Memphis. [5]

## Ninth Dynasty c. 2160 BC–c. 2130 BC

The dynasty that seems to have supplanted the Eighth Dynasty is extremely obscure. The takeover by the rulers of Herakleopolis was violent and is reflected in Manetho's description of Achthoes, the founder of the dynasty, as 'more terrible than his predecessors', who 'wrought evil things for those in all Egypt". [6]

## 13th Dynasty 1803 BC–1649 BC [7,8]

However, the dynasty marked a period of decline and instability, with Dynasty XIV rising concurrently and the Hyksos Dynasty XV taking control shortly after.

In later texts, this dynasty is usually described as an era of chaos and disorder.

Merneferre Ay (1701–1677 BC or 1714–1691 BC) .. Reigned 23 years, the longest reign of the dynasty. Last king to be attested in both Lower and Upper Egypt... Following these kings, the remaining rulers of the 13th Dynasty are only attested by finds from Upper Egypt. This may indicate the abandonment of the old capital Itjtawy in favor of Thebes.[9] Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers. For some authors, this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period.

Merneferre Ay is the last pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty to be attested outside Upper Egypt. In spite of his long reign, the number of artefacts attributable to him is comparatively small. This may point to problems in Egypt at the time and indeed, by the end of his reign, "the administration [of the Egyptian state] seems to have completely collapsed".[1][3] It is possible that the capital of Egypt since the early Middle Kingdom, Itjtawy was abandoned during or shortly after Ay's reign. For this reason, some scholars consider Merneferre Ay to be the last pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
