## Overview

"The Book of Enoch is one of the most important of the apocalyptic works, dating from the period of the Second Temple. 

The Second Temple period or post-exilic period in Jewish history denotes the approximately 600 years (516 BCE - 70 CE) during which the Second Temple stood in the city of Jerusalem.

Jesus Christ predicted the destruction of the Second Temple in Luke 21:5-38 and it was destroyed in 70 AD.

The book is named after the biblical Enoch, son of Jared, about whom it is stated in Genesis 5:24 that he "walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him," which was understood to mean that he ascended to heaven during his lifetime.

This link is to the 1906 Ethiopic version by Robert Henry Charles.  Edited from Twenty-Three MSS. Together with the Fragmentary Greek and Latin Versions.

Robert Henry Charles, an eminent British theologian and scholar, was instrumental in bringing the Book of Enoch to the English-speaking world.    Born in 1855, Charles was a leading figure in the study of ancient religious texts and textual criticism. His meticulous translation of the Book of Enoch in 1893 remains a seminal work, providing valuable insights into the apocryphal books and pseudepigrapha."  He's buried in Westminster Abbey.

## Quote

"Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, said to me: At the time, when the ministering angels sing (the Thrice) Holy, then all the pillars of the heavens and their sockets shake, and the gates of the Halls of Araboth (the highest heaven) of Raqia (heaven) are shaken and the foundations of Shechaqim and the universe are moved, and the orders (secrets) of Maon and the chambers of Makon quiver, and all the orders of Raqia (heaven) and the constellations and the planets are distressed. The orbs of the sun and the moon rush away and run out of their pattens and run 12,000 parasangs and the wish to throw themselves down from heaven, because of the roaring voice (sound) of their song, and the noise of their praise and the sparks and lightning that proceed from their faces."

METATRON *spoken with a booming voice* - probably the coolest name ever in ancient literature ðŸ˜‰

Metatron, Melchizedek, and Michael are the 3 M's that mysticism likes to discuss.

I'm not quite sure what to do with 3 Enoch, it seems to be at the earliest a 2nd century text from the falls in the realm of rabbinical jewish mysticism.  Probably composed during the same period as the assembly of the Mishnah.

It has some crazy imagery going on, that's for sure.
