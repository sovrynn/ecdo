## Dating (1800 - 1400 BC)

This biblical chronology places Exodus anywhere from 1600 - 1400 BC: https://biblicalhistoricalcontext.com/exodus/the-biblical-dates-of-the-exodus/

Exodus is dated through temporal dependency of ~480 years to the building of the temple of Solomon, which seems well dated to around 950 BC. It's also dated by Joshua's conquest of Canaan.

Africanus dated Ogyges as a contemporary of Moses and the Exodus, and he dated Ogyges to 1800 BC. See Europe flood myths.

Exodus seems to be placed about 900 - 1100 years after Noah's Flood. See the folder about Noah's flood.

The hypothesized dates of Solomon's reign are from 970 to 931 BCE." [2]

### The United Kingdom of Israel [3]
