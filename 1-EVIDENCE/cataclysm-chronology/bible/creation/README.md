## Adam and Eve Flood

The opening verses of the bible begin with:

"1) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2) Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters."

The second verse may refer to a cataclysm flood event.

## The Beginnings of Christian Universal History From Tatian to Julius Africanus (hard copy here)

Good writeup. Not solely about Africanus (evidently from the title).

"When one speaks of Christian historiography in antiquity, the first thing that usually comes to mind is “Church history” in general and Eusebius’ great achievement in this field in particular. Eusebius is called “the father of Church history”, and quite rightly so1. However, one tends to forget the fact that this new literary genre was not an immediate success story."

"Christian chronography also originated in antiquity, and the honorary epithet “father of Christian chronography” has been given to Julius Africanus (third century), whose Chronographiae (or what survives of it) are now accessible in a new critical edition3."

"What we have, are a few fragments of his cronograf...ai, originally a voluminous work consisting of five books, written in 221."

## Eusebius

"The problem with this theory is that Eusebius starts, not with creation, but with the birth of Abraham—at a point when the world was already, according to his reckoning, 3,184 years old. Another approach focuses on Eusebius’s revision of the received Christian chronology of Sextus Julius Africanus. Whereas Sextus had placed Christ’s death in the 5,500th year of world, Eusebius’s chronology implied that Christ was born in its 5,199th year." [1]

## Saturn Theory

Could the biblical creation story actually refer to Saturn creating Adam (Mars) and subsequently Venus (Eve) and Earth. The old "men are from Mars women are from Venus" trope! These planets were held in a string of birkeland currents as described in the Saturn Death Cult. When this system was torn apart when it encountered the solar system could it be that the 200 nephilim men who descended to earth and procreated with the indigenous human population as described in the bible and the book of Enoch were escaping Mars as its atmosphere collapsed? Just re-reading Genesis I note that during the creation God creates all the creatures and man, male and female in "our" image on the 6th day. But in chapter 2 it's stated that there is no life on earth as God has not caused it to rain yet. So where was all this other life he had created? The "earth" of Mars? Was this then transferred to our Earth/Eden as a paradise but was then raided by the nephilim which were the man created earlier in chapter 1. Was the punishment for this transgression the destruction of the Saturn planetary system and a life of toil and cataclysms orbiting the sun?

## word sleuthing

I think there is a modern misunderstanding of the famous Gen 1:1 passage:

"According to most theologians, the word “create” is understood to mean “to make something out of nothing.” This definition is an abstract concept with no concrete foundation and therefore could not have been a Hebraic concept.
 [...] 
If the word bara does not mean "create" then what does it mean? By examining other passages where this word appears, we can begin to uncover its true meaning. In 1 Samuel 2:29 this same verb is translated as “make yourselves fat,” so this word will have something do with “fattening.”
