## Talkorigins excerpt

An uncommonly specific description of cataclysmic geological process: "The king of the water demons fell in love with the woman Ngai-ti (Loved One). She rejected him and ran away. He pursued and surrounded the whole human race with water on the hill Phun-lu-buk, said to be in the far northeast. Threatened by waters which continued to rise, the people threw Ngai-ti into the flood, which then receded. **The receding water carved great valleys**; until then, the earth had been level." [Gaster, p. 97]

## Maori (New Zealand Islands)

"He called to Raki to overturn the earth, and he struck the earth, with his knife (inaipi), and the earth turned upside down, and all the people of the world perished. Puta and his people alone were saved. Thenceforth this has been rehearsed as the overturning of Mata-eho by Puta."

"They thought that some of the people of the world might perhaps still he alive, and that the earth might have the same appearance as it had before the flood came; but on landing they saw that there was not one human being left alive, and the land had materially changed : it had cracked in parts, had been turned upside down, and had been confused by the power of the flood; and they found that they were the only survivors oÂ£ all the tribes of all the earth, and that the earth had completely changed in appearance." (sounds like the account of an observer).
