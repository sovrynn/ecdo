# Cataclysm Chronology

This folder is for compiling a proper chronology of all cataclysms, incorporating myths, stories, and accounts of floods and cataclysms together with history.

## Potential Cataclysm Dates

- 400 BC, Alexander the great
- 1200 BC, Late Minoan 2, Egypt
- 2200 - 1700 BC, most events
- 3200 - 2800 BC, many events
- 6200 - 5500 BC, black sea deluge dating
- 9600 BC, end of younger dryas

I just haven't found enough accounts of very serious floods or changing cosmic trajectories during the 400 BC and 1200 BC dates to place much stock in them. These could be regional quakes or comet strikes.

## Timeline of dateable myths

400 BC: Alexander the Great Turkey deluge myth

~1700 BC event:
- Greek flood (Deucalion, Ogyges, Dardanus): 1800 - 1528 BC
	- There seems to be contention (Velikovsky) on whether Ogyges or Deucalion is a contemporary of Moses. What seems to be common is that Ogyges is oft cited as being earlier than Deucalion by a few 100 years
- Crete Minoan Civilization, Close of Middle Minoan II: 1700 BC
- Mohenjo-Daro abandonment: 1700 BC
- China Gun-Yu Flood contemporary with Ogyges and Korea Dangun: ~2000 BC
- Peruvian Timeline: ~1800 BC "heavenly fire"

## Talkorigins excerpt

An uncommonly specific description of cataclysmic geological process: "The king of the water demons fell in love with the woman Ngai-ti (Loved One). She rejected him and ran away. He pursued and surrounded the whole human race with water on the hill Phun-lu-buk, said to be in the far northeast. Threatened by waters which continued to rise, the people threw Ngai-ti into the flood, which then receded. **The receding water carved great valleys**; until then, the earth had been level." [Gaster, p. 97]

## Kutenai North Star
