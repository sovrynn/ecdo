# Wind Stories [1]

Wind Stories. "The Manuscript Troano [2] and other documents of the Mayas describe a cosmic catastrophe during which the ocean fell on the continent, and a terrible hurricane swept the Earth. The hurricane broke up and carried away all towns and forests. Exploding volcanoes, tides sweeping over mountains, and impetuous winds threatened to annihilate humankind and actually did annihilate many species of animals. The face of the Earth changed—mountains collapsed, other mountains grew and rose over the onrushing cataract of water driven from oceanic spaces, numberless rivers lost their beds, and a wild tornado moved through the debris descending from the sky.

"The end of the world age was caused by Hurakan, the physical agent that brought darkness and swept away houses, trees, and even rocks and mounds of earth. From this name is derived "hurricane," the word we use for a strong wind. Hurakan destroyed the major part of the human race. In the darkness swept by wind, resinous material fell from the sky and participated with fire and water in the destruction of the world. For five days, save for the burning naphtha and burning volcanoes, the world was dark, since the sun did not appear.

The theme of a cosmic hurricane is reiterated time and again in the Hindu Vedas and in the Persian Avesta, and "diluvium venti," the deluge of wind, is a term known from many ancient authors. In the section The Darkness, rabbinical sources describe an "exceedingly strong west wind" that endured for seven days when the land was enveloped in darkness. A hieroglyphic inscription from El-Arish refers to "nine days of upheaval" when "there was such a tempest" that nobody could leave the palace or see the faces of those beside him. Similarly, the eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh recounts that "six days and a night... the hurricane, deluge, and tempest continued sweeping the land," leading to the near-total destruction of humankind. In the battle of the planet-god Marduk with Tiamat, "he [Marduk] created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane, and the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the wind which had no equal."

The Maoris narrate that amid a stupendous catastrophe, "the mighty winds, the fierce squalls, the clouds—dense, dark, fiery, wildly drifting, wildly bursting"—rushed upon creation. In their midst was Tawhiri-ma-tea, father of winds and storms, who swept away giant forests and lashed the waters into billows whose crests rose high like mountains. The Earth groaned terribly, and the ocean fled.

"The Earth was submerged in the ocean but was drawn by Tefaafanau," relate the aborigines of Paumotu in Polynesia. The new isles "were bated by a star." In the month of March, the Polynesians celebrate a god, Taafanua. In Arabic, Tyfoon is a whirlwind, and Tufan is the Deluge; the same word appears in Chinese as Ty-fong. It seems as though the noise of the hurricane was overtoned by a sound not unlike the name Typhon, as if the storm itself were calling him by name.

The cosmic upheaval proceeded with a "mighty strong west wind," but before the climax, in the simple words of the Scriptures, "the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided." The Israelites were on the shore of the Sea of Passage at the climax of the cataclysm. 

The inscription on a shrine found in El-Arish may provide some indication of where Pharaoh was engulfed by the whirlpool. In any event, the topographical distribution of sea and land did not remain the same after the cataclysm of the days of the Exodus. The name Jam Suf is not derived from "reed" but from suf or sufa, meaning "hurricane" in Hebrew. In Egyptian, the Red Sea is called shari, which signifies the "sea of percussion" (mare percussionis), or the "sea of the stroke" or "of the disaster." The Haggadah of Passover states: "Thou didst sweep the land of Moph and Noph... on the Passover."

The hurricane that ended the Middle Kingdom in Egypt—"the blast of heavenly displeasure" in the language of Manetho—swept through every corner of the world. To distinguish this diluvium venti of cosmic proportions from local disastrous storms, one must also find accompanying cosmic disturbances such as the disappearance of the sun or changes in the sky.

In Japanese cosmogonical myth, the sun goddess hid herself for a long time in a heavenly cave in fear of the storm god. "The source of light disappeared, the whole world became dark," and the storm god caused monstrous destruction. The gods made terrible noise to coax the sun back into the sky, and from their tumult, the Earth quaked. In Japan and across the vast ocean, hurricanes and earthquakes are common, but they do not disturb the day-night succession nor cause permanent changes in the sky.

"The sky was low," relate the Polynesians of Takaofo Island, "then the winds and waterspouts and the hurricanes came and carried up the sky to its present height."

A Buddhist text on World Cycles describes how, when a world cycle is destroyed by wind, "the wind also turns the ground upside down and throws it into the sky." Areas of one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, and even five hundred leagues in extent crack and are hurled upward by the force of the wind. These fragments do not fall back but are "blown to powder in the sky and annihilated." The wind also lifts the mountains encircling the Earth, grinding them to dust and destroying them. The cosmic wind blows and destroys "a hundred thousand times ten million worlds."

“When a world cycle is destroyed by wind ... there arises in the beginning a cycle-destroying great cloud.... There arises a wind to destroy the world cycle, and first it raises a fine dust, and then coarse dust, and then fine sand, and then coarse sand, and then grit, stones. up to boulders as large ... as mighty trees on the hill tops.” - Visuddhi-Magga.

"Sun and moon stood still in heaven, and Thou didst stand in Thy wrath against our oppressors ... All the princes of the earth stood up, the kings of the nations had gathered themselves together ... Thou didst destroy them in Thy fury, and Thou didst ruin them in Thy rage. Nations raged from fear of Thee, kingdoms tottered because of Thy wrath ... Thou didst pour out Thy fury upon them ... Thou didst terrify them in Thy wrath ... The earth quaked and trembled from the noise of Thy thunders. Thou didst pursue them in Thy storm, Thou didst consume them in the whirlwind ... Their carcasses were like rubbish." - Book of Jasher [1]
