# 550 AD Event

- 540 AD tree ring anomalies
- 600 AD bond event
- 540 AD Baillie comet impact hypothesis
- Britain comet impact
- ~550 AD Teotihuacan decline
- ~550 AD India Bihar/Uttar Pradesh localized flood
- 540 AD Justinian plague
- 536 volcanic winter event

In terms of an exact date, probably mid 6th century (540 ADish) seems most likely in terms of convergence of existing evidence.

Baillie, a tree ring researcher, has compiled an impressive 540 AD comet impact hypothesis synthesis of historical evidence.

My current verdict is that there is just enough evidence that there was some kind of global climate anomaly during this time but not enough evidence to suggest a **global ECDO event**. I see no accounts of decades-long cataclysms or mountain-high floods, while there also seem to be significant historical happenings all over the globe during the most likely candidate date. Therefore I deem this event *unlikely* in terms of an ECDO flip. Based on the sparse material I have so far, something like a brush with a comet debris cloud seems more reasonable.

Still, what I've found so far warrants further investigation. Baillie's work has a lot of leads for further investigation.

## India History [1,3]

Indian history at this time is right at the breakup of the Gupta Empire (480 - 550) and afterwards.

"The start of the period is typically taken to be the slow collapse of the Gupta Empire from about 480 to 550,[21] ending the "classical" period, as well as "ancient India",[22] although both these terms may be used for periods with widely different dates, especially in specialised fields such as the history of art or religion." [3]

**"A 2019 study by archaeologist Shanker Sharma has concluded that the cause of the Gupta Empire's downfall was a devastating flood which happened around the middle of the 6th century in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar."** [4]

"After the decline of the Gupta Empire, the Later Guptas succeeded them as the rulers of Magadha.[3] The daughter of the dynasty's founder Krishnagupta is said to have married prince Adityavarman of the Maukhari dynasty. According to the Aphsad inscription of Ādityasena, Krishnagupta's grandson Jivitagupta carried out military expeditions in the Himalayan region and southwestern Bengal."

"During the reign of Jivitagupta's son Kumaragupta, the dynasty developed a rivalry with the Maukharis for control of the Ganges valley.[4] Kumaragupta defeated the Maukhari king Ishanavarman in 554 CE, and extended his territory to Prayaga. His son Damodaragupta suffered reverses against the Maukharis and was pushed back into Magadha."

"Damodaragupta's son Mahasenagupta allied with the Pushyabhuti dynasty. His sister married the ruler Adityavardhana. He invaded Kamarupa and defeated Susthita Varman.[7] But he subsequently faced three invaders: the Maukhari king Sharvavarman, the Kamarupa king Supratishthita-varman, and the Tibetan king Songtsen. His vassal Shashanka also abandoned him (and later established the independent Gauda Kingdom). The Maukhari king Sharvavarman is thought to have defeated Damodaragupta, invading Magadha circa 575 CE, which made him ruler of the entire Uttar Pradesh.[8][9] Under these circumstances, Mahasenagupta was forced to flee Magadha, and take shelter in Malwa. Subsequently, the Pushyabhuti emperor Harsha (ruled c. 606 – c. 647 CE) restored the Later Gupta rule in Magadha, and they ruled as Harsha's vassals."

### Uttar Pradesh Flood : Deluge Drowned Mighty Guptas (hard copy here)

This is promising. But given the lack of evidence convergence from other locations, I have to assume this was a case of localized flooding, perhaps due to excessive rainfall. I also note that the proposed flood area is behind a line of Himalayan freshwater lakes.

"Archaeologist Shanker Sharma has now provided evidence to show that almost every significant archaeological site in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh reveals silt deposits ranging from 0.6 metres to 2.5 metres, suggesting that the area was hit by disastrous floods. Balirajgarh (Madhubani), Kolhua, Raja Vishal Ka Garh and Chechar (Vaishali), Titra (Siwan), Chirand (Saran), Panr (Samastipur), Kumhrar (Patna), Champa (Bhagalpur), Kushinagar and Siddharthnagar (both in Uttar Pradesh) are some of such sites."

## China History

During this period, China was transitioning from the Northern and Southern Dynasties (lot of drama going on at the time), to the short-lived Sui Dynasty starting 581, to the Tang Dynasty in 618.

Of note is the volcanic winter of 536 - "Snow reportedly falls in August, which caused harvests to be delayed." [2]

Still, I see no mention of a flood.

### Northern Dynasties

"As conflict swelled in the north between successive leaders, Gao Huan took control of the east and Luoyang (holding Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei as a puppet ruler) by 534, while his rival Yuwen Tai took control of the west and the traditional Chinese capital of Chang'an by 535. The Western regime was dominated by the sinicized nobles and their Han bureaucrats while the Eastern regime was controlled by the traditional steppe tribes... Eventually, Gao Huan's son Gao Yang forced the Eastern Wei emperor to abdicate in favor of his claim to the throne, establishing the Northern Qi dynasty (551–577). Afterward, Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue seized the throne of power from Emperor Gong of Western Wei, establishing the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–580)." [7]

### Southern Dynasties

"Despite Emperor Wu's assurances, Hou decided to rebel in the name of Xiao Dong, the grandson of the former crown prince Xiao Tong who died in 531 and was removed from crown prince because of conflicts with his father... However, Chen Baxian was displeased with the arrangements, and in a surprise move killed Wang and deposed Emperor Min in favor of Xiao Fangzhi who became Emperor Jing of Liang. After a short reign, Chen deposed Emperor Jing and took power himself as Emperor Wu of Chen in 557." [7]

## Europe - Dark Ages

The Roman Empire split into the Western and Eastern in 395.

"The Dark Ages is a term for the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th–10th centuries), or occasionally the entire Middle Ages (c. 5th–15th centuries), in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which characterises it as marked by economic, intellectual, and cultural decline." [5]

A major plague (detailed below) but no obvious flood mention.

### Plague of Justinian [6]

"The plague of Justinian or Justinianic plague (AD 541–549) was an epidemic that afflicted the entire Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Near East, severely affecting the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire, especially Constantinople.[1][2][3] The plague is named for the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), who according to his court historian Procopius contracted the disease and recovered in 542, at the height of the epidemic which killed about a fifth of the population in the imperial capital.[1][2] The contagion arrived in Roman Egypt in 541, spread around the Mediterranean Sea until 544, and persisted in Northern Europe and the Arabian Peninsula until 549. By 543, the plague had spread to every corner of the empire.[4][1] As the first episode of the first plague pandemic, it had profound economic, social, and political effects across Europe and the Near East and cultural and religious impact on Eastern Roman society."

## Mesoamerica: Classic Period [8]

"Teotihuacan was "the Mesoamerican city par excellence". Its origins date to the late preclassic. Possibly, after the eruption of Xitle and with the decline of Cuicuilco, Teotihuacan came to house 75% of the population of the Mexican Basin in this era."

"The Teotihuacan chronology can be divided into six eras: ... Metepec (550-650): Decline of the city. 85 thousand inhabitants. Fire and drought. Loss of Mesoamerican dominance."

### Xitle (245-315 AD) [9]

"Xitle erupted during the period AD 245-315, according to the results of radiocarbon dating.[1] Among the consequences of this eruption were the formation of the Pedregal de San Ángel lava fields, to the south of the Mexican Federal District. Cuicuilco, one of the most refined cities of Mesoamerica, was destroyed and covered by lava."

### Teotihuacan 550 AD Decline

"The city reached its maximum population between 100 and 200 A.D., during the Xolalpan and Metepec phases. However, from 550 A.D. onwards, a drastic population decline, fires, and building collapses were reported, marking the beginning of the Epiclassic Period in the central highlands of Mexico. The abandonment of the city is related to the exodus to Xochicalco and the flourishing of Toltec culture in Tula." [10]
