# Holocene Mega Timeline

The scale is key here. We aren't looking for droughts, or floods, or famines. We are looking for a convergence of the land burning, decade and century long famines, water flowing over mountains, civilizations wiped out, all at once. Understand the scale involved here.

High-certainty ECDO-like geomagnetic-excursion cataclysms:
- ~2000 BC, Gun-Yu, Ogyges, Exodus, Crete
- ~3000 BC, recorded cataclysms from all cradles of civilization
- ~9700 BC, end of Younger Dryas, Atlantis

Promising:
- 6200 BC, climate/historical anomalies, black/med sea refilling
- 7500 BC, Tollman impact hypothesis, Uriel's Machine reference

Potential:
- 5400 BC, Nobulart's Noahic deluge date

Require further investigation:
- 400 BC, alexander the great, paleomagnetic anomalies

Unlikely dates:
- 550 AD, tree ring anomalies (might genuinely be a comet debris event, see paper in `biology`)
- 1200 BC, Late Minoan 2, Egypt, paleoclimate anomalies

Highly unlikely dates:
- 1200 AD

I still think there's so much work that can be done here. So many "if => then" ECDO implications that can be researched and fleshed out. The repo is turning into a proper goldmine but it's only the seeds for a proper refinement. Each lead could probably take a month to research properly.

## Fine-Tuning

Human accounts can be very useful in fine-tuning the timeline - for example, Exodus is accounted (by Velikovsky) as having happened in the spring. So if this was a global account it must have happened at the same time of the year elsewhere.

Events that are documented as being contemporary, or events where a certain temporal distance dependency is known, are also very helpful.

Another such detail would be accounts of the Sun having a certain specific anomalic trajectory (ex: the biblical Joshua cataclysm). These can then be cross-referenced wrt time of the day in other locations of the world.

Historical continuity of significant continued human activity without a recorded account of a flood may be the easiest way to "disprove" an ECDO event. Still, the ensuing chaos may have made it difficult to document the event properly.

## Non-exact cataclysm accounts

- Ancient Egypt, Herodotus: 341 generations of men up till 1290 BC (10k-4.7k years) 4 Sun changes (2 flips?)
- Plato: "Many great deluges" since Athens and Atlantis, a significant "third great flood before Deucalion" that washed away most of Athens' fertile soil

## 400 BC

Issue with this date is I would like to see more "civilizational collapse" to be sure. Or, perhaps people at this time were centered in safe locations in the near aftermath of the 2000 BC event? But, we see considerable societal disruption in the 2000 BC event which isn't long after the 3000 BC event. Wikipedia has a nice "world map" on this century [1]:

![](img/World_in_400_BCE.png)

- 340 BC: Alexander the Great Turkey deluge myth
- 373 BC: Helike Greek city-state submerged by Tsunami in winter
- 400 BC: La venta, Veracruz, Mexico, abandoned
- east Asia lacks history from this time

Physical markers:
- 200 BC potential tree ring anomalies
- 300 BC ice core anomaly
- 300 BC Mayan Chichancanab lake filling
- paleomagnetic anomalies (North America, Levantine Iron Age, 500 BC Russia peat deposit)
- 500 BC Antarctic tephra

Historical continuity during this period:
- Roman Republic
- Scythians

## 7400 BC event

- 7100 BC: Black Sea refilling
- 7400 BC: Sinking of Dvaravati (again)
- 7400 BC: bond event
- 7500 BC: Tollman bolide hypothesis
- Greenland ice cores
