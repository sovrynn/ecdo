# Holocene Mega Timeline

The scale is key here. We aren't looking for droughts, or floods, or famines. We are looking for a convergence of the land burning, decade and century long famines, water flowing over mountains, civilizations wiped out, all at once.

Almost certainly ECDO-like cataclysms:
- ~2000 BC, Gun-Yu, Exodus, Ogyges, Crete, Mohenjo-Daro
- ~3000 BC, Noah's flood, recorded cataclysms from all cradles of civilization

High-likelihood ECDO cataclysms:
- ~5600 BC, Biblical Creation, 6200 BC climate change event, black sea refilling
- ~9700 BC, end of Younger Dryas, Atlantis

Promising:
- 7400 BC, Tollman impact hypothesis, Uriel's Machine reference

Potential:
- 400 BC, alexander the great, paleomagnetic anomalies

Unlikely dates:
- 550 AD, tree ring anomalies (might genuinely be a comet debris event, see paper in `biology`)
- 1200 BC, Late Minoan 2, Egypt, paleoclimate anomalies

Highly unlikely dates:
- 1200 AD

I still think there's so much work that can be done here. So many "if => then" ECDO implications that can be researched and fleshed out. The repo is turning into a proper goldmine but it's only the seeds for a proper refinement. Each lead could probably take a month to research properly.

## Human timelines vs physical marker dating

Obviously we are looking for a great convergence of both, but in terms of preference I would say I have to prefer human timelines. When well-kept, they are more trustworthy than reconstructions from physical markers.

## Fine-Tuning

Detailed human accounts can be very useful in fine-tuning the timeline by aligning with accounts from other places in the world:
- time of the year (ex: Exodus in spring)
- contemporary events, or events with a known temporal distance from each other
- specific anomalic paths of the Sun (ex: Joshua)

Historical continuity of significant continued human activity without a recorded account of a flood may be the easiest way to "disprove" an ECDO event. Still, the ensuing chaos may have made it difficult to document the event properly.

## Non-exact cataclysm accounts

- Ancient Egypt, Herodotus: 341 generations of men up till 1290 BC (10k-4.7k years) 4 Sun changes (2 flips?)
- Plato: "Many great deluges" since Athens and Atlantis, a significant "third great flood before Deucalion" that washed away most of Athens' fertile soil
	- indicates there should be at least 3 floods after the Atlantis one. Currently we only have 2 high-certainty ones, 2000 and 3000 BC

## 400 BC

Issue with this date is I would like to see more "civilizational collapse" to be sure. Or, perhaps people at this time were centered in safe locations in the near aftermath of the 2000 BC event? But, we see considerable societal disruption in the 2000 BC event which isn't long after the 3000 BC event. Wikipedia has a nice "world map" on this century [1]:

![](img/World_in_400_BCE.png)

- 340 BC: Alexander the Great Turkey deluge myth
- 373 BC: Helike Greek city-state submerged by Tsunami in winter
- 400 BC: La venta, Veracruz, Mexico, abandoned
- east Asia lacks history from this time

Physical markers:
- 200 BC potential tree ring anomalies
- 300 BC ice core anomaly
- 300 BC Mayan Chichancanab lake filling
- paleomagnetic anomalies (North America, Levantine Iron Age, 500 BC Russia peat deposit)
- 500 BC Antarctic tephra

Historical continuity during this period:
- Roman Republic
- Scythians

## 7400 BC event

- 7100 BC: Black Sea refilling
- 7400 BC: Sinking of Dvaravati (again)
- 7400 BC: bond event
- 7500 BC: Tollman bolide hypothesis
- Greenland ice cores
