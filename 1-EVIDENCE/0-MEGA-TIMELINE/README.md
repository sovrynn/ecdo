# Holocene Mega Timeline

The scale is key here. We aren't looking for droughts, or floods, or famines. We are looking for a convergence of the land burning, decade and century long famines, water flowing over mountains, civilizations wiped out, all at once.

Almost certainly ECDO-like cataclysms:
- ~2000 BC, Gun-Yu, Exodus, Ogyges, Crete, Mohenjo-Daro
- ~3000 BC, Noah's flood, recorded cataclysms from all cradles of civilization

High-likelihood ECDO cataclysms:
- ~5600 BC, Biblical Creation, 6200 BC climate change event, black sea refilling
- ~9700 BC, end of Younger Dryas, Atlantis

High potential:
- 7400 BC, Tollman impact hypothesis, sinking of Dvaravati

Unlikely:
- 550 AD, tree ring anomalies (might genuinely be a comet debris event, see paper in `biology`)
- 400 BC, alexander the great, paleomagnetic anomalies
- 1200 BC, Late Minoan 2, Egypt, paleoclimate anomalies

Highly unlikely:
- 1200 AD

I still think there's so much work that can be done here. So many "if => then" ECDO implications that can be researched and fleshed out. The repo is turning into a proper goldmine but it's only the seeds for a proper refinement. Each lead could probably take a month to research properly.

## Human timelines vs physical marker dating

Obviously we are looking for a great convergence of both, but in terms of preference I would say I have to prefer human timelines. When well-kept, they are more trustworthy than reconstructions from physical markers.

## Fine-Tuning

Detailed human accounts can be very useful in fine-tuning the timeline by aligning with accounts from other places in the world:
- time of the year (ex: Exodus in spring)
- contemporary events, or events with a known temporal distance from each other
- specific anomalic paths of the Sun (ex: Joshua)

Historical continuity of significant continued human activity without a recorded account of a flood may be the easiest way to "disprove" an ECDO event. Still, the ensuing chaos may have made it difficult to document the event properly.

## Non-exact cataclysm accounts

- Ancient Egypt, Herodotus: 341 generations of men up till 1290 BC (10k-4.7k years) 4 Sun changes (2 flips?)
- Plato: "Many great deluges" since Athens and Atlantis, a significant "third great flood before Deucalion" that washed away most of Athens' fertile soil
	- indicates there should be at least 3 floods after the Atlantis one. Currently we only have 2 high-certainty ones, 2000 and 3000 BC
