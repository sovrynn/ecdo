# ~2000 BC event (2200 - 1700 BC)

This 500-year period is filled with extensive evidence from all domains, including history and physical markers. Along with accounts of mega-floods (Gun-Yu, Ogyges), prolonged flooding (Gun-Yu), and the Sun changing trajectory (Gun-Yu, Joshua) corresponding with cataclysm markers across the globe, we can almost be certain there was an ECDO-like event during this period.

This period in particular is a bit of a mess. I want to organize everything into a single timeline and establish temporal dependencies. Everything should line up.

I also want a timeline of the exact sequence of specific climate effects if possible. For example: flood, then drought, then Y, etc. This time period has the most detailed accounts, which would help build such a sequencing.

## Overview

Cataclysm accounts:
- 1800-1400 BC: Biblical Exodus, Moses
	- Possibly a contemporary of Ogyges and Gun-Yu, typically placed 900-1100 years after Noah's flood. Joshua cataclysm occurred about 40 years after
- 1900-1460 BC: Deucalion
	- Usually placed some time after Ogyges
- ~1800 BC: Ancient Peru, invaders destroyed by fire, and some extended time later, 24 hours of Sun
    - 12th of 40 generations between 2400 BC and 400 BC
- 2136-1800 BC: Ogyges
	- Said to be contemporary with Moses in Exodus, and possibly Gun-Yu
	- Velikovsky places it in the middle of the second millenium BC
- 2300-2000 BC: Chinese Great Gun-Yu Flood
	- water over mountains, sun not setting for 10 days
	- Contemporary with Korea's Dangun myth
	- Possibly contemporary with Ogyges
	- Corresponds to 1920 BC dated Yellow River flood remnants

Cataclysm events:
- 1900 BC - 1700 BC: Mohenjo-Daro abandonment
- 1700-1650 BC: Minoan Crete, two catastrophes within a half century of each other
- ~1700 BC: various burned Mesopotamian cities
- 1800 BC Caral (Peru) abandonment
- 2000-1900 BC India flood remnants

Physical markers:
- 1650 BC Antarctic tephra
- ~1750 BC: human remains from multiple places around the world
- 1960 BC Deception Island volcano, Antarctica
- 2200 BC North Atlantic bond (ice rafting) event
- 2200-2100 BC: climate aridification event
- 2345 BC: Irish Oak tree rings
- 2000 BC Kilimanjaro ice cores
- 2500 BC Skara Brae abandonment

In terms of a single candidate date for the cataclysm, it's quite difficult to choose one, as the events are spread out all over this period from as early as 2350 BC to as late as 1400 BC. If I had to choose one, it would be 2000 BC, as this seems the latest reasonable date for the start of the Xia dynasty, and is within reasonable timeframes for the Ogyges and Exodus cataclysms.

## Sun changing trajectory

There are some inconsistencies that need to be reconciled here.

- Gun-Yu flood (10 days sun)
	- prolonged 22 year flood implies this event began from S1 -> S2
	- implies some kind of non-simplicity in the rotation. This would be explained by China rotating during the winter solstice (it would move towards the arctic) but this doesn't line up with the spring timeline of Exodus
- Exodus
	- spring
- Phaethon (1 day no sun)
- Peru (Inca) myths (24 hours sun)
- Joshua (Sun frozen low on horizon)
    - Assuming this was from the Mediterranean region, this is well within bounds of the ECDO model - rotating north along the sunrise boundary

Due to the temporal sequentiality between Exodus and Joshua, I believe this event can be organized the following way:
- S1 to S2: Exodus (spring), Gun-Yu (daytime)
- S2 to S1: Joshua (morning)

## Velikovsky

Velikovsky, bless him, has compiled an extensive and comprehensive compilation of cataclysm accounts for this period. Note: I haven't checked most of his sources.

### Chronology

Typically, Deucalion is placed after Ogyges. But Velikovsky argues that Deucalion came before Ogyges. Here is his timeline:

First: Deucalion, Phaethon, Exodus

Second: Joshua, Ogyges

Yahou contemporary with one of these two events.

Since Exodus and Joshua happened so close to each other (~40 years) we can basically bunch these all up into one event. We also have Moses who lived for 120 years and was 80 at the time of Exodus; many of these other events are cited as being contemporary to him. So these temporal dependencies are good anchor points in my opinion.

### Cataclysm Details

Yahou: Sun did not set for a number of days, forests on fire, vermin filled the country. No dust.

Exodus (WIC pg 116):
- 4 times the Sun was changed out of its course in the few weeks between Exodus and Lawgiving
- prolonged darkness?
- hurricane flips?
- sun comes down at noon? (not sure if its this event)
- Lawgiving: motion of Sun disturbed
- darkness for months afterwards
- **occurred in the spring**
- hot hailstones in the air (comet debris)
- ~50 days between Exodus and Lawgiving
- Moses was 80 years old at Exodus

Aztecs, Mayans:
- No Sun for many years
- **finally rose in the East**

Joshua:
- same comet debris from Exodus
- sun and moon stood still for a full day
- ~40 years after Exodus
- Moses passed away before Joshua (according to Velikovsky)
- **"The sun, thrown into confusion, had remained low on the horizon, and by not rising** had spread terror amongst the great doctors" (see repo bible evidence page on this event)

Phaethon:
- **Sun dissapeared for a day**
- vast conflagration

## Yao

The Shu King, the Canon of Yao [1]:

"He commanded the Xis and Hes, in reverent accordance with (their observation of) the wide heavens, to calculate and delineate (the movements and appearances of) the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiacal spaces, and so to deliver respectfully the seasons to be observed by the people.

He separately commanded the second brother Xi to reside at Yu-yi, in what was called the Bright Valley, and (there) respectfully to receive as a guest the rising sun, and to adjust and arrange the labours of the spring. 'The day,' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Niao - you may thus exactly determine mid-spring. The people are dispersed (in the fields), and birds and beasts breed and copulate.'

He further commanded the third brother Xi to reside at Nan-jiao, (in what was called the Brilliant Capital). to adjust and arrange the transformations of the summer, and respectfully-to observe the exact limit (of the shadow). 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its longest, and the star is in Huo - you may thus exactly determine mid-summer. The people are more dispersed; and birds and beasts have their feathers and hair thin, and change their coats.'

He separately commanded the second brother He to reside at the west, in what was called the Dark Valley, and (there) respectfully to convoy the setting sun, and to adjust and arrange the completing labours of the autumn. 'The night' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Xu - you may thus exactly determine mid-autumn. The people feel at ease, and birds and beasts have their coats in good condition.'

He further commanded the third brother He to reside in the northern region, in what was called the Sombre Capital, and (there) to adjust and examine the changes of the winter. 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its shortest, and the star is in Mao - you may thus exactly determine mid-winter. The people, keep in their houses, and the coats of birds and beasts are downy and thick.'"

- Yu-yi, Rising sun, star in Niao
- Nanjiao, star is in Huo
- West, Dark Valley, setting sun, star in Xu
- northern region, Sombre Capital

### Yellow River Flood Remnants

Evidence of serious Yellow River flood at 1920 BC.

### Yao Sources to check

Johann Heinrich Zedler "Universal Lexicon" for Yao

## India

Around this period, India had the Indus Valley civilization in the northwest.

The Vedic period lasted from about 1500 BC to 500 BC.

Books around this time period:
- Rigveda
	- don't see historical content, at least on surface level summaries
- Mahabharata
	- the Wikipedia page on this book doesn't mention a flood, indicating how deep one may have to dig to find flood references
- Bhagavata Purana

### North India Flood Remnants

Evidence of a flood around 2000 - 1900 BC.

## Mesoamerica

Around this time you have the first traces of the Mayas, and soon afterwards, the Olmec.

## South America

Around this time you have the decline and abandonment of the Caral-Supe (Norte-Chico) civilization in Peru.

Same for the Valdivia culture.
