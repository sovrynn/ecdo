# 2200 - 1700 BC event

So you've got all the basic flood myths - Yao, Ogyges, Exodus, Joshua, etc, around this period.

What I'd like to do is dig into these accounts to find the most details. Establish temporal dependencies. And establish a historical timeline of what was going on in the world at the time. Everything should line up. I also want a timeline of the exact sequence of specific climate effects if possible. For example: flood, then drought, then Y, etc.

I'll just paste in what I have for now.

## Overview

This 500-year period is filled with extensive evidence from all domains, including history and physical markers. Along with accounts of mega-floods (Gun-Yu, Ogyges), we can almost be certain there was an ECDO-like event during this period. The wide spread of dates makes me wonder if there may be more than one cataclysm in this date range.

Cataclysm accounts:
- 1600-1400 BC: Biblical Exodus, Moses
	- Possibly a contemporary of Ogyges and Gun-Yu
- 1900-1460 BC: Deucalion
	- Usually placed some time after Ogyges
	- 1700-1650 BC: Minoan Crete, two catastrophes within a half century of each other
- 1900 BC - 1700 BC: Mohenjo-Daro abandonment
- ~1800 BC: Ancient Peru, invaders destroyed by fire, and some extended time later, 24 hours of Sun
- 2136-1800 BC: Ogyges
	- Said to be contemporary with Moses in Exodus, and possibly Gun-Yu
- 2300-2000 BC: Chinese Great Gun-Yu Flood
	- water over mountains, sun not setting for 10 days
	- Contemporary with Korea's Dangun myth
	- Possibly contemporary with Ogyges
	- Backed up by 1920 BC dated Yellow River flood remnants

Physical markers:
- 1650 BC Antarctic tephra
- 2200 BC bond (ice rafting) event
- 2200-2100 BC: climate aridification event

## Yao

The Shu King, the Canon of Yao [1]:

"He commanded the Xis and Hes, in reverent accordance with (their observation of) the wide heavens, to calculate and delineate (the movements and appearances of) the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiacal spaces, and so to deliver respectfully the seasons to be observed by the people.

He separately commanded the second brother Xi to reside at Yu-yi, in what was called the Bright Valley, and (there) respectfully to receive as a guest the rising sun, and to adjust and arrange the labours of the spring. 'The day,' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Niao - you may thus exactly determine mid-spring. The people are dispersed (in the fields), and birds and beasts breed and copulate.'

He further commanded the third brother Xi to reside at Nan-jiao, (in what was called the Brilliant Capital). to adjust and arrange the transformations of the summer, and respectfully-to observe the exact limit (of the shadow). 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its longest, and the star is in Huo - you may thus exactly determine mid-summer. The people are more dispersed; and birds and beasts have their feathers and hair thin, and change their coats.'

He separately commanded the second brother He to reside at the west, in what was called the Dark Valley, and (there) respectfully to convoy the setting sun, and to adjust and arrange the completing labours of the autumn. 'The night' (said he), 'is of the medium length, and the star is in Xu - you may thus exactly determine mid-autumn. The people feel at ease, and birds and beasts have their coats in good condition.'

He further commanded the third brother He to reside in the northern region, in what was called the Sombre Capital, and (there) to adjust and examine the changes of the winter. 'The day,' (said he), 'is at its shortest, and the star is in Mao - you may thus exactly determine mid-winter. The people, keep in their houses, and the coats of birds and beasts are downy and thick.'"

- Yu-yi, Rising sun, star in Niao
- Nanjiao, star is in Huo
- West, Dark Valley, setting sun, star in Xu
- northern region, Sombre Capital
