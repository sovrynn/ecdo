# 1200 AD Event - Initial Verdict: Unlikely

- 1130-1450: Chaco Canyon abandonment, drought and climate instability
- 1169 Sicily Earthquake
- 1190/1252 CE: Antarctic tephra
- 1300 AD: Yuan Empire downfall

I don't see bond events or tree ring anomalies around these dates, at least in the notable literature, which bothers me. Also no notable "global flood" narratives in this most recent period of history, along with major happenings in Egypt, India, and China.

My base case is no ECDO flip, and simply a period of regular rotational and magnetic variation that explains these "anomalies".

## 1169 Sicily Earthquake

"The 1169 Sicily earthquake occurred on 4 February 1169 at 08:00 local time on the eve of the feast of St. Agatha of Sicily (in southern Italy). It had an estimated magnitude of between 6.4 and 7.3 and an estimated maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The cities of Catania, Lentini and Modica were severely damaged, and the earthquake also triggered a paleotsunami. Overall, the earthquake is estimated to have caused the deaths of at least 15,000 people."

"Tsunami deposits correlated with this earthquake have been found both onshore[7] and offshore.[8] The tsunami is also thought to be responsible for moving several large boulders from the middle of the sublittoral zone onto the coast between Augusta and Syracuse."

## Chinese History

### Yuan Empire Downfall - 1300 AD

This all happened 700 years ago - during the Wolf Minimum. "This is what seems to have happened to the Yuan Empire in the fourteenth century. Historical records of this era are filled with natural disasters, especially between 1300 and 1359. This period witnessed a surge in every imaginable type of natural disaster all over the country: frequent super typhoons along the southeastern coast; recurrent floods of both the Yangtze and Yellow River deltas; locust plagues (associated with droughts) on the central plain; and two significant earthquakes in central China in 1303 and 1305 that caused over 270,000 fatalities. Last but not least, a series of epidemics swept through the region between 1352 and 1362, the worst of which caused two hundred thousand deaths in the capital area alone in 1358. The Chinese scholar He Fuqiang has calculated that, in the 109 years between 1260 and 1368, the empire suffered at least two major disasters per year, with five different disasters occurring in four out of every five years. For more than a third of the Yuan era, the empire experienced at least seven distinct natural calamities within the same year." - this all sounds a lot like what's going on across much of Asia right now. They must have had a lot of livestock to have caused such serious climate change 700 years ago.

### 1200 BC event: Song Dynasty

"The Song dynasty (/sʊŋ/) was an imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 960 to 1279."

This part of Chinese history seems to be well dated. The Song Dynasty has significant happenings around 1200.

"Although the Song dynasty was able to hold back the Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), initially invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin.[48] The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt.[49] Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces in 1233/34."

## Egypt History

Egypt was under Muslim rule during this period.

"After Saladin's death in 1193, his sons contested control of the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil ultimately became the sultan in 1200. All of the later Ayyubid sultans of Egypt were his descendants. In the 1230s, the emirs of Syria attempted to assert their independence from Egypt and the Ayyubid realm remained divided until Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored its unity by subduing most of Syria, except Aleppo, by 1247. By then, local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen, the Hijaz, and parts of Mesopotamia. After his death in 1249, as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by his son al-Mu'azzam Turanshah. However, the latter was soon overthrown by his Mamluk generals who had repelled a Crusader invasion of the Nile Delta. This effectively ended Ayyubid power in Egypt. Attempts by the emirs of Syria, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo, to wrest back Egypt failed. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and conquered the Ayyubids' remaining territories soon after. The Mamluks, who expelled the Mongols, maintained the Ayyubid principality of Hama until deposing its last ruler in 1341." [2]

## India History

India was also being conquered by the Muslims during this time.

"The Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent mainly took place between the 13th and the 18th centuries, establishing the Indo-Muslim period."

"After the capture of Lahore and the end of the Ghaznavids, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor laid the foundation of Muslim rule in India in 1192. In 1202, Bakhtiyar Khalji led the Muslim conquest of Bengal, marking the easternmost expansion of Islam at the time."

"The disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate, capped by Timur's invasion in 1398, caused several Muslim sultanates and dynasties to emerge across the Indian subcontinent, such as the Gujarat Sultanate, Malwa Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate, Jaunpur Sultanate, Madurai Sultanate, and the Bengal Sultanate."

## ChatGPT: Notable Cataclysmic Events Around 1200 AD

### 1. **Volcanic Eruptions**
   - **Mount Samalas Eruption (1257 AD)**:  
     One of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history, this eruption on the island of Lombok, Indonesia, released an immense amount of volcanic ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. It led to a global "volcanic winter," causing cooling, poor harvests, famine, and societal disruptions worldwide.

   - **Hekla Eruption (circa 1158 and 1206 AD)**:  
     The Icelandic volcano Hekla, known as the "Gateway to Hell" in medieval times, erupted multiple times around this period. While not as impactful globally as Samalas, Hekla’s eruptions contributed to regional climate effects, causing localized cooling and ashfall in Europe.

### 2. **Earthquakes**
   - **Sicily Earthquake (1169 AD)**:  
     A deadly earthquake struck near Catania, Sicily, with an estimated magnitude of 7.0 or higher. It destroyed much of Catania and triggered a large tsunami. Thousands were killed, and the event had a lasting impact on the region.

   - **Northern Syria Earthquake (1170 AD)**:  
     A major earthquake hit Northern Syria and parts of the Levant, causing severe damage to cities like Aleppo and Hama. With an estimated magnitude between 7.1 and 7.7, it resulted in tens of thousands of casualties, with aftershocks causing further destruction.

   - **Central Asia Earthquake (1253 AD)**:  
     This earthquake struck the area around Bukhara, in modern-day Uzbekistan, causing significant damage to settlements along the Silk Road and disrupting trade routes, which impacted local economies.

### 3. **Climatic Shifts and Famine**
   - **Medieval Warm Period (9th–14th centuries)**:  
     Although generally warmer, this period saw episodes of cooling and increased storm activity, particularly in the 13th century. Harsh winters and cool summers contributed to crop failures and famine in various regions.

   - **Great Famine of 1315–1317**:  
     While slightly outside the 1200s, this famine resulted from prolonged cold and wet weather across Northern Europe, leading to widespread starvation and setting the stage for subsequent challenges, including the Black Death.

### 4. **Plagues and Epidemics**
   - **Outbreaks of Plague and Leprosy**:  
     The 13th century experienced sporadic outbreaks of diseases such as plagues, affecting local populations across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Chroniclers recorded these diseases, which spread rapidly following climatic events that weakened public health.

   - **The Great Pestilence (1237–1241 AD)**:  
     Various sources describe outbreaks of virulent diseases that affected parts of Europe and Asia. While it's unclear if this was the plague, it had a noticeable impact on populations already weakened by famine and environmental stress.

### 5. **Other Cataclysmic Events**
   - **Mongol Invasions**:  
     Not a natural disaster, but the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan caused massive destruction across Eurasia, including razed cities, population displacements, and severe impacts on local economies and environments.

   - **Destruction of Baghdad (1258 AD)**:  
     The Mongol siege and destruction of Baghdad, then a cultural and intellectual hub, led to enormous cultural losses, with libraries burned and knowledge lost, setting back regional scholarship and development.
