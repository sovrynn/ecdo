# 3200 - 2800 BC event

This 400-year period is filled with extensive evidence that points to a global cataclysm. Multiple accounts of ECDO-like cataclysms (megafloods, Sun changing direction) from different places in the world gives us a high certainty there was an ECDO-like event during this period.

## Chinese Nu Wa Myth Dating

"It is of some interest to note that Chinese myths indicate that the Flood event occurred at the end of the life of Nu Wa, consort of first Chinese emperor Fsu Hsi (2953 - 2838 BC according to standard chronologies), and who herself allegedly lived until about the year 2810 BC." - Bruce Masse

"The legendary emperor Fuxi was believed to be the First Sovereign of the creation myth of Chinese civilization. Fuxi was the twin brother of Nuwa and, after escaping a great flood, the siblings lived together on Mount Kunlun. Fuxi and Nuwa are believed to be the progenitors of the human race." [1]

Regarding the dates of his rule, it's still not clear what exactly these dates are based off of.

"Fu Xi is part of the "Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors" (三皇五帝) mythology, a group of semi-divine, legendary figures said to have ruled before China's first historical dynasty, the Xia." [2]

### Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors

"There are six to seven known variations on which people constitute the Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors, depending on the source. Many of the known sources were written in much later dynasties.

Groupings of the Three Sovereigns consist of some combination of the following: Fuxi, Nüwa, Shennong, Suiren, Zhu Rong, Gonggong, the Heavenly Sovereign, the Earthly Sovereign, the Human Sovereign (in two varieties), and the Yellow Emperor.

Groupings of the Five Emperors consist of some combination of the following: the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, Shaohao, Taihao, and the Yan Emperor." [3]

First on my bucketlist is verifying the date of the Nu Wa myth, which specifically references a China rotation in the direction of the ECDO. The dating comes from Bruce Masse's work
