# 6200 BC Event

There's a decent convergence of physical markers around this date. The most compelling to me is the convergence of evidence in the 6200 BC climate change event.

- 5800 BC: Mayan Chichancanab lake filling
- 6000 BC: meltwater pulse 1c
- 6200 BC: bond event
- 6200 BC: Greenland ice core
- 6200 BC: well documented cooling and aridification climate change event
- 6200 BC: Storegga underwater landslide
- 6300 BC: Kilimanjaro ice cores
- 6400 BC: Black Sea refilling (William Ryan)

## 6200 BC Climate Change Event

"The sea-level data from the Rhine–Meuse Delta indicate a 2–4 m (6 ft 7 in – 13 ft 1 in) of near-instantaneous rise at 8.54 to 8.2 ka, in addition to 'normal' post-glacial sea-level rise."

"In northwestern Madagascar, the 8.2 ka event is associated with a negative δ18O excursion and calcite deposition, indicating wet, humid conditions caused by the southward migration of the ITCZ.... Humidification was two-phased, with an 8.3 kiloyear sub-event preceding the 8.2 kiloyear sub-event by about 20 years."

"The sediment core records of the Fram Strait show a short-lived cooling during the 8.2 ka event superimposed on a broader interval of warm climate.[38] In western Scotland, the 8.2 ka event coincided with a dramatic reduction in the Mesolithic population.[39] In the Iberian Peninsula, the 8.2 ka event is linked to greater summer aridity that caused an increase in the frequency of fires and a consequent expansion of fire-resistant evergreen oak trees."

"Lacustrine sediment records show that Western Siberia underwent humidification during the 8.2 ka event."

"The South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) drastically intensified during the 8.2 ka event as revealed by sediment records from Juréia Paleolagoon."
