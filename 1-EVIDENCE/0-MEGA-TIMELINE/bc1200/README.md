# 1400-1200 BC Event

This period is far enough away from 2000 BC to warrant its own investigation as a potential cataclysm. There is evidence from many domains pointing to a possible cataclysm in this time.

- 1400 BC: Minoan Crete's third and final cataclysm
- traditional dating of Exodus/Deucalion to approximately this period
- 1400-1200 BC Egyptian dark age (see Barbara Bell)
- 1159 BC Narrow Irish tree rings
- 1416 BC Antarctic tephra
- 1200 BC Mediterranean cooling climate change event

New additions:
- 1350 BC Palaikastro tsunami deposits
- 1300-1200 BC Gramalote food rationing and abandonment (Source: The Early Initial Period Fishing Settlement of Gramalote, Moche Valley: A Preliminary Report (`EVIDENCE/civilization-remnants/ancient-cities`))
- 1200 BC destruction of Ugarit (Middle East)

While the physical markers are compelling, I have to initially bucket this event as unlikely due to lack of easily-found cataclysm records from China and India during this period. Obviously worth a deeper investigation.

## China - Shang Dynasty (1600 - 1046 BC) [1]

The Shang dynasty existed in China during this period. A cursory search doesn't seem to show any major cataclysm recorded during this dynasty.

## India - Early Vedic Period (1500 - 1000 BC) [2]

Cursory search not turning up major recorded cataclysms during this period.
