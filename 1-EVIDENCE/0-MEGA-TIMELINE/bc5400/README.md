# 5400 BC Event

Adding a folder for Nobulart's candidate Noah's Flood event. 3700 year periodicity with 1700 BC and 9100 BC.

One of the difficulties with this date is we pretty much don't have recorded history going back this far... So we essentially only have physical markers to go off of. Additionally some of the physical markers drop off before this date (ex: tree ring chronologies), or at least the literature on it does.

- 5000 BC: Syrian coastal climate change
- 5300 BC: Nabta Playa abandonment
- 5325 BC: Shetland tsunami deposit
- 5400 BC: Catal Huyuk abandonment
- 5800 BC: Mayan Chichancanab lake filling

I'll include events closer to 6200 BC in a separate study, although this evidence could potentially be overlapping the same event.

My verdict is that I just don't see enough evidence to have any certainty in this date, while acknowledging that evidence going back so far in time will be sparse.
