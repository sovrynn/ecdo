# 7400 BC Event

Pretty standard set of evidence here. Nothing extremely compelling. Perhaps I should put more stock in the Dvaravati dating.

Cataclysm accounts:
- 7400 BC: Sinking of Dvaravati, Rohini Sakata Bheda cosmic alignment

Physical markers:
- 7100 BC: Black Sea refilling
- 7300 BC: Greenland ice cores
- 7400 BC: bond event - glacier activity in Norway and cold event in China
- 7500 BC: Tollman bolide hypothesis
	- tree rings, tektites, youngest mammoth

New additions:
- 7300 BC Lake Sidi, Western Mediterranean/North Africa core O18 spike

## Dvaravati Sinking

This dating comes from Vedveer Arya, who compiled a lengthy timeline of India, placing the Manu deluge at the same time as the Atlantis sinking.

It has an alignment with Rohini Sakata Bheda, an Indian cosmic alignment.

## China History

In China, around this time, you have the appearance of several cultures - Zengpiyan, Pengtoushan, and Peiligang. [1]

Could be similar to the case where the Olmecs "suddenly appear" in Mesoamerica around 1500 BC, which would be after the 2000 BC event.

"Zengpiyan (Chinese: 甑皮岩; pinyin: Zèngpíyán) is a Neolithic cave site in southern China... Excavations have so far yielded over 30 human corpses, 110 kinds of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, over 1,000 pieces of polished and pierced stone and bone ware, animal teeth, mussel shells and over 10,000 pieces of pottery. Many fireplaces and waste pits were also discovered. In the back of the cave stone material is piled up. In older sediments semi-finished stone tools were abundant. Pierced stone tools and polished stone tools were unearthed from more recent layers. Bone artifacts included fishing spears (Yubiao 鱼镖), arrowheads (zú 镞) needles (zhēn 针) and hairpins (jī 笄)." [2]

In Uriel's Machine, Robert Bauval is quoted as citing a 7000 BC geomagnetic anomaly
