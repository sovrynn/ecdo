# 5500 BC Event (6400 - 5000 BC)

This is a very wide range of dates but I'm bucketing it into one event for now since there could be quite a bit of dating error going back so far in time. With a diverse array of physical markers and a Biblical cataclysm account, along with a very compelling well-studied climate change event (6200 BC), I'm bucketing this one as a likely ECDO event.

Some of the physical markers (ex: tree ring chronologies) and most of recorded history drop off this far back, so we don't have as much to work with.

Cataclysm accounts:
- 5500 BC: Creation
- 5500 BC: Aldebaran Hindu astronomy alignment

Physical markers:
- 5000 BC: Syrian coastal climate change
- 5325 BC: Shetland tsunami deposit (unadjusted date)
- 5400 BC: Illumetsa crater field, Estonia
- 5400 BC: Fennoscandian earthquake, Ojala et al. (2018)
- 5800 BC: Mayan Chichancanab lake filling
- 6000 BC: meltwater pulse 1c
- 6200 BC: bond event
- 6200 BC: Greenland ice core
- 6200 BC: well documented cooling and aridification climate change event
- 6200 BC: Storegga underwater landslide
- 6300 BC: Kilimanjaro ice cores
- 6400 BC: Black Sea refilling (William Ryan)

Abandoned settlements:
- 5300 BC: Nabta Playa abandonment
- 5400 BC: Catal Huyuk abandonment

New additions:
- 5500 BC Illumetsa crater field, Estonia
- 6000-5000 BC Lake Sevan, Armenia, high lake levels
- 6500-5400 BC Latvian Lake creation: https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0959683616683255

## Exact date

I've selected 5500 BC as the candidate date for now based on the Biblical Creation datings. I think there's a possibility carbon-dating and adjacent methods may have more significant error than human timelines which should (theoretically) be more deterministic.

## 6200 BC Climate Change Event

"The sea-level data from the Rhine–Meuse Delta indicate a 2–4 m (6 ft 7 in – 13 ft 1 in) of near-instantaneous rise at 8.54 to 8.2 ka, in addition to 'normal' post-glacial sea-level rise."

"In northwestern Madagascar, the 8.2 ka event is associated with a negative δ18O excursion and calcite deposition, indicating wet, humid conditions caused by the southward migration of the ITCZ.... Humidification was two-phased, with an 8.3 kiloyear sub-event preceding the 8.2 kiloyear sub-event by about 20 years."

"The sediment core records of the Fram Strait show a short-lived cooling during the 8.2 ka event superimposed on a broader interval of warm climate.[38] In western Scotland, the 8.2 ka event coincided with a dramatic reduction in the Mesolithic population.[39] In the Iberian Peninsula, the 8.2 ka event is linked to greater summer aridity that caused an increase in the frequency of fires and a consequent expansion of fire-resistant evergreen oak trees."

"Lacustrine sediment records show that Western Siberia underwent humidification during the 8.2 ka event."

"The South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) drastically intensified during the 8.2 ka event as revealed by sediment records from Juréia Paleolagoon."
