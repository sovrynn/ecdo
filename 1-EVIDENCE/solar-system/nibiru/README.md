# Nibiru / Marduk

## Critique

I am sympathetic towards this theory, but I need more evidence and less hearsay. I think the basics of the Nibiru theory aligns well with mythology and breadcrumbs in ancient literary texts. 

But, if you could boil it all down, what would you say is the best concrete repeatable evidence for the existence of Nibiru?

Where are these pics of Niburu? Would be nice to see the evidence.

Evidence would be seen in the movements of the Sun. We can clearly see the effect of the JUNS planets. There is no discernible signal in the Sun-SSB originating from any bodies other than those we know of. Nibiru theory needs to explain this discrepancy with observation or, as Feynman said, "the theory is just wrong".

I've scanned through this video again and feel the content is important but don't have the knowledge to work out why and its bothering me! I find the idea compelling that the Sun has its own orbit round a binary star and that this accounts for the precession of the equinoxes. Should this affect our thinking regards the catastrophe cycle and even the role of the air shafts? Was the shaft pointing North in S1 or S2 for observation or for channelling something other than air? A precession of 26,000 years is divisible by 3,700 years. Sitchen talked about Nibiru making a fly by every 3,600 years. Do we learn to live with this cycle through the Silver and Golden ages and are relearning again as we come out of Iron? Is our general development in ascendency and we learn to cope better with each Great Year better each time. I.E the pyramids were constructed at the height of the last golden age (c.11,500 years ago according to the air shaft star chart) and we will have even more incredible technology in the next golden age starting in about 6,500 years?

Sitchen reckoned Marduk, "the 12th planet", orbits the sun every 3,600 years. This work seems to be written off the same script...

## The Scientific truth about Planet Nine

"The constellation of Taurus is one of the leading candidate locations for the hypothesized Planet Nine. The bright star Aldebaran and the Hyades star cluster are the most easily identifiable objects to the naked eye in Taurus."

https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/05/09/the-scientific-truth-about-planet-nine-so-far/

From the work of a guy named Konstantin and Mike Brown, AI summation:

"According to current theories, if Planet 9 exists, it is most likely located in the direction of the constellation Taurus, with some estimations placing it near the bright star Aldebaran and the Hyades star cluster, which are visible to the naked eye in that constellation. 

Key points about Planet 9's potential location:
Based on orbital patterns:
Scientists have inferred the possible position of Planet 9 by studying the unusual orbits of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which suggest a gravitational influence from a large body in that region. 

Observable from Earth:
While Planet 9 is theorized to be very far away, it could potentially be observed using powerful telescopes if it exists. 

No confirmed sighting:
As of today, Planet 9 has not been directly observed and its existence remains a hypothesis. "

## Binary Star Nibiru

Coming from my own astronomy classes in the 1970s, 60% of all stars are binary. 
Meaning that they revolve around one another, some more regularly distanced, and others with more eclipticsl patterns.
An additional 15% are trinary. Three stars with various orbital patterns. 

Our Solaris, our sun, has a brown dwarf binary SiStar. She has eight(?) + planets and moons and some of them interphase with our own solar system at intervals. 

Given that we are within a binary system expanding from a central point—there are dual axes of two solar systems. This binary star systems perform a cosmic dance as they are propelled outwardly from galactic center. 
The axes diverge slightly (in terms of human history). Certain planets amount than have extended, or wide orbits allowing them to Shelly interact with both solar systems.
Jupiter and Saturn are among those who engaege in the brown dwarf SiStar revolution.. perhaps others.

Alas, the true information of the stars given to us from ancients of the orient Chinese writings, Mayans, etc— are not readily available to us. 
(The electronic CON-•trollers have disappeared it.) go ogle.


To cut it a bit short, Niburu is closer now, and evidence (pics)  have been seen and photographed world wide by everyday folks. Russia has gotten done awesome views of the fiery red horned dragon/winged disk which was well documented and respected in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian art.

There is perhaps a 30 degree variance off of our solar system plane— so that the appearance will take on sine wave motion on the ecliptic.

This means some 3-5(?) days above and another below the horizon. 
SO CALENDAR the days if “cloudy” skies. KEEP WATCH. This is the time of year to catch some glimpses from obscure locations.  Red skies can be in the west.
Between Nov to March. 
Eyes open. No fear. Camera Ready! Hard drive your finding.
