# Encke Comet

## Analysis [1]

"The periodic Comet 2P/Encke is one of the most mysterious and befuddling objects in the Solar System. 2P/Encke is a bright, low-inclination comet on an orbit with a surprisingly small aphelion distance (Q) of only 4.1 AU. As such, although similar to Jupiter-family comets (JFCs, comets with Tisserand parameters with respect to Jupiter, T , between 2 and 3; see Levison, 1996) in other respects, 2P/Encke is dynamically decoupled from Jupiter... We found that only 1 out of âˆ¼11,000 initially transneptunian objects will evolve onto an Encke-like orbit... Our results seem to suggest that non-gravitational forces are required to make 2P/Encke." - On the origin of the unusual orbit of Comet 2P/Encke, Levison et al. (2006)[1]

As comets go Encke is quite unique in that its orbit does not appear to be perturbed by Jupiter. It's orbital period is observed to be decaying by ~2.38 hours per orbit - presently 1,204 days(3.3 years) per orbit.[2][3]

I did a simple regression of the orbital period back through 18.5ky (assuming that its orbital decay has been unperturbed and linear). Numbers in the last two columns in bold indicate the correlation coefficient between Encke's orbital period and the IV an V planetary harmonics respectively. Values closer to 1 would be periods during which Encke's visits would have been more likely to synchronize with planetary harmonics. Correlations >0.75 are highlighted in shades of red.[4]

## Encke [1]

The Tunguska Event happened June 1908 when 2P/Encke was near to us. Encke always near passes us in June or October.

JPL have 2P/Encke at closest approach to Earth on July 12, 2030.

## Tracking previous encounters

We cannot calculate comets back more than a couple of thousand years. Their orbits are too heavily perturbed by the gas giants for reliable long term ephemeris calculations. [1]
