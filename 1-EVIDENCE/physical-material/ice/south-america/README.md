## An Andean ice-core record of a Middle Holocene mega-drought in North Africa and Asia (hard copy here)

"An ice core from the Nevado HuascaraÂ´n col in the Cordillera Blanca of northern Peru
contains high-resolution time series of dust concentrations and size distributions since the end of the last
glacial stage. A large dust peak, dated ~4500 years ago, is contemporaneous with a widespread and
prolonged drought that apparently extended from North Africa to eastern China, evidence of which
occurs in historical, archeological and paleoclimatic records. "
