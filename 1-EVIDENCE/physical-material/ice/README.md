# Ice

There's some bond event data overlaid with predicted ECDO dates in `EVIDENCE/solar-system`.

## Bond Events

Bond events are North Atlantic ice rafting events that are tentatively linked to climate fluctuations in the Holocene. Eight such events have been identified. Bond events were previously believed to exhibit a roughly c. 1,500-year cycle, but the primary period of variability is now put at c. 1,000 years. [2]

There is a nice timeline from the Wikipedia page:

## Ice Rafting [3]

Ice rafting is the transport of various materials by ice. Various objects deposited on ice may eventually become embedded in the ice. When the ice melts after a certain amount of drifting, these objects are deposited onto the bottom of the water body, e.g., onto a river bed or an ocean floor.[1][2] These deposits are called ice rafted debris (IRD) or ice rafted deposits. Ice rafting was a primary mechanism of sediment transport during glacial episodes of the Pleistocene when sea levels were very low and much of the land was covered by large masses (sheets) of ice. The rafting of various size sediments into deeper ocean waters by icebergs became a rather important process. Ice rafting is still a process occurring today, although its impact is significantly less and much harder to gauge.

## Camp Century Ice Core

"The long-term trend was removed from both curves by applying a binomial high-pass filter. The resulting curves... are very similar; for example, the prominent maxima of the tree-ring record at ~2800 BC, 1900 BC, 700 BC, 300 BC, AD 800, Ad 1100 and AD 1700 (Maunder Minimum) are also found in the 10BE-based model curve."

## Gas giants grand cycle harmonic and bond event data

![gas giant harmonic](img/gas-giant-bond-event.jpg "gas giant harmonic")

There is a 4627 year gas giant master cycle. If you divide it by 5, and break time down into intervals, every fourth coincides with a potential ECDO event.

It is referenced against historical bond event (ice-rafting) data.

## Speculation on melting ice caps

It would require centuries - possibly a millennium or more to completely melt Antarctic's ice sheet at the equator. 30 million gigatonnes of ice is roughly 5-6 times the mass of Australia's exposed (above sea level) land. Only a tiny fraction of it is going to melt during 20-40 years of nuclear-type winter, even at the equator. Same goes for Greenland. Probably be too cold for any deep ice to melt. Think snowpiercer.

If S2 persists for 3700 years, then surely there is no reason for Antarctica/Greenland to have all the ice and the poles during S2 to have none?

That sort of narrows it down to 2 options:

1. Ice fully melts each cycle
2. S2 doesn't persist for nearly as long as S1

If logic dictates that even 3700 years is not nearly long enough to melt the ice, then that's fairly conclusive proof that S2 is shorter than S1.

## Antarctic ice-core temperature dataset [1]

I found an Antarctic 800ka raw ice-core temperature dataset. Here's the last 20ky plotted against the harmonics.

The complete 800ky record set fairly obliterates the "unprecedented warming" narrative. It's been much warmer (and colder) in the past. This core spans from the surface (now) right down to 3260m (800ky).
