# Ice

As with many of these so called "historical events", what happens is that since we weren't actually there to witness the events in the past, some narrative story is constructed that matches the available evidence. Bond events (ice rafting + RCC (rapid climate change)) are no different - these events are reverse engineered from proxy signals. It's best to dive into the actual proxy signals to be able to develop a more granular level of analysis.

What the signals show is climate change (recorded in ice cores, tree rings, and sediment cores, along with pollen and fossils in them) along with "ice-rafted debris" that signify "glacial advances", evidenced by combinations of rock and biomass debris, erosion, and erratics.

## Bond Events [2]

"Bond events are North Atlantic ice rafting events that are tentatively linked to climate fluctuations in the Holocene. Eight such events have been identified. Bond events were previously believed to exhibit a roughly c. 1,500-year cycle, but the primary period of variability is now put at c. 1,000 years."

"The North Atlantic ice-rafting events happen to correlate with episodes of lowered lake levels in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States,[7] the weakest[clarification needed] events of the Asian monsoon for at least the past 9,000 years,[8][9] and also correlate with most aridification events in the Middle East for the past 55,000 years (both Heinrich and Bond events)."

There is a nice timeline from the Wikipedia page:

## Ice Rafting [3]

Ice rafting is the transport of various materials by ice. Various objects deposited on ice may eventually become embedded in the ice. When the ice melts after a certain amount of drifting, these objects are deposited onto the bottom of the water body, e.g., onto a river bed or an ocean floor.[1][2] These deposits are called ice rafted debris (IRD) or ice rafted deposits. Ice rafting was a primary mechanism of sediment transport during glacial episodes of the Pleistocene when sea levels were very low and much of the land was covered by large masses (sheets) of ice. The rafting of various size sediments into deeper ocean waters by icebergs became a rather important process. Ice rafting is still a process occurring today, although its impact is significantly less and much harder to gauge.

## Oxygen 18 [4]

If I understand it, warmer periods will have more O18 in rain and thus ice cores, so this would occur in the leadup to a flip as the oceans get heated. I'm not sure what would happen after the flip. I assume that the volcanic ash would cause the earth to become colder for a couple of years, reducing O18 levels... but when the ash clears, and the magnetic field is weak, not sure how the earth would react.

### Understanding Oxygen Isotopes

- **Oxygen-16** is the lighter, more common isotope of oxygen, while **oxygen-18** is heavier and less common.
- During warmer periods, more \(^{18}\)O evaporates and ends up in precipitation, so a higher proportion of \(^{18}\)O ends up in the ice.
- Conversely, during colder periods, less \(^{18}\)O evaporates and therefore the ice will have a lower \(^{18}\)O ratio, dominated by the lighter \(^{16}\)O isotope.

### Interpreting the Ratios

- **Higher \(^{18}\)O ratios** generally indicate warmer climates, as more of this isotope is present in precipitation at higher temperatures.
- **Lower \(^{18}\)O ratios** suggest colder climates, as the heavier isotope does not evaporate as easily in cooler temperatures.

## Gas giants grand cycle harmonic and bond event data

![gas giant harmonic](img/gas-giant-bond-event.jpg "gas giant harmonic")

There is a 4627 year gas giant master cycle. If you divide it by 5, and break time down into intervals, every fourth coincides with a potential ECDO event.

It is referenced against historical bond event (ice-rafting) data.

## Speculation on melting ice caps

It would require centuries - possibly a millennium or more to completely melt Antarctic's ice sheet at the equator. 30 million gigatonnes of ice is roughly 5-6 times the mass of Australia's exposed (above sea level) land. Only a tiny fraction of it is going to melt during 20-40 years of nuclear-type winter, even at the equator. Same goes for Greenland. Probably be too cold for any deep ice to melt. Think snowpiercer.

If S2 persists for 3700 years, then surely there is no reason for Antarctica/Greenland to have all the ice and the poles during S2 to have none?

That sort of narrows it down to 2 options:

1. Ice fully melts each cycle
2. S2 doesn't persist for nearly as long as S1

If logic dictates that even 3700 years is not nearly long enough to melt the ice, then that's fairly conclusive proof that S2 is shorter than S1.

## Antarctic ice-core temperature dataset [1]

I found an Antarctic 800ka raw ice-core temperature dataset. Here's the last 20ky plotted against the harmonics.

![](img/ice-core-data.jpg)

The complete 800ky record set fairly obliterates the "unprecedented warming" narrative. It's been much warmer (and colder) in the past. This core spans from the surface (now) right down to 3260m (800ky).

## Are ice core temperature proxies reliable?

Just did a quick dive into ice-core temperature proxies. It seems that an ECDO type event would completely disrupt the reliability of this proxy, as just about everything that is known to generate erroneous results would happen during such an event.
