The OG "bond event" paper.

"The most conspicuous evidence of variations in the North Atlantic’s Holo- cene climate comes from the same three proxies that we used to document ice-raft- ing in the North Atlantic during the last glaciation (7). One proxy is the concentra- tion of lithic grains, defined as the number of grains with diameters greater than 150 mm in 1 g of core. At both sites we found a series of increases in grain concentrations, which, although of much smaller magnitude than those of the last glaciation, are distinct and reach peak values several times that of the ambient grain concentrations (Fig. 2)."

"The other two proxies are petrologic tracers, defined as the percentages of cer- tain types of lithic grains. One of the tracers is fresh volcanic glass, which comes from Iceland or Jan Mayen, and the other is hematite-stained grains, mostly quartz and feldspar, that come from sedimentary depos- its containing red beds (Fig. 3) (7). During each of the lithic events, both tracers dis- play prominent increases well above the 2s counting error (Fig. 2) (8)."

"Hence, contrary to the conventional view, the North Atlantic’s Holocene cli- mate must have undergone a series of abrupt reorganizations, each with sufficient impact to force concurrent increases in de- bris-bearing drift ice at sites more than 1000 km apart and overlain today by warm, large- ly ice-free surface waters of the North At- lantic and Irminger currents. The ice-rafted debris (IRD) events exhibit a distinct pac- ing on millennial scales, with peaks at about 1400, 2800, 4200, 5900, 8100, 9400, 10,300, and 11,100 years ago."

## Information on past solar activity and geomagnetism from Be in the Camp Century ice core

"The long-term trend was removed from both curves by applying a binomial high-pass filter. The resulting curves... are very similar; for example, the prominent maxima of the tree-ring record at ~2800 BC, 1900 BC, 700 BC, 300 BC, AD 800, Ad 1100 and AD 1700 (Maunder Minimum) are also found in the 10BE-based model curve."
