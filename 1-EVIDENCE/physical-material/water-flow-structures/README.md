# Water flow structures

Have some in North Sudan, Altai mountains (Russia), France, Argentina, and Chile.

## English channel megafloods

Beneath the water of the English Channel lies evidence of two megaflood events.

## Rolling hills of the Palouse [2]

"While the majority of scholars support the wind-borne origin of the Palouse loess formations, the minority position advocating for a water-laid origin is supported by substantial geomorphological and sedimentological evidence. The presence of buried paleosols, alluvial loesses, and hydrological features like perched water tables provide compelling arguments for reconsidering the role of water in the formation of these distinctive landscapes." [1]

Spectacular. After many hours now of going through megaflood literature and looking at hundreds of erosion and accretion photos, I'd say that that is pretty much without a doubt the result of alluvial accretion and erosion by water.

Another pic. It seems fairly well accepted that this entire area in WA was deluged (albeit that the uniformitarians insist that the water came from ice lakes breaking out). The entire state bears the marks of water.

## Nebraska

In Nebraska, some 400km northeast of Pike's Peak is an area of more than 16,000 square miles of what appear to be mega current ripples, averaging 1.6km between peaks, and 50-60m depth (30km sample). These are of similar size to those seen in Sudan and Mauritania.

The Loup River lies to the southeast of the Nebraska megaripples, and can be clearly seen as the downstream drainage basin from the sand hills when viewed on a digital elevation map. In Channel Patterns and Terraces of the Loup Rivers in Nebraska (1964) we find observations of the Elba Terrace, a 120 foot thick floodplain alluvial deposit laid down around or after the YDB (with two lesser, later ones laid on top of it nearer to the river's present course).
