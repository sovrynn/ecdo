# Water flow structures

Have some in North Sudan, Altai mountains (Russia), France, Argentina, and Chile.

## English channel megafloods

Beneath the water of the English Channel lies evidence of two megaflood events.

## Rolling hills of the Palouse [2]

"While the majority of scholars support the wind-borne origin of the Palouse loess formations, the minority position advocating for a water-laid origin is supported by substantial geomorphological and sedimentological evidence. The presence of buried paleosols, alluvial loesses, and hydrological features like perched water tables provide compelling arguments for reconsidering the role of water in the formation of these distinctive landscapes." [1]

Spectacular. After many hours now of going through megaflood literature and looking at hundreds of erosion and accretion photos, I'd say that that is pretty much without a doubt the result of alluvial accretion and erosion by water.

Another pic. It seems fairly well accepted that this entire area in WA was deluged (albeit that the uniformitarians insist that the water came from ice lakes breaking out). The entire state bears the marks of water.

## Palouse Falls

Here is a park called Palouse Falls, you can see what looks like multiple washes or perhaps different strata layers that resisted the water in different ways?

## Taklamakan Desert, China

May just be sand dunes. Coords (40, 86.3).

Massive flows. The terracing would seem to suggest changes in flow direction between erosion events. Seiche action perhaps. Illustrations from Megaflooding on Earth and Mars || Channeled Scabland morphology (2009) https://t.co/ucsrkslXiz https://t.co/U06AIWdhCM

This is in agreement with the ECDO moment of inertia relative to the water. Video coming soon. https://t.co/HEYaKVeWss

Those look a lot like mega current ripples to the North and West of Newgrange, running coast to coast. Anyone know of a good LiDAR source for Ireland? https://t.co/MRKJkKWMAl
