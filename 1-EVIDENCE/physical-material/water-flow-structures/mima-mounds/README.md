# Mima Mounds

I was thinking about mima mounds today and had the thought as I was using a sander on a large piece of plywood watching the saw dust vibrate and collect in little clumps... I wonder if the mima mounds were formed from vibration?  

Just searched it up and... sure enough someone else has already had this thought.

"In 1990, a researcher named Andrew Berg claimed something else entirely: The Mima mounds, he decided, stemmed from earthquake waves. Using a plywood board layered with silt, Berg simulated the vibrations from quakes with a hammer and found he could create mounds “nearly identical to those found in the field.”"

Andrew Berg's theory explained in more detail here:

Unlike catastrophists, I think uniformitarianists have a hard time imagining earthquakes violent enough to form these.
