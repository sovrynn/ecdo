## Marcellus Shale Gas Field in Appalachian Basin

Came across this article on the formation of the Marcellus Shale gas field in the Appalachian Basin. Interesting it states it was formed when the area was at 15o to 30o south latitude which is where the area would be in S2...        https://co2coalition.org/2012/10/04/bloomin-algae-how-paleogeography-and-algal-blooms-may-have-significantly-impacted-deposition-and-preservation-of-the-marcellus-shale/

## Dating of Hydrocarbons in the Gulf of Mexico

The Age of Oil. In Science (24 October 1952), Paul Smith reported on the radiocarbon dating of oil deposits in the Gulf of Mexico: "Ages of 11,800-14,600 ±1400 years were obtained for the hydrocarbons extracted from several sections of the Grande Isle core of recent sediments. A composite carbonate sample from the entire core proved to be 12,300±1200 years old, and the non-extractable organic matter, which comprises a major portion of the original organic content, had an average age of 9,200±1000 years."
