## Illumetsa crater field

The Illumetsa crater field in southeastern Estonia. impact dated to ±7400 YBP, on the V harmonic interval. Loc: 57°57'45.38" N  27°27'38.43" E

## The age of the Kaali meteorite craters and the effect of the impact on the environment and man: evidence from inside the Kaali craters, island of Saaremaa, Estonia 

"AMS dating of terrestrial macrofossils from these sediment layers places the age of the impact at 16901510 B.C."

Kaali Craters. "Saarse et al. (1991) radiocarbon dated the near-bottom lake sediments of the Kaali main crater from a bulk sample of calcareous gyttja over-lying the dolomite debris and proposed an age of 1740–1620 BC." Loc: 58°22'22.08" N  22°40'09.78" E

## Vredefort Impact Structure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_impact_structure

The unusually mineral rich composition of the crust here probably has something to do with the LLSVP intrusion and the Vredefort crater which exposed some of what was below. Agreed on the alternate concepts - I find valuable knowledge in most areas of inquiry, especially if its something new to me.

## The Tollman's used best guess...

The Tollman's used best guess derivations for the oceanic impact locations based upon written and oral histories describing the event. Note the South American strike estimation, and what appears to be a 2,500km long E-W impact path in the ocean floor between the two continents. https://t.co/zEtVefnyFe

## Extraterrestrial impact ejecta found in...

Extraterrestrial impact ejecta found in the gills of fish that died in the Chicxulub impact event. This is a fascinating paper. Strong evidence for catastrophic extinction level impacts. https://t.co/8tHPgqgxjX https://t.co/972Q07Q7AH

## This comet and its companions...

This comet and its companions have been convincingly cast as the the actors in the Younger Dryas impact/airburst event. https://t.co/MZ6GvCebpA https://t.co/3cf9EHkRj6

## YDB Field

### Could this mass aerial bombardment...

Could this mass aerial bombardment of the northern hemisphere 12.5ky ago have imparted sufficient energy to destabilize the Earth, thus commencing the oscillation which has continued to this day? This would sensibly align with a pyramid construction date of around 9-10ky ago.
