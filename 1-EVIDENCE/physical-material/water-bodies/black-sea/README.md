# Black Sea Outflow, 6200 BC - 5500 BC

## William Ryan

Apparently the OG Black Sea deluge researcher. He has produced research from 1997 all the way up till very recently. His original thesis was around 5600 BC, which he revised to 6200 BC in 2003.

1997 paper (hard copy here): https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/s0025-3227(97)00007-8

"influx commencing later at 7150 yr BP and initiated by a cascade of saltwater pouring into a partly-emptied Black Sea lake following the breaching of an intervening barrier."

William Ryan, Black Sea, 2003: Catastrophic Flooding of the Black Sea (hard copy in this folder)

"There is a compelling, but not irrefutable, possibility that the Black Sea experienced a catastrophic saltwater flood at 8.4 ky BP."

## EXTREME FLUCTUATIONS OF THE BLACK SEA LEVEL IN NEOEUXINE HOLOCENE AS THE ALTERNATIVE OF CATASTROPHIC FLOOD HYPOTHESIS

What I see here is three events where the Black Sea level rise noticeably outpaced the world sea level rise - 9200 BC, 7100 BC, and 3000 BC. The 9200 BC could potentially be split up into two peaks of 10,300 BC and 8800 BC, and there are potentially two other outpacings around 4800 BC and 1200 BC.
