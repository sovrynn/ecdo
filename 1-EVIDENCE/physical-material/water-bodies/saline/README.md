Significant ocean isn't directly on the rotation path, but as you can see, the land in front of it on the rotation path is a flat plain offering little resistance for water. It wouldn't take much of an extra jolt to splash the water above the Andes. Alternatively, it may have been inundated on a potential quick rotation from S2 back to S1.
