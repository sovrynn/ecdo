# Soil Organic Matter

Interesting correlation between DEM and soil organic matter.

Under 5% = Black, Above 30% = White:

The areas with the most organic material are in white. The Tundra areas and others close to sea level are the richest. And then, extremely high areas, for no very clear reason, are richer than the soil of the Amazon.

One way to have such an organically rich layer is for it to never have been "washed".

Soil map:
- Under 5% = Black
- Above 30% = White

DEM Map:
- Under 200m / 577ft = Black
- Above 3.500m / 11.400ft = White

This align with the green areas in the midle of the desert:
