## Abstract
This research explores the Earth's magnetic field through a geosystemic approach, which considers the planet as an interconnected system. Using nonlinear tools like entropy, the study identifies chaotic and ergodic properties of the geomagnetic field and investigates extreme events such as jerks and polarity reversals. Evidence suggests the Earth's magnetic field may be approaching a critical transition, potentially leading to a geomagnetic reversal.

## Introduction
The Earth's dynamic nature and the interactions among its subsystems create a complex system. This study focuses on understanding the geomagnetic field's recent changes and the possibility of an imminent global transition. The decline in the dipole moment, particularly in the southern hemisphere, suggests potential polarity shifts. Traditional multipolar approaches fail to fully explain these dynamics, necessitating a holistic geosystemic methodology.

## Methodology: Tools and Concepts
1. **Geosystemics**:
   - Emphasizes self-regulation, nonlinear coupling, and emergent behaviors.
   - Relies on entropy and information theory to study irreversible Earth processes.

2. **Shannon Entropy and Information**:
   - Quantifies the degree of organization or complexity in the geomagnetic field.
   - Lower Shannon Information indicates higher chaos and unpredictability.

3. **Geomagnetic Field Analysis**:
   - Uses entropy to identify chaotic behaviors and potential reversals.
   - Investigates temporal trends in geomagnetic information over millennia.

## Key Findings
1. **Chaotic and Ergodic Behavior**:
   - The recent geomagnetic field exhibits higher chaos compared to the past.
   - Ergodicity is confirmed, simplifying analysis by allowing time-domain studies.

2. **Geomagnetic Jerks**:
   - Detected as abrupt changes in the field's secular variation.
   - More frequent in recent times, suggesting increased instability.

3. **South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)**:
   - A significant dip in magnetic field strength, growing since 1590.
   - Correlates with global sea level rise (GSL), suggesting interconnected processes.

4. **Critical Transition Hypothesis**:
   - Both SAA and GSL exhibit trends indicative of systems approaching tipping points.
   - Predicted critical time (~2033-2034) marks potential onset of irreversible changes.

## Implications
- The Earth's magnetic field is more chaotic and potentially nearing a global transition.
- The SAA's expansion and its link to sea level rise highlight significant planetary changes.
- These findings suggest the beginning of a long-term geomagnetic reversal process.

## Conclusions
The study provides compelling evidence of an imminent change in the Earth's geomagnetic regime. While exact timelines remain uncertain, the critical point for initiating polarity reversal processes is estimated around 2033-2034. Future data from advanced missions like ESA's Swarm will be crucial for validating these results.
