Something I'm going to do is create a 1590 - present geomagnetic field visualization. Not sure why I haven't seen this online.

I'm sure I can find it actually.

But it shouldn't be too hard to create some kind of 2d gradient using this tech, and create either a timelapse animation or a series of images using python.
