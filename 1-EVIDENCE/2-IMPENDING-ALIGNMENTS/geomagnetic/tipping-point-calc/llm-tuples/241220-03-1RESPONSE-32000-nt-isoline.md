The paper mentions that the 32,000 nT isoline for the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) was chosen because it is the lowest value in the oldest epoch available in their data set (De Santis et al., 2013b). This means that the threshold was likely selected to ensure continuity and comparability of measurements over time, starting from the historical records available.

However, the paper does not provide a detailed scientific justification for why this specific threshold of 32,000 nT (versus a slightly higher or lower value) was chosen beyond its occurrence as a boundary in older data. The reasoning seems to be practical and historical:

    The value aligns with the geomagnetic field intensity that could be consistently traced across historical models.
    It serves as a fixed reference point to track the SAAâ€™s changes in size and intensity over time.

If you're seeking a deeper physical or theoretical reason for this choice, it may not exist explicitly in the paper. The choice of a threshold like 32,000 nT is often pragmatic, meant to standardize measurements and facilitate analysis over long periods.
