Tell me more about the gauss coefficient model for the geomagnetic field. How are these evaluated? Every iteration of the IGRF model has multiple candidate submissions which are evaluated. How are these evaluated? If there are 1000 data points that the model needs to be fitted to, what prevents overfitting? Can't you just make a model with 1000 coefficients that perfectly maps to each one?
