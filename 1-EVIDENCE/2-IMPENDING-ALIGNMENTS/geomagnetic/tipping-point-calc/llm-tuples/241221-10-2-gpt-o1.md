First, let’s restate the problem in simple terms:

- You have geomagnetic field data (from gufm1 for 1590–1980 and IGRF-14 for 1900–2025) at or near Earth’s surface.  
- You want to define the boundary of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) as the region where the total field intensity is below 32,000 nT.  
- You recognize that simply thresholding \(B < 32,000 \; \mathrm{nT}\) worldwide might capture more than one contiguous region of “low field.” You want to isolate the SAA specifically.

Below is some guidance on how researchers typically proceed and what approaches are available.

---

## 1. How is the SAA often defined in the literature?

Different groups use slightly different numerical thresholds and altitudes. However, the methodology is generally the same:

1. **Compute the total magnetic field strength** \(F\) at a given altitude (for example, at Earth’s surface, or at satellite orbit altitudes).
2. **Identify regions** where \(F < F_{\text{threshold}}\), e.g., \(F_{\text{threshold}} = 30,000\)\(\text{–}32,000\) nT.
3. **Pick the contiguous region** in the South Atlantic sector.

Many scientific papers (e.g., dealing with the SAA hazard to satellites) simply define the SAA by specifying a bounding box in latitude/longitude, then take the region inside that box where \(F < F_{\text{threshold}}\). That bounding box is usually something like (roughly) from about 100°W to 40°E in longitude, and from 0° up to –60° in latitude, though the specifics vary.

Thus:

> **Short answer:** yes, the usual approach is effectively a “contiguous region” or “largest cluster” approach, often constrained geographically, using a threshold on total field strength.

## 2. Handling more than one patch of “low” field

It is indeed possible (especially in older epochs and certain times in the future) that another region of the globe might momentarily have total field < 32,000 nT. For instance, there could be an area in the northern hemisphere that dips slightly below that threshold. Usually, this region will be either:

- Much smaller in area, or  
- Located far from the known SAA longitude/latitude range.

Hence to capture **only** the SAA, researchers apply one of these methods:

1. **Geographic bounding:** Restrict your domain to something like:
   \[
   \text{lat} \in [-60^\circ, 10^\circ], \quad \text{lon} \in [-90^\circ, 30^\circ].
   \]
   Then identify the region (or regions) within that bounding box with \(F < 32,000 \; \mathrm{nT}\). The largest connected patch is taken to be the SAA.

2. **Flood-fill or cluster analysis starting from the minimum point:**  
   - Identify the global minimum in \(F\). That will almost certainly be in the southern Atlantic sector for Earth’s modern (and historical) field.  
   - Perform a flood fill or cluster detection outward from that minimum until you cross the 32,000 nT boundary.  
   - This yields a single contiguous region, presumably the SAA.

3. **Check contiguity**: If you simply apply \(F < 32,000\) nT over all longitudes, you might get multiple disconnected “patches.” You can run a 2D cluster labeling (e.g., with an 8-neighbor or 4-neighbor connectivity algorithm), find the cluster(s), and simply pick the largest cluster or the cluster that is centered near South America.  

Which method is used often depends on how precise or how general you want your SAA definition to be.

---

## 3. Scientific conventions

There is no single, universal “international standard” that says “use exactly 31,500 nT at 550 km altitude, with bounding box from X to Y.” Different agencies (NASA, ESA, NOAA, etc.) or even different research groups can adopt slightly different altitudes, thresholds, or bounding coordinates depending on the question they’re addressing (satellite orbit safety, cosmic ray flux, historical reconstructions, etc.).

Nonetheless, the **common** approach is:

1. **Choose a threshold** that captures the anomaly in a stable and convenient way (32,000 nT is indeed typical at Earth’s surface for the modern field).  
2. **Use a 2D cluster or flood-fill approach** to isolate the patch around South America.  
3. **Optionally** restrict by a bounding box if needed.  

Since you are working from the surface field, you can do this directly on the model output grid. If you later want to compare your results with satellite papers that define the SAA at higher altitudes (like 400–600 km), you’d just compute the field at those altitudes (using the same spherical harmonics or an updated model for that altitude).

---

## 4. Practical tips for a “sandbox” calculation

1. **Grid your data**: Typically, you’d compute \(F\) on a latitude–longitude grid (for instance, 1° or 2° spacing) using your chosen model (gufm1 or IGRF).  
2. **Threshold**: Mark all grid points where \(F < 32,000 \; \mathrm{nT}\).  
3. **Cluster labeling**:
   - Perform a 2D connected-component analysis.  
   - Determine which cluster is the largest or which one is centered around South America.  
4. **Store that cluster** as your “SAA patch” for that epoch.  
5. **Surface area**: If you want the area, you can sum up the approximate area of each grid cell that is part of the SAA. (For a 1°×1° cell, you can approximate area = \(\mathrm{(R_E^2)} \times \mathrm{deg2rad}\) factors, or use something like the Authalic or any equal-area projection to be more precise.)

**Example using Python** (pseudocode-ish):

```python
import numpy as np

# Suppose lat, lon are 1D arrays covering the Earth
# B is a 2D array with the field intensities from your model

threshold = 32000

# 1) Mask out everything above 32000
mask = (B < threshold)

# 2) Label connected regions
import scipy.ndimage as nd
labeled_regions, num_features = nd.label(mask)

# 3) Identify region that is "the SAA"
#    Could do it by bounding box or by picking the largest region

sizes = nd.sum(mask, labeled_regions, range(1, num_features+1))
largest_label = np.argmax(sizes) + 1  # label is 1-based

# 4) The SAA region
saa_mask = (labeled_regions == largest_label)

# 5) Calculate surface area
#    e.g. approximate area of each grid cell
area_per_cell = compute_area_of_cell(lat, lon)  # handle spherical geometry
saa_area = np.sum(area_per_cell[saa_mask])
