In the paper, the authors utilize both the GUFM1 and IGRF models to analyze the geomagnetic field. Specifically:

### Combination of GUFM1 and IGRF
- They used the **GUFM1 model** (which provides a continuous geomagnetic field representation from 1590 to 1990) to study long-term trends in the geomagnetic field, especially in relation to the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) and secular variation.
- The **IGRF model** (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) was used for more recent data, extending from 1990 onwards, to ensure the continuity of the timeseries through 2010.
- The authors essentially merged these models to provide a cohesive analysis spanning 1590 to 2010, allowing for both historical and recent observations.

### Approach
- For early historical periods, the GUFM1 model served as the primary dataset. It relied on historical magnetic observations, including navigation records and archeomagnetic data.
- For more recent and precise measurements, such as satellite observations, the IGRF model was incorporated to improve accuracy.

### Shifts in Data Reliability
The paper acknowledges **phase shifts** in data quality over time:
- **Before 1800**: Data relied heavily on sparse and less precise historical observations, leading to larger uncertainties.
- **Post-1800**: Data quality improved significantly due to better measurement techniques and increased global coverage.
- **Mid-20th century**: Satellite-based measurements introduced another significant improvement in reliability and resolution.

### Impact on Analysis
- The blending of GUFM1 and IGRF ensured that long-term trends (e.g., the growth of the SAA) were consistent and accounted for changing data quality.
- However, the authors were careful to consider uncertainties in early data when interpreting long-term trends and extrapolations, particularly when linking historical trends to future tipping points.
