# How Did They Infer Geomagnetic Field Strength Before 1830?

Before the advent of **absolute intensity measurements** in the 1830s, the strength of the geomagnetic field was not directly measured. Instead, it was **inferred** using a combination of methods:

---

## 1. Historical Data: Declination and Inclination
- **Declination**: The angle between magnetic north and geographic north.
- **Inclination**: The angle of the magnetic field relative to the horizontal plane.
- These provide only the **directional components** of the geomagnetic field, not its absolute intensity.

---

## 2. Assumption-Based Intensity Inference
- For the **earliest epochs** in the GUFM1 model, the absolute field strength was **estimated indirectly**:
  - **Dipole Dominance Assumption**: The Earth's magnetic field is assumed to be primarily dipolar, and the dipole strength was inferred from directional data and later measurements.
  - **Trend Extrapolation**: Known trends in geomagnetic field strength from later epochs (e.g., post-1830) were extrapolated backward in time.

---

## 3. Archaeomagnetic and Geological Data
- **Archaeomagnetic Data**:
  - Fired materials (e.g., pottery, volcanic rocks) retain a "snapshot" of the geomagnetic field's direction and **relative intensity** when last heated.
  - By analyzing these materials, both direction (declination and inclination) and relative intensity can be reconstructed.
- **Sedimentary Records**:
  - Sediments record geomagnetic directions but provide less reliable intensity data.

---

## 4. Linear Extrapolation of Intensity (Pre-1840)
- The **first Gauss coefficient (g₁⁰)**, representing dipole strength, was **linearly extrapolated** backward before 1830.
- This extrapolation was based on observed trends in the dipole moment during the historical period.
- Intensity values for the earliest periods in GUFM1 are therefore **best estimates**, not direct measurements.

---

## 5. Limitations of Inferred Intensity
- The inferred field strength for epochs before 1830 has inherent **uncertainties** due to:
  - Reliance on directional data alone.
  - Sparse or regionally constrained archaeological records.
  - Limited methods to verify inferred intensities.

- As a result, the **accuracy and resolution** of the GUFM1 model's intensity values decline for earlier epochs.

## Conclusion
Before 1830, the **strength of the magnetic field** in the GUFM1 model was **not measured directly**. Instead, it was **inferred** from directional data (declination and inclination), extrapolated trends, and assumptions about dipole dominance. This introduces uncertainties, but the model still provides a valuable approximation for studying long-term geomagnetic field behavior.
