# The GUFM1 Geomagnetic Model (1590–1990)

The GUFM1 geomagnetic model reconstructs the Earth's magnetic field over four centuries (1590–1990) using historical data, archaeological records, and modern back-projection techniques. Here's how this is achieved:

---

## 1. Historical Observations (Direct Measurements)

### Ship Logs
- **Compass Directions**:
  - Mariners in the 16th century and beyond recorded compass directions (declination) and, in some cases, inclination as they navigated.
  - These observations provided data on how the magnetic field varied spatially and temporally.
  - The reliance on magnetic compasses for navigation made these records widespread and systematic by the late 1500s.

### Magnetic Observatories
- Magnetic observatories began appearing in the late 17th and 18th centuries, providing more consistent and localized measurements of geomagnetic field components.

## 2. Archaeological and Geological Records

For times when direct measurements are sparse or unavailable, the GUFM1 model incorporates indirect data sources:

### Archaeomagnetism
- **Fired Materials**:
  - Bricks, pottery, and volcanic rocks retain a record of the Earth's magnetic field at the time they were last heated.
  - By analyzing these materials, researchers can reconstruct the geomagnetic field's direction and intensity at specific locations and times.

### Sedimentary Records
- Some sediments align with the Earth's magnetic field during deposition, preserving a record of past geomagnetic directions and intensities.

## 3. Modeling and Back-Projection

### Spherical Harmonic Analysis
- The GUFM1 model uses spherical harmonic coefficients to mathematically represent the Earth's magnetic field.
- These coefficients are constrained by historical and archaeological data to reconstruct the field at various epochs.

### Interpolation and Extrapolation
- Where measurements are sparse (especially in the early part of the model's timeline), the field is reconstructed using physical constraints and patterns derived from better-documented later periods.

### Linear Extrapolation
- For certain field components, such as the dipole moment, linear extrapolation of trends (e.g., rates of change) is used for the earlier periods, particularly before the mid-19th century when absolute intensity measurements began.

---

## 4. Verification and Uncertainty

### Cross-Validation
- Archaeological and sedimentary records are compared against historical measurements to validate the model's reliability.
- The resolution and accuracy decrease for earlier epochs due to limited data and reliance on indirect records.

### Error Margins
- The uncertainties are higher for earlier time periods (e.g., pre-1700), where data density is much lower.
- Researchers caution that the model’s accuracy is best after 1840, when more systematic and high-quality measurements became available.

## Conclusion: Back-Projection and Sparse Data

The GUFM1 model relies on a mix of direct measurements, archaeological and geological data, and back-projection techniques to reconstruct the geomagnetic field. Before 1830, the field is predominantly inferred rather than directly measured, and the model integrates physical assumptions and extrapolations to fill gaps. While this introduces uncertainties, it provides a coherent framework for studying long-term geomagnetic trends.
