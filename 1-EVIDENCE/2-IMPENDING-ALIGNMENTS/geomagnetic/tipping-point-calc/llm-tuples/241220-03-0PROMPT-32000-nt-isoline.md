I'm trying to figure out why 32000 nt is used as the threshold for the south atlantic anomaly. The wikipedia page cites an angelo desantis paper, but I want to know the actual reason why. In one of his papers, he says this was the "lowest value in the old epoch". I want you to read the following paper to see if he explains why. If he doesn't mention it, do you know why? Here's the full paper:

1Abstract
Geosytemics is a way to see and study the Earth in its wholeness, together with the eventual
couplings among the subsystems composing our planet. This paper will provide this view for the
Earth’s magnetic field, reviewing most of the results obtained in our recent works. The main tools
used by geosystemics are some nonlinear quantities, such as some kinds of entropy. Through them,
it is possible to: a) establish the chaoticity and ergodicity of the recent geomagnetic field in a direct
and simple way; b) indentify the most extreme events in its history, as the most rapid and the
slowest ones, i.e. jerks and polarity changes (reversals or excursions). In particular, regarding the
latter phenomena, with the help of these entropic concepts and together with the use of the theory of
critical transitions, some clues can be given for a possible imminent change of the geomagnetic
field dynamical regime.
Key words: Geosytemics; Geomagnetic field; Chaos, Ergodicity; Global Transition.
1. Introduction
Earth is an ever-changing planet. This statement is obvious if we take into due account some
important processes happening in our planet, i.e., growing population and, consequently, pollution;
climate change; biodiversity and resources reduction; greater weakness of the present society
against disasters caused by geohazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, etcetera.
Our planet is a complex system constituted by numerous subsystems interacting each other (Skinner
and Porter, 1995). For this reason, the understanding of our planet in its whole complexity is a
challenging task.
2Here, we will deepen the study of an important property of Earth, i.e., the geomagnetic field,
and will then try to prove or to reject the hypothesis that this field is going toward a global
transition. In addition, we will try to find whether and how other processes interact with this field.
More in detail, recently a lot of interest has been dedicated to how the present geomagnetic field is
quite distinct from the field of the recent past. Gubbins (1987) found that the southern hemisphere
gives the largest contribution to the present decrease in the dipole moment, which is directly related
to the intensification and southward movement of a pair of patches of reverse flux under South
Africa: this state could eventually lead to a polarity change in terms of a geomagnetic reversal or
excursion. Through an inversion of MAGSAT and Ørsted satellite magnetic data, Hulot et al.
(2002) confirmed Gubbins (1987) results, identifying a reverse magnetic flux under the southern
hemisphere. Rajaram et al. (2002) and De Santis (2007) found a rapid fall of the recent geomagnetic
field in Antarctica. Jackson (2003) identified some intense equatorial flux spots on the top of the
Earth's core, as manifestation of a high variability in the core. Bloxham et al. (2002) explained the
frequency increase of the number of jerks, which are very rapid variations in the change of the slope
of the secular variation with time scale of around 1 year, as likely due to an increased excitation of
torsional waves towards the end of the last century. Gubbins et al. (2006) evidenced that the recent
geomagnetic field increased its rate of decay from 1840 by about 5% per century even though they
attributed this fact to an erratic aspect of the present field. De Santis et al. (2004) proposed that the
present geomagnetic field could be in a chaotic state next to a geomagnetic reversal or excursion,
with significant possible implications in the biosphere, in the atmosphere and in some other
components of the Earth system (Constable and Korte, 2006). All the above papers express some
evidence for an irregular, likely chaotic,
state of the present geomagnetic field, with some
possibilities for an imminent change of magnetic polarity.
3A problem that we can meet when we investigate in detail some aspects of the geomagnetic
field, concerns with the conventional multipolar approach, i.e. dipolar /non-dipolar representation of
the geomagnetic field potential: this approach may not provide clear information regarding the
dynamical and configurational properties of the whole field, because the huge dipolar contribution
mostly obscures the results taken from the other multipoles. Therefore, other kinds of analyses must
be exploited by following a more holistic approach to the problem. This approach looks at the field
for its wholeness rather than at each specific and minute part of it (e.g., De Santis, 2009, 2014). This
is exactly what we will do in this paper: we will try to use the concepts of Geosystemics with the
purpose of having a more complete view of the geomagnetic field system. To do it, we will
establish and compare the variation of the Shannon Information and some other quantities in order
to affirm that the present geomagnetic field behaviour is consistent with a possible current planetary
transition in terms of a significant change of its main characteristics (energy, dipole moment, related
core dynamics, etc.) possibly going toward an excursion or even a reversal.
This article is a review of our recent contributions to the understanding of the recent
geomagnetic field. In the next section we will introduce the concept of Geosystemics, and then we
will define some useful mathematical tools like the Shannon Entropy (and Information) and its
application to the geomagnetic field. We will also illustrate a new technique for the detection of
geomagnetic jerks. Then, we will study in detail an important feature of the geomagnetic field, i.e.,
the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) and will relate this feature with another physical quantity, the
global sea level (GSL), strictly connected with climate.
2. Geosystemics
4The Geosystemics studies the Earth system from a holistic point of view, looking with particular
attention at self-regulation phenomena and relations among the parts composing the Earth, together
with the possible trends of change or persistence of the specific system or sub-system under study
(De Santis, 2009, 2014). This approach puts at its centre the concepts of entropy and information
content: to characterise the world, not only energy and matter are important, but also information
(Bekenstein, 2003). In particular self-regulation, nonlinear coupling, emergent behaviour,
irreversibility have to be taken into the due account since these are important constituents of the
planet, so they must be matter of study for Geosystemics. In particular, the information exchanged
and the increased entropy allow us to better understand those irreversible processes occurring in the
Earth’s interior. Geosystemics has the objective to observe, study, represent and interpret those
aspects of geophysics that determine the structural characteristics and dynamics of our planet and
the complex interactions of the elements that compose it. Some universal nonlinear tools are
fundamental for Geosystemics: among many, we will focus on information and entropy. It will be
also important an approach based on multi-scale/parameter/platform observations in order to cover
and monitor the particular sub-system of Earth under study as much as possible. Although this latter
aspect will not be considered in this review, it is a fundamental issue of geosystemics, because there
is no better way to understand the behaviour of a complex system than looking at it from as many
perspectives as possible.
3. Shannon Entropy and Shannon Information
The concept of Shannon Entropy H(t) (Shannon, 1948) is an important tool which can be used for
the space-time characterization of a dynamical system. In the case of a system characterized by N
possible independent states, this entropy is defined in a certain time t as follows:
5N
H (t ) = −∑ pn (t ) ⋅ log pn (t )
(1)
n =1
where pn ( t ) represents the probability of the system to be at the n-th state. For convenience, we
impose ∑ n pn = 1 and log pn = 0 if pn = 0 to remove the corresponding singularity.
In literature we can find a wide number of physical interpretations of the Shannon Entropy. Among
these, we choose the simplest one: it is a non-negative measure of our ignorance about the state of
the system of concern. The Shannon Entropy has a great importance in studying and interpreting
the behaviour of complex systems like Earth in general, and geomagnetic field, in particular. On the
other hand, we find in literature also the Shannon Information, I(t), which is simply related to H(t)
as I(t)=- H(t). It is a negative quantity that measures our knowledge on the state of the system when
we know only the distribution of probability p(t) (Beck and Schlögl, 1993). In practice, this quantity
denotes our decreasing ability to predict the evolution of the system into the future.
4. Shannon Information and Entropy of the geomagnetic field
The Shannon Information has been already applied to the present (De Santis et al., 2004) and
recent past (De Santis and Qamili, 2010) geomagnetic field, B(t), that can be defined at and above
the Earth’s surface as the negative gradient of a scalar potential V(t). In turn, this potential can be
expressed, at a given time t, by a spherical harmonic expansion in space characterized by a set of
Gauss coefficients, g nm (t ) , hnm (t ) , with n=1, … N degrees and m=0, ... n orders of the potential field
expansion. We can define the Shannon Information I(t) of the geomagnetic field as:
N
I (t ) = − H (t ) = ∑ pn (t ) ⋅ log pn (t )
(2)
n =1
6pn(t) is the probability of having a particular n-th multipole rather than another, and is calculated as

In this formula (c nm ) 2 = ( g nm ) 2 + ( hnm ) 2 and a= 6371.2 km. <B2> and <Bn2> are the mean squared
amplitudes over the sphere with radius r of the total field and of the field due to the n-th multipole,
respectively (Lowes, 1966). Although the brackets <…> denote strictly spatial averages of the
squared field strength over the terrestrial sphere, actually they are also time averages because any
global model of the geomagnetic field, for the way it is constructed, is a smoothed averaged model
in time and space. Therefore, the definition of the Shannon Information (2) with the probabilities
(3) assumes an ergodic geomagnetic field: in the next section we will confirm this property of the
field. It is important to underline the fact that the time behaviour of the Shannon Information for
the geomagnetic field can help us in understanding a possible chaotic scenario for the dynamical
system that generates and sustains the field, in terms of geodynamo models (Chillingworth and
Holmes, 1980). The slow temporal variation of the geomagnetic field with time scales from years to
thousand years, is called secular variation (SV): mathematically, it is defined as the time derivative
of the field. Therefore, we can introduce also an analogous Shannon Information for the SV i.e.,
I(SV) (we relax the dependence with time, that is implicit) where the corresponding probability pɶ n
will be similar to that of eq. (3) but (cnm ) 2 will be replaced by (cɺnm ) 2 = ( gɺ nm ) 2 + ( hɺnm ) 2 :

De Santis et al. (2004) showed that the recent geomagnetic field is in the particular situation that
pn ≈ pɶ n , which is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a geomagnetic reversal or excursion.
In Figure 1 some synthetic examples are given for different Shannon Entropy H values (De Santis
and Qamili, 2008). These configurations are given in terms of the normalised Shannon Entropy H*
(with value between 0 and 1) as:
H* =
H
I
=
H max I min
(5)
with Hmax=-Imin= log N. In this figure, the example with entropy H*=0.3 represents the real case of
the present geomagnetic field deduced from IGRF-11 model at 2010 (Finlay et al., 2010), while the
others are synthetic cases. From these examples it is clear that the Shannon Entropy provides a way
to measure the degree of complexity of the field spatial configuration: the higher the Shannon
Entropy (or the lower Shannon Information), the more all probabilities are equally possible, and,
then, the more complex the derived spatial configuration of the field will be. The interpretation of
this is that when the Shannon Information is low there is a lower degree of organization for the
system under study (see for instance the recent review by Balasis et al., 2013). For this reason the
corresponding Shannon Entropy is also called spatial or configuration entropy (e.g., Rodrìguez-
Iturbe et al., 1998). Of course, when we apply these concepts to the real geomagnetic field, we
recognise that the value of the information quantity must be referred to a specific reference radial
distance, r. For instance, while the normalised entropy of the present real geomagnetic field is
8around 0.3 at the Earth’s surface, it becomes 0.8 at the core mantle boundary (CMB). This is normal
because the field is more complex going toward the sources, and the increase of entropy denotes an
increase of complexity.
The temporal trends of I(t) of the real geomagnetic field for the last 7000 years, at Earth’s
Surface and at CMB, by using CALS7K (Korte and Constable, 2005), CALS3K (Korte et al., 2009)
and IGRF-11 (Finlay et al., 2010) global models, are shown in Figure 2 (De Santis and Qamili,
2010). All these global models are based on a spherical harmonic representation of the field. The
trends in this figure show also the estimated error bars associated to CALS7K moving from a
maximum of 33% at 5000 BC to 3% at 1950 AD. In order to allow the “contact” of the I(t) of
CALS7K at the CMB with that of IGRF-11, here we show the possible effect of the spectral
damping typical of CALS7K model (at the Earth’s surface I(t) is practically unaffected). Our results
indicate that the present Shannon Information is much lower than the Shannon Information of the
past, i.e., the present field is much more chaotic than the field of the past.
When a process is ergodic and chaotic, I(t) can be related with the Kolmogorov entropy or K-
entropy that represents the rate of loss of information, by (Wales, 1991):
K =−
dI
dt
(6)
This quantity measures the degree of unpredictability of the future evolution of the system between
successive points on the trajectory in the phase space (Beck and Schlögl, 1993; Buchner and
Zebrowski, 1998). An alternative definition of the K-entropy can be given also as the sum of all
positive Lyapunov exponents of the dynamical system (Schuster and Jung, 2005). A practical
consequence is that after a characteristic time τ=1/K, the system’s behaviour can no longer be
predicted. Figure 3 shows the K-entropy of the geomagnetic field as derived from equation (6) from
95000 BC to present at Earth’s Surface and at CMB. Here, the K-entropy is derived as a linear fit to
each 100-year interval at Earth’s surface and at CMB; each single IGRF-11 value is given in the
plots as a star. The K-entropy of the present field is rather high with respect to the past (De Santis
and Qamili, 2010). Although we cannot exclude that some marginal contribution to this feature
could be due to insufficient data in the past when compared with the present “abundance”, we think
that the effect is mostly real, because our definition of the K-entropy is based on the dynamical
variations of the Shannon Information of global models with realistic spatial power spectra, so with
a reliable repartition between dipolar and non-dipolar parts.
5. Ergodicity of the recent geomagnetic field
In a general case, the information quantities introduced in the previous section by the equations (3)
and (6), should be estimated in the phase space. However, if we prove that, apart from being
chaotic, the geomagnetic field is also ergodic, i.e., time average of the original signal is equal to the
density average in the phase space (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985), then the phase space reconstruction
will not be necessary, and we can perform all the analysis in the time domain. In that case, if we
want to investigate the nonlinearities present in a system, we can simply perform a nonlinear
forecasting approach in the time domain. Taking into account the chaotic properties of the
geomagnetic field, any small change ε of the initial orbit in the phase space propagates
exponentially with time, i.e., ε ( t ) = ε0 exp ( K ⋅ t ) where K is the above defined K-entropy.
Let us consider a generic measure ρ of the dynamical system moving in the phase space Ω. For
every continuous function ϕ, a dynamics f is called ergodic if it has the same behaviour averaged
over time as averaged over phase space and the space average is weighted by the invariant measure
10ρ (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). Under general assumptions, this can be expressed mathematically
with the following equation:
T
1
ϕ  f t ( x0 )  dt = ∫ ρ (dx)ϕ ( x)
T →∞ T ∫
0
lim
(7)
This means that if the system is ergodic, after a certain time evolution, the system is no longer
dependent on its initial state x0 (Egolf, 2000). In the case of the geomagnetic field, the invariant
measures are the K-Entropy and its inverse value <τ> =1/K, i.e., the limiting mean time of
prediction.
Considering all the global geomagnetic models present in literature, we could have large
errors if we extrapolate the geomagnetic field outside their typical time of validity (De Santis et al.,
2011, 2013a). These errors can be estimated from a comparison between the predicted and
definitive part of each model. More precisely these errors can be calculated by means of Gauss
coefficients from the formula (Maus et al., 2008):
N
n
ε = ∑ ( n + 1) ∑ ( cnm ) − ( cnm ) 
pred
def 

n =1
m =0
2
(8)
An example of the trend of these errors is given in figure 4, where one 10-year segment from 1965
to 1975 and seven 5-year segments from 1975 to 2010 taken from IGRF-11 global model have been
considered. De Santis et al. (2011) have analyzed also other global models like CHAOS (Olsen et
al, 2014), CM4 (Sabaka et al. , 2004), GUFM1 (Jackson et al., 2000), WMM (Maus et al., 2010),
POMME (Maus et al., 2005), obtaining the same results (but they are not shown here). Since the
IGRF-11 model gives a constant predictive field, in this analysis we have used the CM4 model as
predictive part in order to avoid this problem. For visual convenience, we have imposed the same
11initial time. This means that each exponential growth will have an offset of –ε0. In this case the
formula for the calculation of the errors, substituting the K-entropy with its inverse τ, will be:
ε ( t ) = ε 0 exp ( t τ ) − ε0 = ε0 ( exp ( t τ ) − 1)
(9)
In this figure, for each segment we indicate the corresponding τ values together with their
associated errors. As result, all the segments show a clear exponential growth with characteristic
mean time <τ>=5.9±2.3 years. We can conclude that the exponential temporal divergence of the
errors between several couples of predictive and definitive global geomagnetic models supports a
chaotic state of the present geomagnetic field with no reliable prediction after around 6 years (see
De Santis et al., 2011). This result confirms the nonlinear analysis performed in the phase space by
De Santis et al. (2002) and has direct consequences in repeating magnetic surveys and updating
global and regional models of the geomagnetic field (De Santis et al., 2013a). The total agreement
of these analyses made in the phase space and in time domain, confirms the ergodicity of the
geomagnetic field (De Santis et al., 2011).
6. Jerks as chaotic fluctuations of the geomagnetic field
Geomagnetic jerks have been generally identified in geomagnetic observatory time series (e.g.
Courtillot et al., 1978; Mandea et al., 2010). The fact that some timescales of jerk occurrences are
overlapping with those of the solar activity (e.g. sunspots cycle of almost 11 years) complicates the
clear identification of jerks in the geomagnetic field time series. A better alternative was presented
recently. In this section we will describe the results obtained by Qamili et al. (2013) who extended
the nonlinear forecasting approach in the time domain, over the last 400 years, period covered by
12GUFM1 (Jackson et al., 2000) global model with the objective to re-interpret the geomagnetic jerks.
We analyze the temporal behaviour of the differences between predicted and definitive values of the
geomagnetic field calculated from this model in order to find periods more or less chaotic than
others. The predicted/definitive comparison is made over successive 10-years segments, moving at
steps of 1 year. The problem is that GUFM1 model does not give a predictive field. This part was
calculated by extrapolating the prior 10-year secular variation, into the subsequent 10 years and
compared them with the real GUFM1 field values for the same period of time. Each of the analyzed
segments shows an evident exponential growth with characteristic time of predictability
τ ≈ 6 ± 2.5 years. The temporal fluctuations of τ value around its mean linear trend from 1600 to
1980 are shown in Figure 5. What is clear from this figure is that the past field is less predictive
than the recent one, because the number of accentuated negative fluctuations of τ increases with
time. A simple explanation of this result could be the progressive improvement of the data quality
used to build the GUFM1 model. Around this general trend we have found some interesting
fluctuations, i.e., periods where the geomagnetic field is more chaotic (smaller time of predictability
τ) and also periods where the field is less chaotic (greater time of predictability τ). Checking
carefully all the epochs where the τ-value becomes suddenly lower with respect to the values that
surround it (a sort of V-shape in the temporal behaviour of τ), we find that most of these epochs
corresponds to already known geomagnetic jerks (epochs evidenced by arrows but considering an
uncertainty of a few years for each event), detected by other authors (Mandea et al., 2010 and
references therein). But not all the chaotic fluctuations correspond to already known geomagnetic
jerks. This could be because the techniques introduced till now for the identification of geomagnetic
jerks, where most of them are applied to direct measurements, had not been able to detect all these
features produced by the geomagnetic field. For this reason, here, we detect a number of new
13(undetected till now) geomagnetic jerks (events evidenced by blue arrows in Figure 5). As
conclusion, we can say that geomagnetic jerks appear in those epochs where the geomagnetic field
is more chaotic. It is interesting to notice that the more recent field is characterised by more
frequent jerks. During the applied analysis we have identified also some short periods where the
field appears less chaotic than usual but this aspect will need more investigation to understand the
corresponding origin.
7. Toward a global geomagnetic transition?
Some previous (e.g., Gubbins, 1987; Hulot et al., 2002; De Santis 2007) and more recent (De
Santis et al., 2013b) results show that it is very important to investigate the geomagnetic field of the
southern hemisphere, since it contributes more to the overall decaying trend of the geomagnetic
field. Could this be considered as a symptom that the Earth’s magnetic field is going toward a
global transition? We will see that this hypothesis is fostered by the presence of one of the most
important features of the present geomagnetic field, i.e., the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA; figure
with H*=0.3 in Figure 5). We follow here the reasoning of the recent article by De Santis et al.
(2013b).
The SAA is a significant depression in the total intensity of the present geomagnetic field that has
been persisting at least for the last 400 years. It is generally interpreted as the Earth’s surface
expression of a magnetic vortex present in the outer core, as a component of a strong reversed
magnetic flux (Olson and Amit, 2006). During the last 400 years, the SAA has changed in space
and in time. If we consider its extension from 1590 to present using GUFM1 and IGRF-11 models
(we have considered the extent of the 32000 nT isoline because it is the lowest value in the oldest
epoch), we obtain the trend shown as a thick curve in Figure 6. The continuous and accelerating
growth of this anomaly is evident, especially during the last 250 years. We could ask whether this
14acceleration happens just by chance or not. Fig. 7 shows the real acceleration of the SAA in the last
400 years (red curve) compared with 10,000 simulations (blue curves) where all SAA increments
have been randomly shuffled. Green curves represent the maximum acceleration (lower green
curve) and deceleration (upper green curve). The real acceleration of the SAA stands clearly at the
lower limit of the possibilities (maximum acceleration), supporting the case that the present
situation is not occurring just by chance.
De Santis et al. (2012) found that also another, apparently unrelated quantity, the global sea
level rise (GSL; Jevrejeva et al., 2008) has followed the same growing trend during the last three
centuries (thin curve in Figure 6). To assess a real correlation between the two time series, some
statistical tests have been performed, i.e., Spearman correlation test (Davis, 1986) and Kullback-
Leibler Entropy (Kullback and Leibler, 1951). The results taken from the statistics, (both with or
without a trend removal) confirm the high correlation between SAA extension area and GSL (see
De Santis et al., 2012, 2013b). Although correlation does not always mean causation, we should
consider this possibility as a serious hypothesis. In that case, what physical mechanism could be
behind the observed correlation? De Santis et al. (2012) propose three possible mechanisms (two
external and one internal):
1. an increase of the SAA area facilitates the entrance of charged particles from space. As result
we have a warmer atmosphere, which implies a consequent melting of major ice caps
(Antarctica and Greenland) that finally causes a global increase of sea level;
2. a possible reduction of the ozone layer in the upper stratosphere over the South Atlantic
region can modify the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere and hence can cause
changes in the weather and climate patterns, including cloud coverage;
153. both SAA and GSL time variations could share the same common internal cause, i.e., a
convective dynamism in the outer core causes a variation of the magnetic field and an elastic
deformation at the Earth’s surface (Greff-Lefftz et al., 2004).
An interesting question concerns with the best temporal function that fits the SAA surface area
change in time. We will see that this function follows the typical behaviour in time of critical
systems, i.e. those complex systems approaching a critical transition.
The deformation (or energy release) y(t) of a material that approaches a failure satisfies the
following empirical equation (Voight, 1989):
ɺɺ
y = ayɺ α
(12)
where a and α are two empirical constants. The latter is an exponent that measures the degree of
nonlinearity and normally takes values between 1 and 2. We can extend the concept of the failure of
a material to critical systems approaching their tipping point, i.e. the time when the system
undergoes a dramatic (usually abrupt) change of its dynamical properties. In this way, eq. (12)
assumes a more universal importance. Indeed, the solutions of equation (12) have been largely
applied for the prediction of different critical systems like volcanic eruptions (Voight, 1988),
earthquake main failure (Bufe and Varnes, 1993), financial crashes (Sornette, 2003), magnetic
storms (Balasis et al., 2011), etcetera. Integrating equation (12) for α≠1, we obtain a first-order
equation whose solution takes the form of a power-law increase with time:
y = A + B ( tc − t )
p
(13)
where tc represents the time to failure or critical time of the system under study, p=[(2-α)/(α-1)] is a
power-law exponent (usually less than 1); A>0 and B<0 are parameters to be found from the
16experimental data. Vandewalle et al. (1998) introduced a logarithmic function in alternative of the
power-law form, i.e., y = A + B ln ( tc − t ) . Sornette and Sammis (1995) propose a more generalised
solution which is decorated by a log-periodic function. Thus we can write:
y (t ) = A + B ln(tc − t ) ⋅ {1 + D ⋅ cos[2π f ln(tc − t ) + φ ]}
(14)
D is the magnitude of the log-periodic fluctuations around the acceleration growth, f is the
frequency of the fluctuations, φ is the phase shift.
We applied equation (14) over SAA (Figure 8) and GSL (Figure 9) trends (De Santis et al., 2013b).
The equation (14) fits very well both the considered time series, with very high correlation
coefficient r (in both cases r>0.98). Since original GSL data set is very noisy (especially the oldest
values) before the fit we averaged the data every 5 years (black circles in Fig.9). Regarding the
estimation of the critical time tc, we find practically the same time, i.e., tc ≈ 2034±3 yrs for SAA and
tc ≈ 2033±11 yrs for GSL (estimated errors are just statistical, as they could be even larger than
indicated; see the end of this section). Also the D and f parameters are very similar in both SAA and
GSL fits, indicating that the fluctuations affect the acceleration in almost the same way in both
physical quantities. In practice, the A parameter of the SAA fit corresponds to the value of the SAA
area at the critical time (actually at tc-1 year), that, in this case, will reach more than 50% of the
whole Earth surface. Alternative fits with functions with a comparable number of coefficients (such
as, for instance, a 5-degree polynomial in time,) are equally possible, however they are much more
unrealistic outside the data they use. All these results suggest that the same trend of these quantities
is not a mere coincidence, and, probably, both these systems are behaving as dynamical systems
close to a critical point.
17However some words of caution are necessary. Any fit made with the function of (14) is rather
instable when the critical point is far, so it needs as more data as possible before to provide some
stable result: in general, the fit converges to a stable result as the data approach the critical transition
(e.g. see Sornette et al., 2004 for landslide predictions). To have some quantitative idea of the
stability (or instability) of this kind of analysis, we apply the fit in subsequent segments of the SAA
dataset, in particular from 1590 to 1960, then from 1590 to 1965, and so on, till the last epoch of
2010, and for every fit we keep note of the prediction , tpred, of the critical transition. This means
that in every analysis we truncate the data at some time tmax < tc and use only the data up to tmax. We
choose the SAA data instead of GSL data because the latter are much noisier and reducing the
points of the fit would provide very unstable results. We can then consider difference ∆t = tpred –
tmax, i.e. between prediction (tpred) and epoch ( tmax ) at which the prediction is made for the last 50
years (Fig. 10). A linear fit over ∆t would predict ∆t=0 at around 2060, indicating that the most
recent prediction (made at tmax=2010) of tc ≈ 2034 yrs (or, alternatively, the error of ±3 yrs) is
probably underestimated. However, in the last 15 years ∆t almost stopped to decrease, so also this
linear prediction must be taken with some caution (Fig. 10). What we can affirm is that the analysed
time series has been so far behaving as a critical system, but we will need more time and more data
before to completely confirm this result. This is also due to the fact that a critical system reveals its
criticality as it approaches more the critical point. It is for this reason that log-periodic functions are
called “sloppy” functions (e.g. Brée et al., 2013).
8. Conclusions
In this paper we made an overview of the complex characteristics of the present Earth’s magnetic
field by means of the Geosystemics approach, reviewing most of the results obtained in our recent
works. More precisely, useful tools like Entropy and Information have been applied to the present
18and to the recent past geomagnetic field in order to derive important information regarding the
corresponding dynamical system originating in the outer terrestrial core. Moreover, the temporal
evolution of an important feature of the present geomagnetic field, the South Atlantic Anomaly, has
been deeply investigated. Since the main objective of Geosystemics is to study the Earth system
from the holistic point of view, together with the SAA we have also analysed another physical
quantity, the GSL, and studied its possible correlation with the geomagnetic field. After all these
analysis we can conclude that the present geomagnetic field is more chaotic than the one of the past.
In addition, there are many intriguing aspects that encourage us to suggest that the present
geomagnetic field is rather special and a possible imminent change of geomagnetic polarity could
be not so unexpected. We find the interesting result that both SAA and GSL can be described by a
critical system evolution, with similar critical time that can be interpreted as “the point of no
return” for both the whole geomagnetic field and GSL. We do not interpret the critical time as the
exact moment of a geomagnetic reversal, because the typical diffusion time of the Earth’s core
would require a few thousand years, we rather consider tc as the time when the irreversible process,
that will drive the magnetic field to change its polarity, will start. To make a simple figurative
analogy, consider the case in which we play with a ball near a deep well: if the ball falls into the
well, the critical point will be the moment at which its centre of gravity is beyond the border of the
well and not the time the ball will touch the bottom. About the exact time of the critical transition
we warned about its uncertainty, mostly due to the instability of the fit of expression (14) over any
experimental data. For this reason, further investigation is still demanding in the near future to
confirm or confute the found results. In particular, the recent ESA Swarm mission (Olsen and
Haagmans, 2006) of three twin satellites (launched on 22 November 2013) with precise magnetic
sensors aboard will be an unprecedented occasion to verify the present results with great accuracy.
