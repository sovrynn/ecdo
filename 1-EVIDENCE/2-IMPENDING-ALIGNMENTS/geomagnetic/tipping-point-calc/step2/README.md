This part is another difficult part. I'll have to:
- figure out that tipping point equation
- fit it to the data, also getting confidence intervals
- account for possible overfitting, noise, or margins of error that could skew the result I'm getting

I do think it's ridiculous that they modeled the global sea level using the tipping point equation. What do they think is going to happen, global sea level to infinity? And if that fit gave such a "high statistical confidence" then how much personal confidence should we take in the adjacent SAA tipping point fit?
