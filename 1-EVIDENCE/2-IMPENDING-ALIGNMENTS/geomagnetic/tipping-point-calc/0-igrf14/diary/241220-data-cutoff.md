# GPT Response

IGRF models are updated every five years and each release provides both a "definitive" main field model based on actual observations (historical and recent satellite/ground data) and a predicted secular variation model that extends five years beyond the release epoch. For IGRF-13, for example, the model provides a definitive main field up through 2015, a main field model for the year 2020, and then a predicted secular variation from 2020 to 2025.

IGRF-14, which would be the next generation after IGRF-13, is expected to follow the same pattern:

- **Definitive Data Epoch:**  
  IGRF-14 would be released near the end of 2024 or beginning of 2025 and would use the most reliable and up-to-date magnetic field observations available up until roughly the end of 2024. By the time of its release, the "definitive" main field model would be established for the 2020 epoch (revisiting and refining previous data with any improved techniques or late-arriving data).

- **Transition to Predicted Data:**  
  The "new" reference epoch for IGRF-14 will be 2025. The model will provide a main field for 2025 based on accumulated observational data through late 2024 (and possibly early 2025), considered as definitive as possible at that point. From 2025 onward (i.e., from 2025.0 to 2030.0), the changes in the main field are not observed but rather projected based on secular variation estimates.

### In essence:

- The cutoff between real-world (observed) data and projected data for IGRF-14 will be at the 2025 epoch.
- Data up to (approximately) the end of 2024 feed into the "definitive" part of the model at the 2025 reference epoch.
- The field variations beyond 2025, extending to 2030, are then predictions rather than directly observed values.

This pattern is consistent with previous IGRF releases: the definitive portion extends up to the modelâ€™s epoch year, and the secular variation for the next five years is a forecast, updated again with the next IGRF generation.
