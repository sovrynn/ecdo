# 241220 figuring out the reason for this value

I don't understand exactly why they use this value... it's mentioned in the wikipedia, but the source is another angelo desantis paper.

# Digging around

It seems like a circlejerk value selected by researchers...

The closest I've found to an actual reason, in the seminal paper:

"we have considered the extent of the 32000 nT isoline because it is the lowest value in the oldest
epoch"

So there was a certain epoch where the lowest value of the SAA was 32000 nt. What epoch would this be exactly?

# Figured it out?

ookAY I think I figured it out - I think it refers to the lowest value at the oldest year (1590 in gufm1 model, spanning from 1590 - 1990).

The fact that it's expanded so far is alarming.

# Understanding the "Oldest Epoch" and the 32,000 nT Threshold

### What is the "Oldest Epoch"?
In geomagnetic studies, the **"oldest epoch"** refers to the earliest time period for which reliable and systematic data are available. Specifically, for the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), the "oldest epoch" corresponds to historical geomagnetic field models such as **GUFM1**, which reconstruct the Earth's magnetic field from **1590 AD to 1990 AD** using historical, archaeological, and sedimentary records.

### Time Range
- **Oldest Epoch**: Starting around **1590 AD**, based on the GUFM1 model.
- **End of the Epoch**: This specific reference often focuses on the period between **1590 and 1832 AD**, as intensity data became more reliable after Carl Friedrich Gauss's introduction of absolute intensity measurements in **1832**.

### Why Use 32,000 nT as the Threshold?
1. **Historical Significance**:
   - At the beginning of the "oldest epoch" (~1590 AD), the 32,000 nT isoline was the **lowest intensity value** consistently identifiable in the SAA region.
   - This value served as a clear demarcation for the anomaly in both historical and reconstructed geomagnetic data.

2. **Consistency Across Time**:
   - Using the 32,000 nT threshold allows for consistent tracking of the SAA's spatial extent over the last 400+ years.
   - A higher or lower threshold might not have been significant or identifiable in earlier epochs.

3. **Model Accuracy**:
   - Early epochs (1590â€“1800) rely heavily on sparse historical records. The 32,000 nT isoline likely represented the most reliable and discernible boundary for identifying the anomaly with the available data.

### The GUFM1 Model and the SAA
- **GUFM1 Model**: This model integrates data from ships' logs, early magnetic observatories, and other historical records to reconstruct the geomagnetic field from 1590 to 1990 AD.
- **Evolution of Data Quality**:
   - Before **1832 AD**: Data is reconstructed primarily from historical sources with lower precision.
   - After **1832 AD**: Gauss's absolute intensity measurements significantly improved data reliability.

### Time Evolution of the SAA
- The use of the 32,000 nT isoline in 1590 allows researchers to:
  1. Observe the SAA's **spatial growth** over time.
  2. Track its **westward drift** and **intensity decay** consistently across epochs.
  3. Analyze long-term trends in the Earth's magnetic field and infer potential critical transitions.

### Conclusion
The **32,000 nT threshold** serves as a historical baseline for the SAA's extent and intensity, enabling consistent analysis of its evolution from the "oldest epoch" (1590 AD) to the present. It represents the lowest reliably identifiable value at the start of the GUFM1 model's timeline, providing a robust framework for understanding the anomaly's long-term dynamics.
