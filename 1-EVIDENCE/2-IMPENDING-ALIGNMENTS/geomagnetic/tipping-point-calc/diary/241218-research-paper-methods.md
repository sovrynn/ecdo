### Time Range of SAA Surface Area and GSL Data Used in Modeling

- **SAA Surface Area**: The time range for the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) surface area data is from **1590 to 2010**, using the GUFM1 and IGRF-11 geomagnetic field models.
  
- **Global Sea Level (GSL)**: The time range for the global sea level data is from **1700 to 2002**, based on historical records and datasets (e.g., Jevrejeva et al., 2008).

Both datasets were analyzed and fitted with log-periodic and power-law functions to predict their approach to a critical transition, with a critical time around **2034 ± 3 years** for the SAA and **2033 ± 11 years** for GSL.

# Analysis of Tipping Point in the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly)

In "Geosystemics: A Systemic View of the Earth’s Magnetic Field and Possibilities for an Imminent Geomagnetic Transition" by De Santis and Qamili, the **South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)** is a critical focus for identifying geomagnetic transitions. The specific metric used for modeling a tipping point is the **surface area of the SAA**, determined by a consistent magnetic intensity threshold.

## Key Aspects of the SAA and Tipping Point Analysis

### 1. Surface Area Definition
- The SAA's extent is measured using the **32,000 nT isoline**, which defines the boundary of the anomaly’s low-intensity region.
- This metric provides a consistent framework to track the anomaly's spatial growth over time.

### 2. Temporal Trends
- The surface area of the SAA has expanded **significantly over the last 400 years**, with particularly rapid growth in the last 250 years.
- This expansion is modeled as a critical system approaching a tipping point.

### 3. Critical Transition Modeling
- The SAA’s surface area growth is fitted using a **log-periodic power-law model**:
  \[
  y(t) = A + B \ln(tc - t) + D \cos[2\pi f \ln(tc - t) + \phi]
  \]
  where:
  - \(tc\): "Critical time" when a significant geomagnetic event is expected.
  - \(A, B, D, f, \phi\): Model parameters derived from data.
- **Critical Time (\(tc\))**:
  - For the SAA, \(tc ≈ 2034 ± 3\) years.
  - This indicates a "point of no return" for a geomagnetic transition, though not necessarily a complete pole reversal.

### 4. Chaotic Behavior
- The SAA’s growth is linked to **chaotic dynamics** in the geomagnetic field, driven by reverse magnetic flux patches in the Earth’s outer core.
- Observations suggest deterministic behavior deviating from random noise, consistent with systems nearing critical transitions.

## Relation to Tipping Point Theory
- **Acceleration** in the SAA’s growth acts as an early indicator of critical transitions.
- **Log-periodic oscillations** superimposed on the SAA's growth reflect the complex dynamics typical of systems nearing criticality.
- The SAA’s surface area serves as a proxy to measure the progression of the geomagnetic field toward instability.

## Conclusion
The analysis identifies the SAA as a key indicator of the Earth's geomagnetic system's approach to a tipping point, potentially leading to a geomagnetic excursion or reversal. The critical time of 2034 ± 3 years suggests an impending transition in the geomagnetic field dynamics.

# Global Sea Level

In addition to the **SAA surface area**, the authors use the **Global Sea Level (GSL)** as a second metric for identifying and modeling a tipping point. The GSL time series is analyzed for its correlation with the SAA, and both metrics are fitted using log-periodic power-law models to predict their approach to critical transitions.

### Key Points Regarding GSL
- **Correlation with SAA**:
  - A significant correlation between the growth of the SAA surface area and GSL rise is established through statistical tests such as the Spearman correlation test and Kullback-Leibler entropy.
  - The authors hypothesize that this correlation may be due to shared underlying mechanisms, such as convective dynamism in the Earth’s core or external influences on climate.

- **Critical Transition Modeling**:
  - Both the GSL and SAA are modeled using the same log-periodic function:
    \[
    y(t) = A + B \ln(tc - t) + D \cos[2\pi f \ln(tc - t) + \phi]
    \]
  - The critical time (\(tc\)) is nearly identical for both metrics, with \(tc ≈ 2034 ± 3\) years for the SAA and \(tc ≈ 2033 ± 11\) years for GSL.

- **Physical Interpretation**:
  - The GSL rise may be influenced by mechanisms linked to the SAA, such as increased atmospheric warming due to charged particles entering Earth's atmosphere or core-mantle dynamics leading to deformation of the Earth's surface.

Thus, GSL serves as a complementary metric alongside the SAA surface area to predict tipping points in Earth's geomagnetic and geophysical systems.
