Sooo idk how feasible it will be to use this thing. It's limited in functionality.

It's usable for sure but I'll just have to do some fancy engineering.

Tbh I'm not sure if any of the provided model compute options will support the calculation I need out of the box.

# README of the python library

The code runs a simple command-line driven menu which allows spot values of the seven main field components (Declination, Inclination, Total Field, Horizontal, North, East and Vertical strength, or D,I,F,H,X,Y,Z) and their respective secular variation to be computed for a given latitude, longitude, altitude and time.

You can also specify the IGRF generation from 1 to 14 (as of November 2024).

Other options include computing a time-series of values for a location over a number of years, or computing values for a grid of latitude and longitude values for a particular date.
