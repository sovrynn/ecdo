So, on the NCEI NOAA gov website, they give the following options:

- Coefficients in a text file (probs not doing this unless I'm forced to)
- Geomag 7.0 software: Windows and Linux
- Python 3.7 package (!!)
	- this is provided in a zip file
- Fortran program
- Github repo

I'll check out the python package and the github repo first.

I also question whether this data is trustable.
