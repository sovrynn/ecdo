The **32,000 nT (nanoteslas) isoline** in the context of Earth's geomagnetic field represents a contour line that connects all points on the Earth's surface where the total intensity of the geomagnetic field equals **32,000 nanoteslas**. This value is relatively low compared to the average geomagnetic field strength at the Earth's surface (which typically ranges from about 25,000 to 65,000 nT).

### Significance in the Paper
In the paper, the **32,000 nT isoline** is used to measure and define the extent of the **South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)**. The SAA is a region where the Earth's magnetic field strength is significantly weaker than average. By tracking the area enclosed by this isoline over time, researchers can study the growth, movement, and dynamics of the anomaly, which provides insights into core processes and the geomagnetic field's evolution. 

This particular isoline was chosen because it captures the low-intensity regions characteristic of the anomaly while providing a consistent metric for analysis over the historical data range.
