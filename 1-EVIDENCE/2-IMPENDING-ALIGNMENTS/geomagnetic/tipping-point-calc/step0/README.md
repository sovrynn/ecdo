So here I'm just going to make sure I have the gufm1 and igrf 14 models working, make sure values are within reasonable bouds, calculate small bits and pieces of the final result, etc.

# What I've done

tested both the igrf14 and gufm1 tools I'll use

# What I need to do

Make sure you can access these programatically in a python script

# What I would like to do

I think it'll be cool to test the values generated by these but might not get around to it tbh
