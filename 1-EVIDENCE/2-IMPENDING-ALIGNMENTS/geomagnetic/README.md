## Laj - An impending geomagnetic transition? Hints from the past

See LITERATURE for hard copy.

"Very recently, De Santis and Qamili (2015 and references therein) have considered the evolution of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) and its progressive extension over the last 400 years. They find that there has been an acceleration in the rate at which the SAA expands. Also, fitting the surface extension of the SAA with power laws or logarithmic functions, in analogy with critical phenomena, they define a critical time tc when the SAA area will reach almost an hemisphere in the very near future (tc = 2034 Â± 3 yr AD). They interpret tc not as the exact moment of a geomagnetic reversal or excursion, but rather as the time when irreversible processes that will drive the geodynamo into a polarity change will start."

# TODO

A very good next task would be to update the De Santis, Qamili calculations for a tipping point in 2033/2034. (in progress!)
