## Herodotus, Greek historian, 440 BC account of Egypt solar flips

*"So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made the report, declaring that from the first king down to this priest of Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one generations of men, and that in them there had been the same number of chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of men are equal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations of men; and in the one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean which were added to the three hundred, there are one thousand three hundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings who arose in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence twice had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting;[127] and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been changed from its usual state, neither that which comes from the earth nor that which comes to them from the river nor that which concerns diseases or deaths."* [4]

- Herodotus (Greek Historian), An Account of Egypt, 440 BCE

After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose name was Sethos. [4, 2.141]

Sethos ruled from 1290 - 1279 BC.

341 generations of men, 30 years per generation? It could be less.

"Generally, Ancient Egyptians have married inside their social classes. The man was usually married between the ages of 16 and 20, or as soon as he chooses potential craft with the aim to earn money for his family. Women usually married at the age of about 13 years, or immediately after the puberty." [6]

Women's marriage age defines the age of generations. 341 generations of men, at 14 years per generation, gives 4774 years.

Then, from the period of 6000 BC to 1290 BC, there were two flips. Which aligns with a Noahic deluge and the 1750 BC events timeline.

## Mohenjo-Daro, Pakistan, abandoned 1700 BC - Fire & Water [3]

"Built c. 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. With an estimated population of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered for several centuries, but by c. 1700 BCE had been abandoned, along with other large cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defense against flooding. According to a theory first advanced by Wheeler, the city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times, and later rebuilt in the same location. For some archaeologists, it was believed that a final flood that helped engulf the city in a sea of mud brought about the abandonment of the site." [1] (continued in the comments...)

Mohenjo-Daro's abandonment is temporally coincident with the recorded destruction of Crete by deluge (c. 1750 BCE) and fire (c. 1700 BCE) [2]

There are thousands of square kilometers of significant stratification formations underlying the sand dunes starting 100km to the east of the site which precisely align with the ECDO [3] moment of inertia (the red line), and which are morphologically characteristic of the unperturbed laminar flow which would occur during S2>S1 in this area.

## Eridu Genesis, Sumerian Creation Myth, 3000 BCE

Just the physical tablets containing the tale date back to 1600 BC, meaning the actual event is likely much older: "The story is known from three fragments representing different versions of the narrative. One is a tablet excavated from the ancient Sumerian city known as Nippur. This tablet was discovered during the Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania in 1893, and the creation story was recognized by Arno Poebel in 1912. It is written in the Sumerian language and is dated to around 1600 BC.[1] The second fragment is from Ur, also written in Sumerian and from the same time period. The third is a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian fragment from the Library of Ashurbanipal ca. 600" [7]

"The people called Sumerians, whose language became the prevailing language of the territory, probably came from around Anatolia, arriving in Sumer about 3300 BCE... An extant document, The Sumerian King List, records that eight kings reigned before the great Flood. After the Flood, various city-states and their dynasties of kings temporarily gained power over the others. The first king to unite the separate city-states was Etana, ruler of Kish (c. 2800 BCE)." [9]

"Some modern scholars believe the Sumerian deluge story corresponds to localized river flooding at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) and various other cities as far north as Kish, as revealed by a layer of riverine sediments, radiocarbon dated to c. 2900 BCE, which interrupt the continuity of settlement. Polychrome pottery from the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 3000â€“2900 BCE) was discovered immediately below this Shuruppak flood stratum. None of the predynastic antediluvian rulers have been verified as historical by archaeological excavations, epigraphical inscriptions or otherwise, but the Sumerians purported them to have lived in the mythical era before the great deluge." [7]

## Atra-Hasis, Akkadian (Mesopotamian) epic

"Written down in the mid-17th century BCE, the Atrahasis can be dated by the colophon to the reign of the Babylonian King Hammurabi's great-grandson, Ammi-Saduqa (1646-1626 BCE) though the tale itself is considered much older, passed down through oral transmission." [10]

"Tablet II begins with more human overpopulation. To reduce this population, Enlil sends famine and drought at formulaic intervals of 1200 years." [8]

In this account, Enki is the kind god who tells the human protagonist Atrahasis about the flood.

## Gilgamesh

"The Epic of Gilgamesh was written c. 2150-1400 BCE but the Sumerian Flood story it relates is older, passed down orally until it appeared in writing." [10]

## Turkey flood myth (400 BC)

		- Frazer, Sir James G. Folk-Lore in the Old Testament, vol. 1, Macmillan & Co., London, 1919.
			- chapter 4: the great flood
	- This one cites the time as being around that of Alexander the Great (4th century BC), so the timing is a bit of an issue, but being a "story" its possibly incorrectly attributed to his time. There is however, another link to something happening in this area at the time Alex was around.

## Turkey deluge account

Not only does it describe a deluge, it specifically describes an oceanic displacement.

## Egypt

I hadn't heard of the book of Kolbrin. Some interesting descriptions about what goes on in the heavens and the land with clear parallels to the Noah story. Sounds like a destroyer arrives (Encke?), there is a micronova and earth flip causing the deluge and stars to rotate. The heat could then be from the CME arriving days later. The oceans do not rise up but crash over the mountains and fill the valleys but only lie 3 cubits above the earth. After the tumult the water drains back over 7 days. Apparently the book dates back 3,600 years.
