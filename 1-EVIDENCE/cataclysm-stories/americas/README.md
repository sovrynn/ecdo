## Peru

*"According to Montesinos, there were three distinct periods in the history of Peru. First, there was a period which began with the origin of civilization, and lasted until the first or second century of the Christian era. Second, there was a period of disintegration, decline, and disorder, introduced by successful invasions from the east and southeast, during which the country was broken up into small states, and many of the arts of civilization were lost; this period lasted more than a thousand years. Third and last came the period of the Incas, who revived civilization and restored the empire."* [2]

*"The Inca tales Montesinos assembled, attested that long before the latest Inca dynasty there had been an ancient empire. After a period of growth and prosperity upheavals suddenly befell the land… wars broke out. The king reigning at the time left Cuzco and led his followers to a secluded refuge place in the mountains called Tampu-Tocco; only a few priests remained in Cuzco to maintain its shrine. It was during that calamitous time that the art of writing was lost."* [1]

*"But he (Montesinos) recorded a version whereby the first of the chosen as a leader was a brother that bore the name of the ancestor who had led the people to the Andes, Pirua Manco (and thus the name Peru)…he had decided to build there a city… one of his half-sisters bore him a son who was called Manco Capac. It was this son who built in Cuzco the Temple of the Great God, Viracocha; and therefore it is from that time that the establishment of the empire is counted and the chronicles of the dynasties begin..."* [1]

*"“In the reign of the twelfth Capac, news reached Cuzco of the disembarking on the coast of “some men of great stature… giants who were settling the whole coast” and, possessing metal implements, were despoiling the land. After a time they began to go into the mountains; fortunately, they provoked the wrath of the Great God and he destroyed them with a heavenly fire."* [1]

*"“Relieved of the dangers, the people forgot the commandments and the rites of worship. “Good laws and customs” were abandoned… In punishment the Creator hid the sun from the land, “there was no dawn for twenty hours.” There was a great outcry among the people and prayers and sacrifices were offered at the temple until the sun reappeared. The king immediately thereafter reintroduced laws of conduct and rites of worship."* [1]

*"The fortieth Capac established the study of astronomy and astrology and determined the equinoxes. The fifth year of his reign, Montesinos calculated, was the twenty-five hundredth from Point Zero, which he assumed, was the Deluge. It was also the two thousandth year since kingship had began in Cuzco."* [1]

*"In the reign of the fifty-eighth monarch, “when the Fourth Sun was completed,” the count was 2,900 years since the Deluge. It was Montesinos calculated, the year in which Jesus Christ was born."* [1]

The wording is unclear, but it seems that in the above quote, the Deluge was 2900 years before Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was the time of the 58th monarch. Confirmed by this second source: *"Manco-Capac III., the sixtieth sovereign of this line, is supposed to have reigned at the beginning of the Christian era..."* [2].
