# Korea Myths

Korea has two interesting myths - the Dangun founding myth and the Namu Doryeong flood myth.

## Dangun (2300 BCE?)

Dangun is the myth of the founder of Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom (at least in the current cycle). Supposedly, the mother and father of Dangun, Hwanung and Ungnyeo, stayed in a cave on Mount Myohang (1909m peak) for 100 days, staying out of the sunlight, eating only garlic and mugwort. Afterwards, they descended and had a child Dangun, who established Gojoseon.

Emperor Dangun's rule is dated based on China's dates. Sources say that he ascended to the throne sometime during the 25th - 50th years of Emperor Yao's reign, which is right before the Xia Dynasty was established.

See `cataclysm-stories/asia/china` for an investigation on potential dating anomalies for Emperor Yao.

My hypothesis is that the parents of Dangun survived the ECDO event by staying in a cave on Mount Myohang.

## Namu Doryeong

It is a tale that tells of a great flood, with the survivor saving a few animals and having children with a wife to carry on humanity. Such a myth is found in many cultures.
