## Talkorigins excerpt

An uncommonly specific description of cataclysmic geological process: "The king of the water demons fell in love with the woman Ngai-ti (Loved One). She rejected him and ran away. He pursued and surrounded the whole human race with water on the hill Phun-lu-buk, said to be in the far northeast. Threatened by waters which continued to rise, the people threw Ngai-ti into the flood, which then receded. **The receding water carved great valleys**; until then, the earth had been level." [Gaster, p. 97]
