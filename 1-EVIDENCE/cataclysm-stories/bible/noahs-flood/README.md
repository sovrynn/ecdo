## Black Sea Filling - 5200 BC? [3]

"The Yahwist And The Flood Of The Black Sea":
- "The flood story is one of the most well known and most repeated apocalyptic stories throughout time.  Though, there is no evidence of an event at the time other than the sudden filling of the Black Sea basin by water flowing into it at an unimaginable rate, **archeology suggests that this event was the cause of much change about 5200 BC.** This flooding of the Black Sea may have been the basis of the flood story in Genesis."

The duration of the flood is not clear; 40 days or 150 days depending on the account. [1]

## Genesi 7:11

When Noah was 600 years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the underground waters erupted from the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky.
