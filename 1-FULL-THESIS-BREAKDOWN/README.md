# Overview

This folder is intended to be a SCIENTIFIC analysis of Ethical Skeptic's ECDO hypothesis.

A reader should be able to come away from this folder with an understanding of precisely why and how the ECDO happens and various first/second/third order effects.

There is a lot to be done here, this folder needs to be filled to the brim.

## Information that doesn't belong here

While there is bound to be overlap, adhoc evidence such as myths or frozen animals belong NOT HERE, but in the folder `2-ADHOC-EVIDENCE`.

Additionally, anecdotal evidence about the impending rotation, and predictions about it, belong NOT HERE, but in `3-MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`.

## TODO

Flesh out the following phenomena (among other things):
- State 1 vs State 2, time spent in S2
- Current poles vs new poles in S2 (Africa, Pacific)
- Temperature changes (very cold during S2)
- Bulge on equator moving
- Verification of Ethical Skeptic's thesis
