## Hydrocarbon

Another book on my reading list currently is Hydrocarbon, Edited by Vladimir Kutcherov and Anton Kolesnikov

So far very interesting and nicely busting all the false bubbles created in "standard" education on origins of gas and oil. So not only from biogenic  (decomposition of organic matter (plants and animals) buried under sedimentary layers) but far more from abiogenic origin. The book explores the fact that hydrocarbons can form from inorganic processes deep within the Earth's mantle, the role of high-pressure and high-temperature conditions in creating hydrocarbons without the need for biological precursors. Laboratory experiments and natural observations are used to support the hypothesis, suggesting that hydrocarbons could be more abundant than previously thought. Some have even said oil is the second most abundant liquid on earth just after water. https://www.intechopen.com/books/2351
