# Earth Inner Layers

*"The Earth’s core undergoes extreme exothermic change – sloughing high-latent-energy hexagonal closepack (HCP) iron from its H-layer and into the outer core where it converts to liquid face centered cubic (FCC/BCC) iron plus kinetic energy (latent heat of phase transition). Core magnetic permeability weakens and its geomagnetic dipole wanders. Earth’s rotation speeds up on a decadal basis from the loss in magnetic coupling from outer core to mantle. Earth’s rotational axial inclination also changes."* [3]

## Internal Layers

Earth has several internal layers:

These layers are of differing density, rigidity, and thickness [1]:
- **Crust**, 2.7 - 3 g/cm^3 density, 5 - 35 km thickness (5 km oceanic crust, 35 km continental) [2]
- **Upper mantle**, 3.3 - 4.0 g/cm^3 density, 660 km thickness
	- **Uppermost rigid mantle**, 100 - 200 km thickness
	- ***Asthenosphere**, semi-fluid and ductile, facilitates plate tectonics, ~300 km thickness
	- **Transition zone**, 3.8 - 4.4 g/cm^3 density, 220 km thickness
- **Lower mantle**, solid but flowing, 4.4 - 5.6 g/cm^3 density, 2260 km thickness
- **Outer core**, liquid, 9.9 - 12.2 g/cm^3 density, 2180 km thickness
- **Inner core**, solid, 12.8 - 13.1 g/cm^3 density, 1220 km thickness

Total: 12.7k km
