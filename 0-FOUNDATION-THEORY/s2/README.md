# S2

This folder is for understanding S2, which is the state of the Earth after the first ECDO rotation.

# Basics of S2

## Duration

The Great Gun-Yu flood of China, around 1900 BC, was said to have lasted 22 years. See `EVIDENCE/cataclysm-stories/asia/china`.

"I don't think that S2 is more than 20-30 years [due to] total apparent karst erosion/number of inundations." [1]

## New Geographic Pole Locations

New north pole:
- Present day location: South-Africa
- Lat/long: (-14. 31)
- Below the equator

New south pole:
- Present day location: Pacific Ocean
- Lat/long: (14, -149)
- Above the equator

## Volcanic ash

As the inner layers of the Earth, including the upper mantle which lies beneath the crust, deforms immediately to accomodate the new equatorial bulge following the rotation, we will likely see extreme volcanic activity all around the world. This would result in incredible amounts of ash (`FOUNDATION-THEORY/volcanoes`) being deposited into the atmosphere. It's not clear how long this ash would remain in the air, but the ash from the St. Helens eruption spread around the globe in two weeks, although it eventually settled down soon after.

# TODO

Investigate potential "nuclear winter" during S2, caused by changes in the core-mantle, solar minimum, and volcanic ash.
