# S2

This folder is for understanding S2, which is the state of the Earth after the first ECDO rotation.

The key factor here IMO, aside from the obvious issue of figuring out S2's orientation, is deducing the length of S2 through evidence and theory.

# Basics of S2

## Duration

"Moreover, during a short Khafre-styled reversal of say 10 to 50 bitter cold, dark, and wet years, we might not be able to detect such a Dzhanibekov rotation at all, even in ice cores." [2]

The Great Gun-Yu flood of China, around 1900 BC, was said to have lasted 22 years. See `EVIDENCE/cataclysm-chronology/asia/china`.

"I don't think that S2 is more than 20-30 years [due to] total apparent karst erosion/number of inundations." [1]

On the ostrich egg (`EVIDENCE/civilization-remnants/important-artifacts`) there's indication of a special 200-year phase.

## Weather

The 2200 BC and 6200 BC drought events seem to propose temporary periods of *dry* and *cold* weather... Is this what we may see during S2?

## New Geographic Pole Locations

New north pole:
- Present day location: South-Africa
- Lat/long: (-14. 31)
- Below the equator

New south pole:
- Present day location: Pacific Ocean
- Lat/long: (14, -149)
- Above the equator

## Volcanic ash

As the inner layers of the Earth, including the upper mantle which lies beneath the crust, deforms immediately to accomodate the new equatorial bulge following the rotation, we will likely see extreme volcanic activity all around the world. This would result in incredible amounts of ash (`FOUNDATION-THEORY/volcanoes`) being deposited into the atmosphere. It's not clear how long this ash would remain in the air, but the ash from the St. Helens eruption spread around the globe in two weeks, although it eventually settled down soon after.

# TODO

Investigate potential "nuclear winter" during S2, caused by changes in the core-mantle, solar minimum, and volcanic ash.
