# S2

This folder is for understanding S2, which is the state of the Earth after the first ECDO rotation.

## Contents

- `coastline-changes`: Predicting coastline changes in S2.

# Basics of S2

## New equator

See `FOUNDATION-THEORY/equatorial-bulge` for a detailed visualization of the new equator.

## Duration

The Great Gun-Yu flood of China, around 1900 BC, was said to have lasted 22 years. See `EVIDENCE/cataclysm-stories/asia/china`.

"I don't think that S2 is more than 20-30 years [due to] total apparent karst erosion/number of inundations." - Nobulart

## New Geographic Pole Locations

New north pole:
- Present day location: South-Africa
- Lat/long: (-14. 31)
- Below the equator

New south pole:
- Present day location: Pacific Ocean
- Lat/long: (14, -149)
- Above the equator

# TODO

Investigate potential "nuclear winter" during S2, caused by changes in the core-mantle and dust from volcanoes.

Create a map of the world after S2, showing the new position and orientation of all continents.
