## Atlantic Meridonial Overturning Circulation [1,2]

This seems to play a very big role in climate. Water gets cooled when it gets trapped near the poles, where it sinks, and gets heated when it gets trapped in the equator, where it rises.

If the Earth flipped, these would get disrupted, and form new patterns, which would contribute to shifting the climate.

For example, notice that the Pacific west coast is not humid, whereas East Asia is very humid, even though they are at similar latitudes. So, the weather is not solely determined by latitude. The local ocean and topography makes a large difference.

One thing that's for sure is that the placement of Eurasia smack on the equator will certainly change up the currents, and the Arctic region will be a lot more humid. The Pacific and Atlantic ocean currents will also get messed up as these no longer traverse vertically but horizontally. Africa would get quite dry as it moves to the north pole, which matches the 2200 BC drought.

My incomplete attempt at visualizing this:

### Factors Determining the Path of Macro Surface Currents on Earth [3]

The paths of **macro surface currents** (large-scale surface currents) on Earth are influenced by several key factors, including wind patterns, Earth’s rotation, coastline shapes, and variations in water temperature and salinity. These currents are essential for distributing heat, nutrients, and organisms globally.

#### 1. Global Wind Patterns
   - **Trade Winds**: Blow from the east in the tropics, driving surface currents westward near the equator.
   - **Westerlies**: In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds blow from the west, pushing currents in an easterly direction.
   - These wind patterns form large circular current systems, called **gyres**, in each major ocean basin (North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans).

#### 2. Coriolis Effect
   - Caused by Earth’s rotation, the **Coriolis effect** deflects moving water:
     - In the **Northern Hemisphere**, water is deflected to the **right**.
     - In the **Southern Hemisphere**, water is deflected to the **left**.
   - This deflection influences the direction of surface currents and creates the circular movement of ocean gyres, such as the clockwise North Atlantic gyre and counterclockwise South Atlantic gyre.

#### 3. Continental Boundaries and Coastline Shape
   - Surface currents are redirected along coastlines when they encounter continents, creating boundary currents.
   - For example, the Gulf Stream flows along the eastern coast of the United States before being redirected eastward across the Atlantic, while the Kuroshio Current follows a similar path along Japan’s coast.
   - Ocean basin shapes and continental arrangements guide the paths of these currents, confining gyres within specific regions.

#### 4. Temperature and Salinity Gradients
   - **Temperature Differences**: Warm water is less dense and stays on the surface, while colder, denser water sinks. Warm currents like the Gulf Stream transport heat from the equator toward the poles, while cooler currents, such as the California Current, bring colder water from higher latitudes toward the equator.
   - **Salinity Variations**: Higher salinity increases water density, influencing surface current movement. For instance, in some areas, evaporation raises salinity, increasing water density and contributing to vertical mixing that affects surface currents.

#### 5. Thermohaline Circulation and Interaction with Deep Currents
   - While thermohaline circulation primarily affects deep currents, it interacts with surface currents through **upwelling** and **downwelling** processes.
   - In regions where surface water cools and sinks, such as the North Atlantic, warm surface water from other areas is drawn in, indirectly affecting surface current paths.

## Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [4]

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ /ɪtʃ/ ITCH, or ICZ),[1] known by sailors as the doldrums[2] or the calms because of its monotonous windless weather, is the area where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough (a usage that is more common in Australia and parts of Asia).

## Wind patterns [3]

Summary of Global Wind Directions:

- Trade Winds: East to West (0°-30° latitude)
- Westerlies: West to East (30°-60° latitude)
- Polar Easterlies: East to West (60° latitude to the poles)
- Jet Streams: West to East (high altitude)
- Monsoons: Seasonally shifting directions (ocean to land in summer, land to ocean in winter)

These wind patterns are the result of the Earth’s rotation (Coriolis effect), differential heating, and pressure systems, which together shape global and regional wind flows.
