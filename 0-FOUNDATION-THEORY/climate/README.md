## Atlantic Meridonial Overturning Circulation [1,2]

This seems to play a very big role in climate. Water gets cooled when it gets trapped near the poles, where it sinks, and gets heated when it gets trapped in the equator, where it rises.

If the Earth flipped, these would get disrupted, and form new patterns, which would contribute to shifting the climate.

For example, notice that the Pacific west coast is not humid, whereas East Asia is very humid, even though they are at similar latitudes. So, the weather is not solely determined by latitude. The local ocean and topography makes a large difference.

One thing that's for sure is that the placement of Eurasia smack on the equator will certainly change up the currents, and the Arctic region will be a lot more humid. The Pacific and Atlantic ocean currents will also get messed up as these no longer traverse vertically but horizontally. Africa would get quite dry as it moves to the north pole, which matches the 2200 BC drought.

## Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [4]

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ /ɪtʃ/ ITCH, or ICZ),[1] known by sailors as the doldrums[2] or the calms because of its monotonous windless weather, is the area where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough (a usage that is more common in Australia and parts of Asia).

## Wind patterns [3]

Summary of Global Wind Directions:

- Trade Winds: East to West (0°-30° latitude)
- Westerlies: West to East (30°-60° latitude)
- Polar Easterlies: East to West (60° latitude to the poles)
- Jet Streams: West to East (high altitude)
- Monsoons: Seasonally shifting directions (ocean to land in summer, land to ocean in winter)

These wind patterns are the result of the Earth’s rotation (Coriolis effect), differential heating, and pressure systems, which together shape global and regional wind flows.
