# Dating ECDO events

There is a wide breadth of literature and research on cataclysm events, which compiles evidence from mythical cataclysm accounts, archaelogical and sediment flood remnant dating, biological traces such as extinctions or migrations, climate changes, or historical chronologoies. After perusing these, I think the correct approach is to assume that many of these cataclysms are not caused by ECDO events. For examples, comet impacts, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and solar activity variation can all cause cataclysms on their own.

Therefore, dating past ECDO events requires a calculated meshing of evidence.

## The different categories of evidence

The following can undeniably be used as evidence for an ECDO rotation event:
- specific accounts of the Sun's trajectory changing direction
- geomagnetic excursions recorded in paleomagnetic data
- temporary prolonged inundation such as that evidenced by the Khufu pyramid erosion lines, or sinking of large areas of land
- human mitigatory measures such as the Khufu observatory

The following will always occur during an ECDO event and is strong evidence of one:
- global floods, evidenced by flood remnants or flood accounts, from multiple areas of the world at the same time

The following will always/often occur during an ECDO event, but may also occur due to other reasons:
- global extinctions
- intense solar energy reaching the Earth
- earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
- climate change
- tsunamis

The major kind of event that could cause synonymous effects to an ECDO is cosmic impact events such as comet strikes.

The following preclude the existence of an ECDO event, in some capacity:
- continuous uninterrupted inhabitation without any evidence of a major cataclysm

## Dating techniques

I have come across a variety of dating techniques, some of which should be taken more factually than others:
- carbon dating
- correlation with other contemporary or chronological events
- astronomical events

What we want to avoid is one big game of cataclysm dating telephone - where people cite each other's dates as factual, adding their own error, going on and on, until we have one big noiseball of dates, with little real signal.
