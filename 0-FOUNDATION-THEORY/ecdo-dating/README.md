# Dating ECDO events

There is a wide breadth of literature and research on cataclysm events, which compiles evidence from mythical cataclysm accounts, archaelogical and sediment flood remnant dating, biological traces such as extinctions or migrations, climate changes, or historical chronologoies. After perusing these, I think the correct approach is to assume that, in the absence of a STRONG CONVERGENCE of ECDO evidence, that these cataclysms are not caused by ECDO events. For examples, comet impacts, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and solar activity variation can all cause cataclysms on their own. There will also be noise in the data as well, and cylicity that we aren't aware of yet.

## The different categories of evidence

The following can undeniably be used as evidence for an ECDO rotation event:
- specific accounts of the Sun's trajectory changing direction
- geomagnetic excursions recorded in paleomagnetic data
- temporary prolonged inundation such as that evidenced by the Khufu pyramid erosion lines, or tangentially, "sinking" of large areas of land
- human mitigatory measures such as the Khufu observatory

The following will always occur during an ECDO event and is strong evidence of one:
- global floods, evidenced by flood remnants or flood accounts, from multiple areas of the world at the same time

The following will always/often occur during an ECDO event, but may also occur due to other reasons:
- global extinctions
- intense solar energy reaching the Earth
- earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
- climate change
- tsunamis
- famines

The major kind of event that could cause synonymous effects to an ECDO is cosmic impact events such as comet strikes.

The following preclude the existence of an ECDO event, in some capacity:
- continuous uninterrupted inhabitation, large-scale civilizational happenings without any evidence of a major cataclysm

## Dating techniques

I have come across a variety of dating techniques, some of which should be taken more factually than others:
- carbon dating
- correlation with other contemporary or chronological events
- astronomical events

What we want to avoid is one big game of cataclysm dating telephone - where people cite each other's dates as factual, adding their own error, going on and on, until we have one big noiseball of dates, with little real signal.

## ECDO effects

In the leadup:
- Abyssal ocean heating
- Deep crude alkane pockets heat and release organic compound into atmosphere. Methane (CH4) rises
- Carbon-rich oceans heat up, atmospheric CO2 rises
- global ocean current speed increasing due to deep ocean heating
- rise in rainfall and potentially hurricanes/storms due to increased moisture from higher temps
- rise in seismic and volcanic activity
- magnetic field weakening

During the flip:
- magnetic field extreme weakening
- oceanic displacement, sediment deposits, fillings of bodies of water, salt water bodies forming
- significant seismic and volcanic activity
	- dust clouds from the volcanoes

S2:
- volcanic ash (9 months of darkness?), blocking out sun
- potentially dry weather due to changes in climate patterns OR weaker magnetic field
- potentially EXTREME solar energy due to weakening magnetic field (melted cities circa 1700 BC)
- localized climate changes due to changing latitude, changing ocean current and wind current topography
- magnetic orientation changes, paleomagnetic anomalies
- difficult conditions for life, narrow tree rings

Human changes:
- mass casualties from oceanic displacement, earthquakes, volcanoes
	- genetic chokepoints, extinctions
- famines from lack of food supply and farmable conditions
- mass societal disruption and destruction of structures

Eventually:
- endothermic core, cold temperatures
