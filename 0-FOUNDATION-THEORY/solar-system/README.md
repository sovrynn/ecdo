## Precession of the equinoxes

"In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity-induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. In the absence of precession, the astronomical body's orbit would show axial parallelism.[2] In particular, axial precession can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation in a cycle of approximately 26,000 years." [4]

## Milankovitch Cycles [3]

"Milankovitch cycles describe the collective effects of changes in the Earth's movements on its climate over thousands of years. The term was coined and named after the Serbian geophysicist and astronomer Milutin Milanković. In the 1920s, he hypothesized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession combined to result in cyclical variations in the intra-annual and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation at the Earth's surface, and that this orbital forcing strongly influenced the Earth's climatic patterns."

"Of all the orbital cycles, Milankovitch believed that obliquity had the greatest effect on climate, and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes. Therefore, he deduced a 41,000-year period for ice ages.[22][23] However, subsequent research[20][24][25] has shown that ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last million years have been at a period of 100,000 years, which matches the eccentricity cycle."

## 11-year Solar Cycle

The Sun has an 11-year cycle, during which it oscillates between solar maximum and minimum, and also goes through a pole flip. Over a period of 22 years, the Sun would go through two cycles, each with opposite magnetic polarities. [1]

When combined with the Gleissberg cycle, you would see the Sun transitioning from local solar maximum and minimum in between its transitions to the "global" solar maximum and minimum defined by the Gleissberg cycle.

## LLVP similar to sunspot butterfly diagram?

"Detailed observations of sunspots have been obtained by the Royal Greenwich Observatory since 1874. These observations include information on the sizes and positions of sunspots as well as their numbers. These data show that sunspots do not appear at random over the surface of the sun but are concentrated in two latitude bands on either side of the equator. A butterfly diagram (142 kb GIF image) (184 kb pdf-file) (updated monthly) showing the positions of the spots for each rotation of the sun since May 1874 shows that these bands first form at mid-latitudes, widen, and then move toward the equator as each cycle progresses." [2]

Does this happen for the same reason that the LLVPs seem to be centered around the equator?

## 1930 Meteor (Example of meteor effects)

"In August 1930 Father d’Alviano went to the Curuc-a River, near the Brazilian–Peruvian border, to carry out his annual apostolic mission. There, he discovered that the local people were terrified by fireballs and explosions that had occurred a few days before his arrival and that had let them believe that the world was at an end. Hundreds of eyewitnesses reported to the catholic missionary that at around 0800 hours on August 13, 1930, a fine red dust began to fall onto the forest and into the river; then people heard several earpiercing whistles that became increasingly loud. Fishermen on the river could see the fall of large fireballs. There were three distinct explosions, each causing earth tremors. The ash continued to fall until midday (Huyghe, 1996). Father d’Alviano concluded that a meteoroid had exploded in the Earth atmosphere, and a note to this effect appeared on March 31, 1931, in the Vatican Newspaper."
