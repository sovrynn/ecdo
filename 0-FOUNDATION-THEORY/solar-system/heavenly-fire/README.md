# Heavenly Fire (Solar Radiation)

What if, due to Earth's magnetic field weakening, we see intense solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, causing intense heat and damaging living things? Firestorms are the second most mentioned occurence in Allan Delair's cataclysm compilation (`EVIDENCE/cataclysm-chronology/cataclysm-allan-delair`). Additionally, there are many instances of old cities having been destroyed by high temperatures, in the Middle East and Scotland (`EVIDENCE/civilization-remnants/destroyed-cities`). Could this have been caused by solar radiation during an ECDO?

## Relation to human lifespan

A study of 63 million death records spanning 34 years revealed a clear relationship between average lifespan and sunspot numbers (SSN) at the time of birth. People born in months with sunspot numbers below 90 live, on average, 8-10 years (around 11%-15%) longer than those born in months with an SSN above 90.

"There is a statistically significant inverse relationship between exposure to solar energy at birth and average human lifespan. Solar energy by some mechanism alters the epigenome at birth, but the effect of higher solar energy becomes apparent after the age of natural selection."

## Lahaina Fires (Recent)

Were the Lahaina fires DEW fired or geophysical ECDO related?

Who knows...there were lots of anomalies like melted metal next to unburned plastic, trees burning up from the inside but their leaves left intact etc.

On the other hand there was very strong dry wind suggesting normal fire

OK now this is interesting and maybe this has been well documented (?) but the 6th and 7th largest solar flares in 2023 happened 2 days apart on 2023/08/05 and 2023/08/07, were long  duration and happened when Hawaii was facing the sun. The fires started on 2023/08/08. (Hawaii time is UTC-10)

Does it make sense that it only affected a small area and other places on Maui and on the other islands were not affected?

I don't know. Maybe. Depends on pinch points on the grid and the quality of home wiring and electronics. May be poor people's houses were more likely to be affected than the new millionaire piles? The electricity company was blamed from the start. Or may be it was a laser fired from a satellite? I'm just pointing something out.
