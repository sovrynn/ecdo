# Gravitational Null

The gas giants only have a combined mass about 0.13% that of the Sun. However, could they play a major role in creating gravitational nulls on the Earth?

## Nobulart [1]

"The net effect of the Sun's gravity is effectively neutralized by orbital centrifugal force."

"Since the Sun is straddling the barycentre, its gravitational field is only a small portion of the gravitational anomaly observed from the gas giants. They may be only 0.13% of the mass, but their movement is enough to modulate the energetic output of the 99.87% (and displace it by a full solar diameter)."

"The sun’s energetic output is electromagnetically coupled to the earth’s electromagnetic field. Perturbation of the sun’s field would be reflected in that of the earth. Birkeland. Alfven. So we could say that the earth’s electromagnetic field is being indirectly influenced by the gravitational effect of the planets upon the sun."

"The polar wander suggests that earth’s electromagnetic field is also directly influenced by the gravitational anomaly of the other planets."

## Gravitational Null - Thomas Chan (speculative) quote

*"However, at the time of a cataclysm the entire Solar System passes through a magnetic null zone in the Milky Way Galaxy. These null zones are sometimes popularly called “reversal zones”, and so they are, for the magnetic fields on either side of galactic null zones arc in opposite directions. Some physicists have found that we are heading into another null zone at an accelerating rate; it is a known fact of geophysics that the Earth’s magnetic field strength, now over 35% less than 300 years ago, is decreasing faster and faster; we are indeed approaching a null zone. In any case, when going through a null zone, our planet’s inner MHD energy structure is diminished to the extent that the outer, shallow molten layer, 60 miles thick, is allowed to act as a free liquid. No longer does it bind the shell of the Earth to its interior which starts 120 miles deep, as the mirror was bound through the mercury to the agitator by MHD energy in Hannes Alfven’s experiment."*
