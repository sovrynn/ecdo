# Solar Radiation

What if, due to Earth's magnetic field weakening, we see intense solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, causing intense heat and damaging living things? Firestorms are the second most mentioned occurence in Allan Delair's cataclysm compilation (`EVIDENCE/cataclysm-chronology/cataclysm-allan-delair`). Additionally, there are many instances of old cities having been destroyed by high temperatures, in the Middle East and Scotland (`EVIDENCE/civilization-history/destroyed-cities`). Could this have been caused by solar radiation during an ECDO?

## Relation to human lifespan

A study of 63 million death records spanning 34 years revealed a clear relationship between average lifespan and sunspot numbers (SSN) at the time of birth. People born in months with sunspot numbers below 90 live, on average, 8-10 years (around 11%-15%) longer than those born in months with an SSN above 90.

"There is a statistically significant inverse relationship between exposure to solar energy at birth and average human lifespan. Solar energy by some mechanism alters the epigenome at birth, but the effect of higher solar energy becomes apparent after the age of natural selection."
