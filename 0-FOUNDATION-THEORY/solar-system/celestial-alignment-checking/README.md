# Celestial Alignment Checking

This document is for detailing how to go about checking alignment of structures (ex Stonehenge) with celestial bodies.

Celestial bodies:
- celestial north pole
- solstices, equinoxes
- stars

## Celestial North Pole [1]

The Celestial North Pole is the point in the sky that the Earth's axis points toward, extending into space from the Earth's North Pole. Imagine the Earthâ€™s axis as an imaginary line that extends outward into the celestial sphere (the hypothetical sphere of stars surrounding the Earth). Where this line meets the celestial sphere in the Northern Hemisphere is called the Celestial North Pole.

As the Earth rotates, the stars and other celestial objects appear to move in circles around the celestial poles. The Celestial North Pole is the point in the sky around which all stars seem to rotate, especially visible in time-lapse photographs of the night sky.

Polaris (the North Star): Currently, the star Polaris is located very close to the Celestial North Pole, which is why it has been used for navigation. However, due to precession (the slow, conical wobble of Earth's axis over approximately 26,000 years), the Celestial North Pole does not always point toward Polaris. Thousands of years ago, it pointed toward a different star, and it will do so again in the future.

## Sun trajectory

This depends on the time of year (solstice/equinox) and also the exact latitude of the point.

You have to imagine a flat plane on the surface of Earth at the specific point.
