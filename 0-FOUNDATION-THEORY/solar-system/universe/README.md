# Universe (Outside the solar system)

## Milky Way

*"The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth..."* [5]

## Alpha Centauri, Proxima Centauri

*"Alpha Centauri (α Centauri, α Cen, or Alpha Cen) is a triple star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (α Centauri A), Toliman (α Centauri B), and Proxima Centauri (α Centauri C).[14] Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc)."* [6]

*"Alpha Centauri is getting closer to Earth. It’s approaching the Earth at about 20 km/s and will be closest in the year 29,700 AD... At this time, it will be about 3.26 light-years away. Then, it will start moving further away."* [7]

## Local Group

*"The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way, where Earth is located."* [4]

## Local Void

*"The Local Void is a vast, empty region of space, lying adjacent to the Local Group."* [3]

## KBC Void

*"The KBC Void (or Local Hole) is an immense, comparatively empty region of space, named after astronomers Ryan Keenan, Amy Barger, and Lennox Cowie, who studied it in 2013.[1]"*

*" As with other voids, it is not completely empty; it contains the Milky Way, the Local Group, and the larger part of the Laniakea Supercluster. The Milky Way is within a few hundred million light-years of the void's center."* [1]
