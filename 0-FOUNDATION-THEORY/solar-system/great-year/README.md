# Great Year

## The Great Year

The term Great Year has more than one major meaning. It is defined by scientific astronomy as "The period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, or about 25,800 years". [1]

## Great Year, Barnard's Star (hard copy here), Binary Year?

Is this the cause of the Great Year, and if so then every 12,000y we come closer to our binary star. Does this relate to the flippenings.

They have a lot of interesting content on their website: https://binaryresearchinstitute.org/bri/

They reference this ted talk, which is a good one: https://binaryresearchinstitute.org/bri/articles/there-is-something-out-there-by-mike-brown/

Or related to Nibiru perhaps?

"Seven great continental cataclysms occur during the occupation of the earth by the human life-wave for one round period." [1] "Nature has furnished her students with the means of reaching her mysteries, in the dual form of intuition and intellect, and of measuring her mighty forces in the forms of time and space. The first index of time is the rotation of the Earth upon her axis, the second by her annual motion about the Sun. These are broadly converted into days, months and years. The third index is that of the motion of the Earth’s center (the Sun) through space, around a still greater center; this is broadly divided into two measures, viz.; first, through one sign of the Zodiac, a period of 2,160 years, and secondly, through the entire twelve signs, which complete his grand revolution, or great Solar Year, in 25,920 years [one round] of Earthly time. The third and last face of the triune index is our Earth’s Pole. This magnetic point is the great finger of Nature’s Cyclic Timepiece, which governs and registers all the great Cosmic cycles of our planet and its circuit." [2]

One round is one precession cycle of 25,920 years. One seventh of this is 3702.8 years; the V planetary harmonic.

Probably not coincidence. "The third and last face of the triune index is our Earth’s Pole. This magnetic point is the great finger of Nature’s Cyclic Timepiece, which governs and registers all the great Cosmic cycles of our planet and its circuit."

## Great year

“There is also a year which Aristotle calls Perfect, rather than Great, which is formed by the revolution of the sun, of the moon and of the five planets, when they all come at the same time to the celestial point from which they started together. This year has a great winter called by the Greeks the Inundation and by the Latins The Deluge; it has also a summer which the Greeks call the Conflagration of the world. The world is supposed to have been by turns deluged or on fire at each of these epochs.” – Censorinus (238 A.D)

Hmmm, this quote "when they all come at the same time to the celestial point from which they started together"

Reminds me of the anno mundi and "thema mundi" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thema_Mundi

Attached has a lot of material to digest, but there are some quotes from Berossos, Cicero, Seneca, Heraclitus Stoicus, Macrobius, and Nemesius.
