# Earth Surface Material [1]

Rocks are naturally occurring solid aggregates of one or more minerals, mineraloids, or organic materials. They are classified into three main types based on their formation:
- **Igneous Rocks**: Formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava.
	- Intrusive (Plutonic): Formed inside the Earth, e.g., granite, diorite.
	- Extrusive (Volcanic): Formed on the Earth's surface, e.g., basalt, pumice.
- **Sedimentary Rocks**: Formed from the accumulation and lithification of sediments.
	- Clastic: Formed from fragments of other rocks, e.g., sandstone, shale.
	- Chemical: Formed from the evaporation of water and precipitation of minerals, e.g., limestone, rock salt.
	- Organic: Formed from the accumulation of organic material, e.g., coal, peat.
- **Metamorphic Rocks**: Formed from the alteration of existing rocks through heat, pressure, and/or chemically active fluids.
	- Foliated: Characterized by layered or banded appearance, e.g., schist, slate.
	- Non-foliated: Lacking a layered structure, e.g., marble, quartzite.

Bedrock is the continuous, solid rock layer that lies beneath the loose material (soil, sediment, etc.) on the Earth's surface. It can be composed of any type of rock: igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.

## Kola Borehole

Yes, the notion does seem quite preposterous doesn't it.  But, there are a lot of things we just don't know about the interior of our planet.  Case in point, here is an interesting excerpt from a book I've been reading through (very slowly)...

"The Kola deep borehole was the result of a scientific drilling project of the former USSR, that started in May of 1970 under the code name of SG-3. After 5 years, when the depth of the SG-3 well exceeded 7 kilometres, the new Uralmash drilling rig was mounted one of the most modern and technologically advanced for those times. Powerful, reliable, with an automatic tripping mechanism, it could withstand a string of pipes up to 15 km. The drill site is located on the Kola Peninsula, in the Pechengsky District of Murmansk Oblast in the far northwest Russia and bordered by the Barents Sea. Core samples of the Kola Superdeep Borehole can be seen at the repository in Zapolyarny, a town about 10 kilometres from the borehole's location. The project attempted to drill as deep as possible into the Earth's crust. The reason geologists chose Kola as the location for superdeep drilling is that the Fennoscandian Shield consists of very old rock, in some places the Precambrian crystalline igneous rock is exposed on the surface. Drilling deeper reaches even older rock and enables us to see even further back into the history of the Earth. The Kola borehole encountered 2.7 billion-year-old rocks at 12 kilometres’ depth. [...]

It used to be natural to think, that with distance from the surface of the Earth, with increasing pressure, rocks become more monolithic (compact), with a small number of cracks and pores. SG-3 convinced scientists to the contrary . Starting from 9 kilometres to the end of the borehole, the strata turned out to be very porous and literally crammed with cracks through which aqueous solutions circulated, this indicates that with depth at some point, pressure in the Earth’s interior decreases , proving the hydrostatic assumption of pressure (and density) is flawed. This means that below 9 km depth, the conventional calculated velocities of the seismic waves S and P and their paths inside Earth are also flawed. Researchers also reported the extraction of mud, which was “boiling with hydrogen” The Earth’s crust has gas. Unexpectedly, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and even carbon dioxide (from microbes) were found all along the borehole.

Without a doubt, the biggest surprise was the discovery of life: microscopic plankton fossils in rocks over two billion years old, found four miles beneath the surface, contradicting the scientific ideas of the day. These “microfossils” represented about 24 ancient species and were encased in organic compounds which somehow survived the extreme pressures and temperatures so far beneath the Earth’s surface. This raised numerous questions about the potential survival of life forms at impressive depths. Now, research has shown that life can exist even in oceanic crust, and even macroscopic life was found at over 1 km deep, but at the time, finding those fossils came as a shocker. With the Kola Deep Borehole findings, the lesson to be learned is simple: experience always beats theory. It has always been and always will be. In Russia, scientists are well aware that without wells, geophysicists' sections of the Earth's crust are just that, models and not facts. In order for specific rock formations to appear on these schemes, drilling data is needed.

"In 1984, the World Geological Congress was held in Moscow. Participants in the congress were waiting for an exhibition of the achievements of Russian geology, one of the stands was dedicated to the well SG-3. Experts around the world looked puzzled at the usual drilling head with erased carbide teeth. A large delegation of geologists and journalists went to the village of Zapolyarny in the Kola peninsula. Visitors were shown the drill in action, took out and disconnected the 33-meter sections of pipes. Piles of exactly the same drilling heads, like the one on the stand in Moscow, were rising around. The delegation of by then the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, was hosted by a well-known geologist, academician Dr. Vladimir Belousov. During a press conference from the audience, he was asked a question:

- What did the Kola well reveal the most important thing?

- Gentlemen! Most importantly, it showed that we know almost nothing about the continental crust, the scientist honestly answered.

One wonders how many scientists in the West, would assume today the same position as Dr Belousov in regards of the knowledge of the continental crust. Let alone what lies beneath it and further down. Little is known in the West, about the Kola Deep Borehole geological findings and it is unlikely that Western scientific textbooks will be updated someday. There are only so far, two books published in English (Springer-Verlag) dealing with this interesting subject, translated from Russian.""
