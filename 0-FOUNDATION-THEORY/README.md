# Foundation and Theory for ECDO

Prerequisite knowledge, speculative scientific theories, and in-depth explanation of Ethical Skeptic's ECDO hypothesis.

A reader should be able to come away from this folder with an understanding of precisely why and how the ECDO happens and various first/second/third order effects.

## Contents

**Major ECDO content**:
- `s1-to-s2`: S1 -> S2 rotation.
- `why-104-31-meridian`: Why the rotation is 104 degrees along the 31 Meridian.
- `oceanic-displacement`: Displacement of oceans and bodies of water.

**Minor ECDO content**:
- `s2`: All about S2.
- `s2-to-s1`: S2 -> S1 rotation.

**Prerequisite knowledge**:
- `dzhanibekov`: Dzhanibekov effect.
- `core-mantle`: Core-mantle coupling.
- `solar-system`: Solar system.
- `earth-inner-layers`: Inner layers of the Earth.
- `earth-material`: Material that makes up the surface of the Earth.
- `tectonic-plates`: Tectonic plate interactions.
- `volcanoes`: Volcano activity surges.
- `equatorial-bulge`: Equatorial bulge.

# TODO

Prior knowledge to understand:
- core-mantle magnetic coupling
- Dzhanibekov effect

ECDO phenomena to flesh out:
- All differences between S1 and S2
    - Temperature changes (very cold during S2?)
- time spent in S2
- transition from S2 back to S1 (slow or fast?)
- Verification of Ethical Skeptic's thesis (hard to know without knowing if there's any information he's not sharing)
- why 104 degrees?

- Fluid dynamics simulations
	- calculate the function of dzhanibekov rotation speed
	- 2d sim: take the elevation path and apply the same land acceleration speed derived from dzhanibekov rotation
	- 3d sim: use topography maps and ocean volume to determine the water surge at specific coastal areas
