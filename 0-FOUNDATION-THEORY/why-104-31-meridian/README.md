# Rotation Amount - Why 104 degrees on the 31 Meridian?

This folder is dedicated to understanding why the Earth rotates 104 degrees on the 31 Meridian.

## Khafre Pyramid

The Khafre Pyramid is hypothesized to lie directly on the longitude line rotating to the pole, because this is the only way that the shafts in the pyramid would align with the poles in S1 and S2. This implies that it was intentionally built in that precise location.

This diagram displays the lower shafts, which are hypothesized to be for measuring magnetic moment.

If you rotate this pyramid in any direction other than the one Ethical Skeptic hypothesizes, the observation shafts will not work - this is a foundational aspect of the hypothesis.

# TODO

Ethical Skeptic's third thesis has a very in-depth explanation on why the design of the Khafre pyramid would support the exact rotation amount and orientation he describes.

Other leads:
- inverted starmaps found side by side with regular maps in at least two structures in Egypt
- Distribution of mass as determined by our current gravitational data
- Centroid of South Africa LLVP precise calculations
