# 3700 year cycle

1700 BC (~3700 years ago) appears to be a very historically significant time:
- Many records of a "natural disaster" event - from India (Manu), China (Gun-Yu), Crete (Minoan), Turkey, Pakistan (Mohenjo-Daro), Tiahuanaco, Easter Island (`cataclysm-chronology`)
- Late Bronze Age Collapse
	- Evidence of destruction of many cities in the Middle East around this time (`civilization-remnants/human-built-structures`)
		- Canaanite palace swallowed by a fissure 3700 years ago (`civilization-remnants`)
		- Tall el-Hammam city melted by extreme temperature ~3700 years ago (`civilization-remnants/human-built-structures`)
	- Records of immigration in the Mediterranean area coinciding with the Greek Dark Ages (`civilization-remnants`)
- Mammoths mutating 3700 years ago (`biology/animal-plant-remains`)

If we go back 3700 more years to 5400 BC, there is evidence as well:
- Noahic deluge potentially in 5200 BC, Book of Genesis (`bible`)
- Chichancanab lake filled with saltwater about 7800 years ago in 5800 BC (`biology/animal-plant-remains`)
- Sinking of city Dwarka in 5525 BCE

Going back another 3700 years to 9100 BC:
- End of the Younger Dryas
- Plato's account of a story about Atlantis sinking in approximately 9600 BC (`cataclysm-chronology`)

Finally you also have a harmonic of the gas giant grand cycle which aligns with these dates (`solar-system`).
