# Frequency of ECDO event

Goal: Predict how frequent the ECDO event is.

## Contents

- `date-anomalies`: Dating anomalies and calendar changes.

# Overview

The two popular hypotheses are:
1. ~6000 years
2. ~3700 years

Alternate hypothesis:
- every 1800 years
- non-linear timeline

I tend towards a quasi-periodic timeline, based on a timeline of Holocene events compiled in `evidence/MEGA-TIMELINE`.

## Alternate hypothesis: 10th harmonic (twice as frequent as 3700 years) [1]

Is this perhaps a comet locked in the tenth harmonic (The harmonics are all expressed relative to the 18.5ka I)?

See `EVIDENCE/solar-system/encke-comet` for a full analysis.

## Grep searching notable dates

To see what info is in the repo on notable dates, run a grep search: `grep -nr 3700 --include="*.md" .`

Sometimes the dates are just slightly off (ex: 3650). You'd have to be more thorough with grep to find those.

# TODO

There's some data from Earth core/soil data showing evidence of past geomagnetic excursions. That would be good to investigate and put in here.

Bond cycle, which indicates massive ice-melt events every 1000-1500 years, many of them coincident with known megaflood accounts.

Ben (Suspicious Observers) also endorses the 6000 year cycle view. See `LITERATURE-MEDIA/ben-davidson` for more.
