"Thus Christ, born at the dawn of the Piscean age, was Ikthus the Fish, the letters of which name form the initials of the Greek phrase Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour. The vesica piscis, the geometrical sign of the fish, was adopted as the basic figure of Christian architecture and iconography, an obvious example being the mandorla that surrounds Christ in Glory. "

There is actually better reasons Bible's text to associate Pisces with the current age, inaugurated about 1996 or 1997 years ago, but that will suffice.

This is rooted in the idea of "chiliasm" or "millennialism".  

“The school of Eliyahu (Elijah) taught: Six thousand years is the duration of the world. Two thousand of the six thousand years are characterized by chaos [Taurus - Bull of Heaven]; two thousand years are characterized by Torah [Aries - The Sacrificial Ram], from the era of the Patriarchs until the end of the mishnaic period; and two thousand years are the period of the coming of the Messiah [Pisces - Age of Messiah (meaning anointed one)].”

Elijah was in the 9th century BCE, predating Plato.

In the Bible "7" is a big deal. Huge deal actually.  It starts in the 1st chapter in Genesis and ripples through the entire text.  There is so much more to it, but here is an introduction to it:

EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITINGS
 
Epistle of Barnabas 17:7-9 (First Century AD) 
“Therefore, children, in six days, or in six thousand years, all the prophecies will be fulfilled. Then it says, ‘He rested on the seventh day.’ This signifies at the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus, He will destroy the Antichrist, judge the ungodly, and change the sun, moon, and stars. Then He will truly rest during the Millennial reign, which is the seventh day.”
 
Iranaeus Against Heresies 5:28 (180 AD)
“The day of the Lord is as a thousand years; and in six days created things were completed. It is evident, therefore, they will come to an end in the six thousandth year.”
 
Hippolytus, Fragment 2′ Commentary on Daniel 2:4 (205 A.D.)
“The Sabbath is a type of the future kingdom… For “a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.” Since, then, in six days the Lord created all things, it follows that in six thousand years all will be fulfilled.”
 
Commodianus; Against the Gods of the Heathens 80 (240 A.D.)
“Resurrection of the body will be when six thousand years are completed, and after the one thousand years (millennial reign), the world will come to an end.”
 
Lactantius; Divine Institutes 7:14 (304 A.D.)
“The sixth thousandth year is not yet complete. When this number is complete, the consummation must take place.”

The church of Rome and Byzantium crushed this teaching post Constantine as a heresy and it has largely been ignored for over a thousand years.

Wikipedia does a fair job describing the phenomenon

3. Now Adam, who was the first man, and made out of the earth: (for our discourse must now be about him:) after Abel was slain, and Cain fled away, on account of his murder, was sollicitous for posterity; and had a vehement desire of children: he being two hundred and thirty years old: after which time he lived other seven hundred, and then died. He had indeed many other children: (11) but Seth in particular [An. 4355]. As for the rest it would be tedious to name them: I will therefore only endeavour to give an account of those that proceeded from Seth. Now this Seth, when he was brought up, and came to those years in which he could discern what was good, became a virtuous man: and as he was himself of an excellent character, so did he leave children behind him who imitated his virtues. (12) All these proved to be of good dispositions. They also inhabited the same country without dissensions, and in an happy condition, without any misfortunes falling upon them, till they died. [About An. 4300] They also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom, which is concerned with the heavenly bodies, and their order. And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, upon Adam’s prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the force of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of water, they made two pillars: (13) the one of brick, the other of stone: they inscribed their discoveries on them both: that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain, and exhibit those discoveries to mankind: and also inform them that there was another pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains in the land of Siriad to this day.

In the twenty-ninth jubilee, in the first week, [1373 A.M.] in the beginning thereof Arpachshad took to himself a wife and her name was Rasu'eja, the daughter of Susan, the daughter of Elam, and she bare him a son in the third year in this week, [1375 A.M.] and he called his name Kainam.
And the son grew, and his father taught him writing, and he went to seek for himself a place where he might seize for himself a city.
And he found a writing which former (generations) had carved on the rock, and he read what was thereon, and he transcribed it and sinned owing to it; for it contained the teaching of the Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens of the sun and moon and stars in all the signs of heaven.
And he wrote it down and said nothing regarding it; for he was afraid to speak to Noah about it lest he should be angry with him on account of it.

My current crazy theory is that Adam knew and was told the end from the very beginning.  He acted as the king/priest of the earth.  The role passed to Seth and eventually to Enoch, then to Noah, then to Shem.  Shem skipped over his son Arphaxad and gave the blessing/birthright to Abraham.  This primordial knowledge passed down in fragments and myths that we see shadows of even to this very day.

That forbidden location of monumental writing may have been a place like Göbekli Tepe or perhaps writing that remained visible on the white surface stones of the pyramid at Giza?
