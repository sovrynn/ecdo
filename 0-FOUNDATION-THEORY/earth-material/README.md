# Earth Material [1]

Rocks are naturally occurring solid aggregates of one or more minerals, mineraloids, or organic materials. They are classified into three main types based on their formation:
- **Igneous Rocks**: Formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava.
	- Intrusive (Plutonic): Formed inside the Earth, e.g., granite, diorite.
	- Extrusive (Volcanic): Formed on the Earth's surface, e.g., basalt, pumice.
- **Sedimentary Rocks**: Formed from the accumulation and lithification of sediments.
	- Clastic: Formed from fragments of other rocks, e.g., sandstone, shale.
	- Chemical: Formed from the evaporation of water and precipitation of minerals, e.g., limestone, rock salt.
	- Organic: Formed from the accumulation of organic material, e.g., coal, peat.
- **Metamorphic Rocks**: Formed from the alteration of existing rocks through heat, pressure, and/or chemically active fluids.
	- Foliated: Characterized by layered or banded appearance, e.g., schist, slate.
	- Non-foliated: Lacking a layered structure, e.g., marble, quartzite.

Bedrock is the continuous, solid rock layer that lies beneath the loose material (soil, sediment, etc.) on the Earth's surface. It can be composed of any type of rock: igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.
