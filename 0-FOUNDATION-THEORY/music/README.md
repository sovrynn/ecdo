# Music

Octaves are based on frequencies, one octave spans a 2x in frequency.

Frequencies run on a logarithmic scale, meaning that each step up is a multiple, not an addition.

An octave is divided into 12 semitones. In the C major scale for example, F is a semitone from E, and C is a semitone from B.

## Major/Minor Scales

Major scales follow step patterns of W-W-H-W-W-W-H, where W is a whole step (2 semitones) and H a half step (1 semitone).

Minor scales, in contrast, follow W-H-W-W-H-W-W.
