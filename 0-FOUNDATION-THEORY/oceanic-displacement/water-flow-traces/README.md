# Water Flow Traces

What kind of traces does water flow leave?

## Overview

- ripples
- erosion
- erratic stones
- sediment deposits
- drainage patterns

### Ripples

Giant current ripples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_current_ripples

*"Aeolian dunes tend to form extremely long parallel formations in large deserts. This occurs with water flows, but only typically where they are restricted through bottlenecks and the flow accelerates - these form parallel to the flow, not transverse. The transverse current ripples we're more used to seeing always exhibit some degree of disturbance in the pattern. Never long parallel bands."* [3]

## Erosion

Water flow leaves erosion. See `EVIDENCE/physical-material/erosion`.

## Erratic Stones

Large stones in strange places. See `EVIDENCE/physical-material/large-rocks`.

What may be of greatest importance is rocks that seem to have come from other locations.

## Sediment Deposits

Alluval fans (fan-shaped sediment deposits).

## Drainage Patterns

See `hard-copies/Drainage-Patterns.pdf`. [2]

## Streamlined bedrock

These are from a Canadian paper examining glacial meltwater flood erosion. Looks similar.

## That paper infers that erosion... [3]

That paper infers that erosion of the landscape may very well have been prevented by the deciduous trees which grew there for a considerable period of its geological history. There may well have been nothing for us to find today were it not for those ancient forests.
