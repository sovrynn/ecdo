# Geomagnetic Storms

"A geomagnetic storm, also known as a magnetic storm, is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave.

The disturbance that drives the magnetic storm may be a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) or (much less severely) a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), a high-speed stream of solar wind originating from a coronal hole.[1] The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the sunspot cycle. During solar maxima, geomagnetic storms occur more often, with the majority driven by CMEs." [1]

## 1859 Carrington Event [2]

"The Carrington Event was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, peaking on 1–2 September 1859 during solar cycle 10. It created strong auroral displays that were reported globally and caused sparking and even fires in telegraph stations.[1] The geomagnetic storm was most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun colliding with Earth's magnetosphere."

Because of the geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field, telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving their operators electric shocks.[22] Telegraph pylons threw sparks.[23] Some operators were able to continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies.[24][25] The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American telegraph line between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Evening Traveler:

```
    Boston operator (to Portland operator): "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."

    Portland operator: "Will do so. It is now disconnected."

    Boston: "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"

    Portland: "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."

    Boston: "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."

    Portland: "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"

    Boston: "Yes. Go ahead."
```

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.
