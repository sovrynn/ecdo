# North Pole Measurement

Who measures the north pole and how?

## History of North Pole Measurement [1]

Over the centuries, various organizations and institutions have been involved in measuring and publishing data about the North Poleâ€”particularly the **Magnetic North Pole** and the **Geomagnetic North Pole**. These measurements have shifted from being made by individual explorers and scientists to more formalized and institutional efforts as technology and global cooperation have improved.

### Key Organizations Currently Involved:

1. **British Geological Survey (BGS)**:
   - The BGS plays a significant role in monitoring Earth's magnetic field and updating the position of the Magnetic North Pole. It collaborates with other international organizations to maintain and improve the **World Magnetic Model (WMM)**.
   
2. **National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**:
   - Based in the United States, the NCEI, part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), is one of the primary organizations responsible for producing the World Magnetic Model, used for navigation and tracking the movement of the Magnetic North Pole.
   
3. **European Space Agency (ESA)**:
   - ESA operates the **Swarm** mission, a set of satellites specifically designed to monitor Earth's magnetic field from space. This contributes critical data to track the location and movement of the Magnetic North Pole.
   
4. **Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN)**:
   - NRCAN monitors magnetic data, particularly because the Magnetic North Pole has historically been located in Canada (although it is moving towards Siberia). They also publish information about the pole's location and movement.
   
5. **International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA)**:
   - This international scientific organization oversees the standardization of geomagnetic measurements and data sharing. IAGA plays a central role in organizing scientific collaborations around the world to study Earth's magnetic field.

6. **International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)**:
   - The IHO is involved in updating marine navigation charts, which rely on accurate magnetic data, and cooperates with organizations like NOAA and BGS to use the latest measurements of the magnetic poles.

### Historical Context and Changes in Organizations:

In the **19th and early 20th centuries**, individual explorers and scientists such as **James Clark Ross** (who discovered the Magnetic North Pole in 1831) were responsible for early measurements. National governments, especially those with Arctic interests, also sponsored scientific expeditions. Some key developments in history:

- **19th Century**: 
   - Early measurements were primarily done by explorers, naval expeditions, and scientific societies like the **Royal Geographical Society** and the **Royal Navy**.
   - During this period, research on the poles was scattered and often linked to geographic discovery rather than continuous scientific observation.
   
- **20th Century**: 
   - The establishment of more formalized government institutions such as the **U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey** (now part of NOAA) and Canada's **Dominion Observatory** marked a shift toward regular monitoring.
   - The advent of global cooperation during and after World War II led to more comprehensive efforts by international bodies like the IAGA and IHO.
   
- **Late 20th Century to Present**: 
   - With advances in satellite technology and global collaboration, agencies like the **British Geological Survey**, **NOAA**, and **ESA** have taken the lead in producing reliable data on the poles, particularly through the World Magnetic Model.
   - Modern efforts now involve not just local or national observations but global networks of ground stations, aircraft surveys, and satellites.

In summary, while individual explorers and national expeditions played key roles in the early centuries, today, the responsibility for measuring and tracking the poles has shifted to a small group of international organizations and government agencies. The tools and scope of these measurements have expanded dramatically thanks to technological advances like satellite monitoring.
