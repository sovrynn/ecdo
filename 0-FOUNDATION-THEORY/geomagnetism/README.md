## Geomagnetic Field [1,3]

*"Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from Earth's interior out into space, where it interacts with the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of a mixture of molten iron and nickel in Earth's outer core: these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo... A dynamo is thought to be the source of the Earth's magnetic field and the magnetic fields of Mercury and the Jovian planets."*

## Dynamo

*"A dynamo is an electrical generator that creates direct current using a commutator."* [4]

## Magnetosphere [2]

*"In astronomy and planetary science, a magnetosphere is a region of space surrounding an astronomical object in which charged particles are affected by that object's magnetic field.[1][2] It is created by a celestial body with an active interior dynamo."*

*"In the space environment close to a planetary body with a dipole magnetic field such as Earth, the field lines resemble a simple magnetic dipole. Farther out, field lines can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducting plasma, as emitted from the Sun (i.e., the solar wind) or a nearby star."*

- how can a current be generated through magnetic field
- dynamo = commutator
- Schumann resonances
