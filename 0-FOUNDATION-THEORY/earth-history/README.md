## Younger Dryas - Undeniable ECDO event? [1]

"The Younger Dryas (YD) was a period in Earth's geologic history that occurred circa 12,900 to 11,700 years Before Present (BP).[2] It is primarily known for the sudden or "abrupt" cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, when the North Atlantic Ocean cooled and annual air temperatures decreased by ~3 °C (5.4 °F) over North America, 2–6 °C (3.6–10.8 °F) in Europe and up to 10 °C (18 °F) in Greenland, in a few decades.[3] Cooling in Greenland was particularly rapid, taking place over just 3 years or less.[1][4] At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere experienced warming.[3][5] This period ended as rapidly as it began, with dramatic warming over ~50 years, which transitioned the Earth from the glacial Pleistocene epoch into the current Holocene."

"During the preceding period, the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial, rapid warming in the Northern Hemisphere[9]: 677  was offset by the equivalent cooling in the Southern Hemisphere.[10][8] This "polar seesaw" pattern is consistent with changes in thermohaline circulation (particularly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation or AMOC), which greatly affects how much heat is able to go from the Southern Hemisphere to the North. The Southern Hemisphere cools and the Northern Hemisphere warms when the AMOC is strong, and the opposite happens when it is weak.[10] The scientific consensus is that severe AMOC weakening explains the climatic effects of the Younger Dryas.[11]: 1148  It also explains why the Holocene warming had proceeded so rapidly once the AMOC change was no longer counteracting the increase in carbon dioxide levels."

## Dansgaard-Oeschger event (pre-Holocene) [7]

"Dansgaard–Oeschger events (often abbreviated D–O events), named after palaeoclimatologists Willi Dansgaard and Hans Oeschger, are rapid climate fluctuations that occurred 25 times during the last glacial period. Some scientists say that the events occur quasi-periodically with a recurrence time being a multiple of 1,470 years, but this is debated. The comparable climate cyclicity during the Holocene is referred to as Bond events."

"In the Northern Hemisphere, they take the form of rapid warming episodes, typically in a matter of decades, each followed by gradual cooling over a longer period. For example, about 11,500 years ago, averaged annual temperatures on the Greenland ice sheet increased by around 8 °C over 40 years, in three steps of five years,[3] where a 5 °C change over 30–40 years is more common.[4] Warming resulting from D-O events extended farther south into central North America as well, as indicated by speleothem oxygen isotope excursions chronologically corresponding to D-O events recorded in Greenland ice cores."

"The course of a D-O event sees a rapid warming, followed by a cool period lasting a few hundred years.[8] This cold period sees an expansion of the polar front, with ice floating further south across the North Atlantic Ocean."

"The events may be caused by an amplification of solar forcings, or by a cause internal to the earth system – either a "binge-purge" cycle of ice sheets accumulating so much mass they become unstable, as postulated for Heinrich events, or an oscillation in deep ocean currents (Maslin et al.. 2001, p25)."

If we are comparing these to what we predict are recent ECDO flips, it seems opposite - 2200 BC event for example is described as "arid and cool", led up to over centuries of exothermic core warming, whereas these are described as a rapid warming, and a gradual cooling...

It's possible this could be resulting from selection bias (data cherry-picking) and just depicting different phases of the same process.
