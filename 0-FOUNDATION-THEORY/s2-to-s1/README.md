# S2 to S1

This folder is for understanding the transition from S2 back to S1.

Specifically, this folder is for the parts of S2 -> S1 that are different from S1 -> S2. Generic aspects of the rotation which apply to both rotations are located in `s1-to-s2`.

## TES - Gradual [1]

My suspicion is that the reversion from State 2 back to State 1 is slower. With those displacements being more an artifact of the viscoelastic mantle of the Earth, rather than inertia per se.

Unfortunately things are going to get all messed up again when S2>S1 happens. The climate will be disrupted for quite a long time in human terms. Possibly hundreds of years before things start to normalize again.

The only way I can currently account for the evidence of the eastern US (including that of the inundation of the Appalachians) is that S2>S1 isn't a walk in the park.

Also the western coast of Southern Africa, and the erosion formations between india and Sri Lanka. I'm sure I'm forgetting many more than I'm remembering.
