# S2 to S1

This folder is for understanding the transition from S2 back to S1.

Specifically, this folder is for the parts of S2 -> S1 that are different from S1 -> S2. Generic aspects of the rotation which apply to both rotations are located in `s1-to-s2`.

# TODO

Nobulart prediction: Unfortunately things are going to get all messed up again when S2>S1 happens. The climate will be disrupted for quite a long time in human terms. Possibly hundreds of years before things start to normalize again.
