# S2 to S1

This folder is for understanding the transition from S2 back to S1.

Specifically, this folder is for the parts of S2 -> S1 that are different from S1 -> S2. Generic aspects of the rotation which apply to both rotations are located in `s1-to-s2`.

Unfortunately things are going to get all messed up again when S2>S1 happens. The climate will be disrupted for quite a long time in human terms. Possibly hundreds of years before things start to normalize again.

The only way I can currently account for the evidence of the eastern US (including that of the inundation of the Appalachians) is that S2>S1 isn't a walk in the park.

Also the western coast of Southern Africa, and the erosion formations between india and Sri Lanka. I'm sure I'm forgetting many more than I'm remembering.
