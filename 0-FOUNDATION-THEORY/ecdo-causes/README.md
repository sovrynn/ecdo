# Cause(s) of the ECDO

## TES - Exothermic and Endothermic Core Cycle [1]

TES's basic ECDO timeline is as follows:

1. *"Weakening of the core-mantle magnetic coupling (Earth’s geomagnetic moment) and North Pole (Np) priority."*
2. *"Contribution of exothermic kinetic energy (heat) into the Earth’s mantle (see Exhibit E2), excluding the axially-located Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVP – see Exhibit E) – which become relatively lower in density as compared to the surrounding core-fed mantle."*
3. *"Causing dramatic ocean SST and northern hemisphere tundra warming, along with a resulting forced carbon dioxide and methane release."*
4. *"Once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the core-mantle magnetic coupling gives way to a gyroscopically mediated form of Dzhanibekov rotation from Np to Np‘ (104º along 31º E longitude – the same meridian as the Khufu Pyramid). The H-layer of the core accelerates its exothermic sloughing, and this material-shedding effect serves as a kind of ‘infinite lubricant’ between the core and the mantle, allowing the two bodies to rotate independently."*

## Nobulart - Electromagnetic Solar/Planetary Perturbation

Nobulart proposes that electromagnetic perturbations inside the Earth are caused by solar and planetary interactions, which I imagine as a form of electromagnetic induction caused by traversing changing magnetic fields.

*"Core-mantle coupling is considered to be a product of electromagnetic, viscous and topographic effects. My working theory is that the EM component is cyclically perturbed by interplanetary and solar interactions which cascade as heating and a lowering of viscosities"*.
