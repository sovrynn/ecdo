# Cause(s) of the ECDO

## TES - Exothermic and Endothermic Core Cycle

TES's explanation for the cause of the ECDO bottoms out at an exothermic and endothermic core-mantle cycle. The exothermic phase eventually leads to the decoupling of the core and mantle, upon which the mantle performs a mediated Dzhanibekov oscillation of 104 degrees. The endothermic phase results in the (potentially gradual) transition back to S1:

## Nobulart - Electromagnetic Solar/Planetary Perturbation

Nobulart proposes electromagnetic perturbations caused by solar and planetary interactions, which I imagine as a form of electromagnetic induction caused by traversing changing magnetic fields.

*"Core-mantle coupling is considered to be a product of electromagnetic, viscous and topographic effects. My working theory is that the EM component is cyclically perturbed by interplanetary and solar interactions which cascade as heating and a lowering of viscosities"*.
