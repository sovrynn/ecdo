# Cause(s) of the ECDO

## TES - Exothermic and Endothermic Core Cycle [1]

TES's basic ECDO timeline is as follows:

1. *"Weakening of the core-mantle magnetic coupling (Earth’s geomagnetic moment) and North Pole (Np) priority."*
2. *"Contribution of exothermic kinetic energy (heat) into the Earth’s mantle (see Exhibit E2), excluding the axially-located Large Low-Velocity-Shear Provinces (LLVP – see Exhibit E) – which become relatively lower in density as compared to the surrounding core-fed mantle."*
3. *"Causing dramatic ocean SST and northern hemisphere tundra warming, along with a resulting forced carbon dioxide and methane release."*
4. *"Once past a specific threshold of reduced magnetic moment, the core-mantle magnetic coupling gives way to a gyroscopically mediated form of Dzhanibekov rotation from Np to Np‘ (104º along 31º E longitude – the same meridian as the Khufu Pyramid). The H-layer of the core accelerates its exothermic sloughing, and this material-shedding effect serves as a kind of ‘infinite lubricant’ between the core and the mantle, allowing the two bodies to rotate independently."*

## Nobulart - Electromagnetic Solar/Planetary Perturbation

Nobulart proposes that electromagnetic perturbations inside the Earth are caused by solar and planetary interactions, which I imagine as a form of electromagnetic induction caused by traversing changing magnetic fields.

*"Core-mantle coupling is considered to be a product of electromagnetic, viscous and topographic effects. My working theory is that the EM component is cyclically perturbed by interplanetary and solar interactions which cascade as heating and a lowering of viscosities"*.

## Speculative exothermic core instigator

The phase state change of hexagonal close packed iron in the core into the mantle may be driven by solar proton storms (From CMEs) into the core via the poles by slamming positively charged protons into a solid mass of Fe+ causing mantle heating and density changes. As we see the magnetic field deteriorate are we seeing this process accelerate exponentially taking us to the TAU point TES describes? Are they trying to slow this down by seeding the atmosphere with negatively ions?

A neutrino storm could significantly raise the number of interactions which occur internally. Each neutrino interaction is potentially a nuclear fission or fusion heating event.
