Several sources:
- rotational axis data (for short-timeframe knowledge)
- geomagnetic data (north pole, SAA tipping point)
- weather

# Rotational axis data

iers.org publishes the rotational axis data.

It only updates weekly, including the "daily" bulletin.

However the underlying data from US naval observatary seems to get uploaded daily here  https://maia.usno.navy.mil
