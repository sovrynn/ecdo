# Forecasting an Impending ECDO Rotation

Goal is to predict when the next ECDO will happen.
- Recent climate and geo-state anomalies are in `EVIDENCE/PRESENT-CLIMATE-ANOMALIES`.
- Impending cosmic/geomagnetic alignments are in `EVIDENCE/IMPENDING-ALIGNMENTS`.

## Evidence for an impending ECDO

Currently, the strongest piece of evidence we have for an impending ECDO event is the accelerating north pole wander and weakening magnetic field.

Past that, there are also exothermic core and temperature anomalies. These are causing climate change, such as increased rainfall.

Finally we have some more emergent evidence in `EVIDENCE/conspiracy-theories` concerning frenzied movements of "elites" in potential preparation for this.

## Best forecast date - next few decades (2030-2060)

There are a host of solar, planetary, and cosmic alignments in 2030. Additionally the geomagnetic field seems to be approaching a tipping point. See `date-and-triggers`.

## Signals that we are on the brink [1]

There will be quakes, eruptions and extreme weather due to the disruptions to the electromagnetic field. Weather like we have never seen I imagine. I think we will know when itâ€™s imminent.

Almost certainly a globally experienced seismic movement in the hours before, and then a short time as the new dominant axis exponentially gains centrifugal dominance.

The concept of a *W-shaped climate event*, as we have seen some potential past evidence of, makes me wonder if we aren't at least 5 years to a few decades out from the actual flip. The caveat being, of course, that the leadup will bring an *intense aridification* probably involving *extreme heat*.

# TODO

investigate additional data feeds related to the ECDO that can help with monitoring
- geomagnetic field
- temperature
- storms
- auroras
