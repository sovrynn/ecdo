# Forecasting an Impending ECDO Rotation

Goal is to predict when the next ECDO will happen.

## Contents

- `date-and-triggers`: Date and triggers for the next ECDO event.
- `recent-natural-disasters`: Recent natural disasters.
- (Speculative) `shudder`: A vague potential imminent phenomenon that Ethical Skeptic referred to on social media.

# Overview

Currently, the strongest piece of evidence we have for an impending ECDO event is the accelerating north pole wander. See `EVIDENCE/earth-geo-state/geomagnetic/north-pole-wander`.

Past that, there are also exothermic core and temperature anomalies.

# TODO

- investigate additional data feeds related to the ECDO such as temperature
