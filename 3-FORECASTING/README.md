Goal is to predict when the next ECDO will happen.

- `date-and-triggers`: Date and triggers for the next ECDO event.

- (Speculative) `shudder`: A vague potential imminent phenomenon that Ethical Skeptic referred to on social media.

## Evidence for an impending ECDO

Currently, the strongest piece of evidence we have for an impending ECDO event is the accelerating north pole wander. See `EVIDENCE/earth-geo-state/geomagnetic/north-pole-wander`.

Past that, there are also exothermic core and temperature anomalies.

## Signals that it is about to happen [1]

There will be quakes, eruptions and extreme weather due to the disruptions to the electromagnetic field. Weather like we have never seen I imagine. I think we will know when it’s imminent.

# TODO

- investigate additional data feeds related to the ECDO such as temperature
