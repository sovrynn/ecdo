## Planetary effects on the Sun's activity

Landscheidt (see `LITERATURE/landscheidt`) proposes that the planets affect the Sun's activity. Particularly, the position of the gas giants (Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Saturn), which are the planets with the most mass, determines the Sun's trajectory around the center of mass of the solar system.

Jupiter, being the heaviest one, with a mass roughly 2.51 times the combined mass of Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn, plays the biggest role.

Specifically, Landscheidt says that the most important moments are when the Sun, the CM (centre of mass) of the solar system, and Jupiter are in line. When JUNS (Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn) are on the same side of the Sun, the Sun will be furthest from the CM. When Jupiter is opposite UNS, the Sun will be closest to the CM.

When IOT (impulses of torque) are graphed over time, they are shown to form waves of approximately 166 years. At the top and bottom of these waves, where the IOT are strongest, occurring every ~83 years, there is a maximum in the sunspot cycle, which Landscheidt proposes is caused by slower rotation of the Sun.

Landscheidt predicts that there will be a supersecular sunspot minimum around 2030. However, looking at his description in the above visual, he clearly says there is a "maximum" every 83 years. The discrepancy may be explained if he is referring to an absolute value maximum in the visual.
