# Oceanic Displacement

This document is for understanding the oceanic displacement during the rotation.

## Basic Analogy

If you have a bowl of water, and push it to the side, the water will first slosh one way, but then it'll immediately slosh back the other way. This is because the body of water is small, so the momentum travels very quickly from one end of the water to the next.

Oceans are different. Oceans are massive - extremely deep, and extremely wide. When one end of the ocean starts getting pushed, the other end of the ocean is not going to react until a long time later.

There is going to be water. And the water is going to meet a continent rushing at it at speeds of potentially hundreds or thousands of kilometers an hour. See `FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/s1-to-s2/rotation-vector-field` for more.

The water will have to go somewhere, in that very moment, by pushing something else out of the way. Just try running your hand through the surface of a pool very fast. If the land really does move at hundreds or thousands of kilometers an hour, inevitably, some of the water will move onto the land, where it only has to move air out of the way to flow. A path of least resistance.

It will seem like the water is rushing into the land but it will really be the land that is rushing into the water.
