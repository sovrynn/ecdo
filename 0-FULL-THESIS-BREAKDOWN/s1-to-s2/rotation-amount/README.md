# Rotation Amount - Why 104?

This folder is dedicated to understanding not only why the Earth rotates 104 degrees, but also why the South Africa LLVP centroid will be rotating to the geographic north pole.

## Potential Justification

- Distribution of mass as determined by our current gravitational data
- Khafre Pyramid design
- inverted starmaps foud side by side with regular maps in at least two structures in Egypt
- Centroid of South Africa LLVP was precisely calculated to be a special value that is important in Dzhanibekov rotation
