# Overview

This folder is intended to be an in-depth breakdown and SCIENTIFIC analysis of Ethical Skeptic's ECDO hypothesis.

A reader should be able to come away from this folder with an understanding of precisely why and how the ECDO happens and various first/second/third order effects.

## Contents

Notable ECDO content:
- `s1-to-s2`: All matters concerning the transition from S1 to S2, and an ECDO rotation in general.
- `equatorial-bulge`: Investigating how the equatorial bulge will interact with the ECDO.

ECDO related:
- `s2`: All about S2.
- `s2-to-s1`: All about S2 to S1.
- `tectonic-plates`: How tectonic plates will interact with the ECDO.

Prerequisite knowledge:
- `core-mantle`: Information on core-mantle coupling.
- `dzhanibekov`: Information on Dzhanibekov effect.
- `solar-system`: Facets of the solar system which may affect the ECDO.

## Information that doesn't belong here

Do NOT put historical or physical evidence of the ECDO in here. You can still reference it in your analysis; just put it in `ADHOC-EVIDENCE` and add a link to it.

Anecdotal evidence about the impending rotation, and predictions about it, belong not here, but in `MONITORING-PRESENT-ROTATION`. Backlink it if you wish to refer to it in `ecdo-frequency` analysis.

## TODO

Prior knowledge to understand:
- core-mantle magnetic coupling
- Dzhanibekov effect starting with the finding of the principal axes of inertia of an object in rotation including the Earth
    - math definition: eigenvectors of the inertia tensor
    - inertia tensor?

ECDO phenomena to flesh out:
- All differences between S1 and S2
    - Temperature changes (very cold during S2?)
- time spent in S2
- transition from S2 back to S1 (slow or fast?)
- Verification of Ethical Skeptic's thesis (hard to know without knowing if there's any information he's not sharing)
- why 104 degrees?

- Global maps showing:
    - the circular paths of oceanic displacement around the two pivots
