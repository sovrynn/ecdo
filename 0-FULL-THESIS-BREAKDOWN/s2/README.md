# S2

This folder is for understanding S2, which is the state of the Earth after the first ECDO rotation.

## Duration of S2

Duration could be anywhere from 2-50 years.

## New Geographic Pole Locations

New north pole:
- Present day location: South-Africa
- Lat/long: (-14. 31)
- Below the equator

New south pole:
- Present day location: Pacific Ocean
- Lat/long: (14, -149)
- Above the equator

## TODO

Investigate potential "nuclear winter" during S2, caused by changes in the core-mantle and dust from volcanoes.

Create a map of the world after S2, showing the new position and orientation of all continents.
