# S2 Coastline Changes

The goal of this folder is to determine what the new coastlines might be during S2.

`FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/equatorial-bulge` contains analysis which is relevant here.

## Data Points

- Khafre Pyramid: 175m
- East China: ~65m (`ADHOC-EVIDENCE/asia/china`)

## Khafre Pyramid Inundation

The Khafre Pyramid inundation of 175m for an extended period during S2 is not explained by simple oceanic displacement. The Mediterranean is not a perfect basin; it's connected to the Atlantic by the Strait of Gibraltar. Oceanic displacement alone could only explain a temporary inundation of the Khafre Pyramid. It's unlikely that the entire world experiences a sea-level rise of 175m during S2.

Rather, the Khafre Pyramid inundation is better explained by the way Earth's equatorial bulge interacts with the ECDO.

See `FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/equatorial-bulge` for an in-depth analysis.
