# Oceanic Displacement

This document is for predicting the height and extent of temporary oceanic displacement during the rotation - not the new coastlines. These factors will be key for evaluating safe locations.

In short, it is like a very complex fluid dynamics problem.

## Factors to consider in inundation height analysis

- Surrounding topography
- Total amount and speed of water being displaced

Evidences of past inundation will be helpful in fine-tuning the analysis. Every location will be unique and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## Visualizing the water flow

The water will tend to flow *around* when it can, and only travel *over* when it has nowhere else to go.

Still, have you ever stood in the tides of the ocean as they flow out to sea? The water, even if it moves around, will first react to obstacles in an upward fashion, with strength proportional to the speed of the water, without exception.

## Location Analysis Examples

`LOCATION-MAPPING` is where all the location-specific flood analysis will go. Some good examples are:
- Turkey (Urgup Cones), 1025m above sea level

I'll add to this list promptly.

## Factors that are difficult to predict

The exact amount of time it takes for the S1 -> S2 rotation will affect the ocean displacement. The shorter it takes, the faster water will rush onto the land, and the higher the obstacles it could go over.

## Basic analogy for water flow

If you have a bowl of water, and push it to the side, the water will first slosh one way, but then it'll immediately slosh back the other way. This is because the body of water is small, so the momentum travels very quickly from one end of the water to the next.

Oceans are different. Oceans are massive - extremely deep, and extremely wide. When one end of the ocean starts getting pushed, the other end of the ocean is not going to react until a long time later.

There is going to be huge amounts of water. And the water is going to meet a continent rushing at it at speeds of potentially hundreds or thousands of kilometers an hour (See `FULL-THESIS-BREAKDOWN/s1-to-s2/rotation-path-speed`).

The water will have to go somewhere, in that very moment. Just try running your hand through the surface of a pool very fast. If the land really does move at hundreds or thousands of kilometers an hour, water is inevitably going to overflow onto the land. The next question then is, how much? That is where you have to start analyzing locations case-by-case.
