# Tectonic Plates

This speculative analysis was inspired by this comment from Ethical Skeptic (`LITERATURE-MEDIA/ethical-skeptic`): *"It is possible that some or even most of our continental drift occurs quickly as a facet of ECDO events. The gradualism approach is the result of a flawed assumption now taken as proven, when it is not."*

The tectonic plates of the Earth's crust fit together like puzzle pieces, running into each other in different ways (subduction, orogeny). [2] What if, as the mantle and inner layers of the Earth expand (and shrink) in response to the new equatorial bulge, we see significant tectonic plate movement in the crust, which lies directly on top of these layers?

## Crust creation

Crust creation primarly happens at divergent boundaries, [3] but can also happen due to volcanic activity.

This visual shows some areas which could potentially see new crust creation during the ECDO rotation:

The crust created at these boundaries could then cause movement of plates in other areas, pushing plates into, across, or beneath each other.

## Misc Knowledge

### Reading tectonic plate maps

For convergent plate boundaries, the triangles point away from the plate that is being subducted (pushed underneath the other).

### Types of faults

Transform faults are where plates slide past each other horizontally.

Continental rift is when the plate is undergoing stretching and thinning, leading to the formation of a rift valley. When this progresses, it can become an oceanic spreading ridge, which is a divergent boundary.

A convergent boundary typically results in subduction or orogeny.

### Telluric Currents and Earthquake Lights

Video: Sendai, Fukushima (2022)
"Different theories have been proposed to explain the electrification of the Earth’s surface by earthquakes, but the actual process in the crust of the Earth remained unknown until Akihiro Takeuchi, at an underground mine in Japan, observed electrification on the floor of a gallery at the arrival of seismic waves. He discovered, that the arrival of S waves is synchronized with an electric pulse, that flows across the internal resistance of a voltmeter.

The electromagnetic emission in the atmosphere is produced if at any point of the Earth’s surface a limit of the electrical potential is reached at which a sudden electrical discharge through the atmosphere occurs."

## Piozeelectric Effect

The piezoelectric effect is a source of significant electric current generation in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rock masses during earthquakes. The current flows generated by granite monoliths such as found in the Rocky Mountains could easily run into billions of amps during major seismic activity. These current flows are a fitting explanation for "earthquake lights", and possibly other geological phenomena, such as Richat (which has a gabbro interior): "How much current can be delivered per unit rock volume? In the case of gabbro .. the steady-state outflow currents were found to increase to 50,000 A/km^3, plus an initial spike that can rise to 100,000 A/km^3."

Particularly interesting tectonic spot to look at: eastern pivot, Indonesia

Another one: Himalayas
