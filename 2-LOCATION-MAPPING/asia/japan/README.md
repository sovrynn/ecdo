# Japan

An island nation in East Asia lying on the Pacific Plate boundary.

## Basic geographical characteristics

Japan is the easternmost chunk of land in East Asia, which rotates clockwise, so at least in S1 -> S2, it would likely bear the full brunt of Pacific ocean displacement.

Japan also has many volcanoes, [5] and is situated right on the Pacific Plate boundary. It is known to experience many earthquakes even in normal times.

It seems likely that Japan may experience instability during S1 -> S2.

## Oldest history

The oldest written reference to Japan traces back to the Chinese Book of Han, around the first century AD. [1]

The oldest remains of human inhabitants have been traced back to at least 10,000 BC. [2] For example, human remains in the Kamikuroiwaiwakage Cave have been dated to around 14,500 years ago. [3]

It seems likely that humans did indeed inhabit Japan in periods long ago.

## Flood Myths

Japan has no major flood myths. [4] When considering such a major event as an ECDO, one may wonder why there is no major flood myth, if there were survivors to such an event, as tales would have been told about it for generations to come, and it would have significantly restructured society on the island.

## Safe Locations

Despite all this, Japan has many tall mountains. [6] It's still likely that some locations may be safe during S1 -> S2.
