If you look at the topography, and the locations of the salt pans, it looks like ocean water makes it way up via SA west coast / Namibia and then settles in the localized low areas.

The location of Etosha is quite interesting. Looks like only one way in is via the east.

Yeah, as I said in the OP, looks like a lot of water moves on the west coast. Etosha is right there.

It might slosh over to Etosha, or it goes via Makgadikgadi, implying quite a lot of volume makes it way up there.

I’m guessing it’s largely part of the return flow displacing to lower ground after the S2>S1. Was etosha I saw dating on.

Makes sense for it to be flooded less frequently, given the surrounding mountains and relatively high altitude.

I reckon the flow going from S2 - S1 is diverted by the formation on the southern tip of Namibia and then makes it way up to the basin in Botswana and only a small portion makes it as far as Etosha. Even then, possibly not every time.

The flow is probably much less severe than in other parts of the globe due to the bow effect you describe.
