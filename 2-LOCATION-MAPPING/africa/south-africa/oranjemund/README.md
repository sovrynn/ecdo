This is the diamond coast, from Oranjemund northwards. See the flow indications running north from the coast here. It comes at least 50km inland (probably more). I haven´t looked closely here yet, but I´d say that everything to the west of the red line (the ECDO moment) would be at risk returning from S2 to S1.

Red arrow marks pretty much the only point near to 5,000 ft in the region to the East of Oranjemund.
