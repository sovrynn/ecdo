# Socotra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra

Whenever I see strange places now, I always assume it's ECDO-related in some way.

Socotra, I now assume, is not inundated, which is why it has such diverse and unique species, majority of which are not found anywhere else.

"Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago's flora and fauna. They counted nearly 700 endemic species, found nowhere else on earth; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Gal√°pagos Islands have more impressive numbers."
