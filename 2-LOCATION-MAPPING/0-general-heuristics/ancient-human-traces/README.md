# Ancient Human Traces

Here I'm thinking along lines such as:
- Indonesia cave
- Archaelogic excavation sites

For example, it's hard to imagine that a theoretical archaelogical site where tools and intact structures were found could have been flooded by a huge wall of water without getting destroyed or at least scattered somehow.
