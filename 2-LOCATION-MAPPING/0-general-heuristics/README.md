# General Heuristics for Evaluating Locations

This folder is dedicated for general heuristics applicable for any location in evaluating its safety.

## Contents

- `land-elevation`: Land elevation.
- `flood-height`: Predicting how high the ocean displacement will flood.
- `ancient-human-traces`: Ancient traces of humans which potentially denote safe locations.

## TODO Additional potential useful heuristics

Additional potential heuristics:
- biodiversity hotspots
- oldest cities
- minimum distance from pivots
- protection from wind
- temperature
- proximity to fault lines
- Longest continuous inhabitation
- Longest standing tall structures
- every ethnically unique human tribe must have survived an ECDO event, because otherwise they would have had to develop their racial uniqueness within single ECDO epochs. Maybe you could model a "minimum degrees of separation", based on how much time it would take to create genetic uniqueness, to figure out the minimum genetic distance at which you could say that two different gene pools must have survived ECDO events separately
