# Investigating Safe Locations for the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

The folder is for mapping out all locations over the world, and evaluating them in context of the ECDO, telling us which locations might be safe, which might be dangerous, and gathering evidence for the ECDO in the process.

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

Analysis of certain physical landmarks or structures that could be evidence for past ECDO events should go in `ADHOC-EVIDENCE`, and then be backlinked here.

Analysis should be data-driven and thoughtful, incorporating knowledge of the ECDO thesis when relevant.

It is recommended that each location analysis begins with a map that shows the location's position relative to its surrounding landmass to help readers. This is particularly helpful for more obscure, small locations. See [Oranjemund](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/tree/master/4-LOCATION-MAPPING/africa/south-africa/oranjemund) and [Svalbard](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/tree/master/4-LOCATION-MAPPING/arctic/svalbard) as examples.
