# Investigating Safe Locations for the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

The folder is for mapping out all locations over the world, and evaluating them in context of the ECDO, telling us which locations might be safe, which might be dangerous, and gathering evidence for the ECDO in the process.

See [here](https://github.com/sovrynn/ecdo/tree/master/6-LITERATURE-MEDIA/nobulart/ecdo-visualizations) for a global visualization of S1 -> S2.

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

Analysis of certain physical landmarks or structures that could be evidence for past ECDO events should go in `ADHOC-EVIDENCE`, and then be backlinked here.

Analysis should be data-driven and thoughtful, incorporating knowledge of the ECDO thesis when relevant.

It is recommended that each location analysis begins with a map that shows the location's position relative to its surrounding landmass to help readers. This is particularly helpful for more obscure, small locations. See Oranjemund (`LOCATION-MAPPING/africa/south-africa/oranjemund`) and Svalbard (`LOCATION-MAPPING/arctic/svalbard`) as examples.

## TODO places to map out

North america:
- Look into the Appalachian mountains.
- Needles (Black Hills, USA)
- Colorado
- Slot canyons
- Arches National Park
- Spanish Peaks
- Missoula flood, lake missoula
- Burke's Garden

Europe:
- Slovenia, known for its karst landforms.
- Switzerland, with its extensive amount of bunkers and mountain landscape.
- Serpents Lair of Inis Mór, located in the Ireland, UK

Interesting cliff formations:
- China

Locations with karst landscapes:
- North Vietnam
- Borneo
- Slovenia
- South China

## TODO Nobulart quote

Nevada and Utah are classic examples of huge flood morphology. We found current ripples in Somalia which gave a calculated water depth of 1.2km, probably the Mediterranean. Observed water levels in many places appear to be in agreement with theorized movement of water. The ripples I’ve seen in France, USA, South America and Australia suggest water MUCH deeper than Somalia. Definitely 3-4km and more in places.

## TODO heuristics for evaluating locations

Additional potential heuristics:
- land elevation, flood height
- oldest cities, longest inhabitation
- protection from wind
- temperature
- proximity to fault lines
- Longest standing tall structures, old relics/remains
	- For example, it's hard to imagine that a theoretical archaelogical site where tools and intact structures were found could have been flooded by a huge wall of water without getting destroyed or at least scattered somehow.
- every sufficiently ethnically unique human tribe must have survived an ECDO event, because otherwise they would have had to develop their racial uniqueness within single ECDO epochs. Maybe you could model a "minimum degrees of separation", based on how much time it would take to create genetic uniqueness, to figure out the minimum genetic distance at which you could say that two different gene pools must have survived ECDO events separately
