# Investigating Safe Locations for the ECDO Deluge/Flooding

The folder is for mapping out all locations over the world, and evaluating them in context of the ECDO, telling us which locations might be safe, which might be dangerous, and gathering evidence for the ECDO in the process.

## Basic Contribution Guidelines

Analysis of certain physical landmarks or structures that could be evidence for past ECDO events should go in `ADHOC-EVIDENCE`, and then be backlinked here.

Analysis should be data-driven and thoughtful, incorporating knowledge of the ECDO thesis when relevant.

It is recommended that each location analysis begins with a map that shows the location's position relative to its surrounding landmass to help readers. This is particularly helpful for more obscure, small locations. See Oranjemund (`LOCATION-MAPPING/africa/south-africa/oranjemund`) and Svalbard (`LOCATION-MAPPING/arctic/svalbard`) as examples.

## TODO heuristics for evaluating locations

Additional potential heuristics:
- land elevation, flood height
- biodiversity hotspots
- oldest cities
- minimum distance from pivots
- protection from wind
- temperature
- proximity to fault lines
- Longest continuous inhabitation
- Longest standing tall structures
- every ethnically unique human tribe must have survived an ECDO event, because otherwise they would have had to develop their racial uniqueness within single ECDO epochs. Maybe you could model a "minimum degrees of separation", based on how much time it would take to create genetic uniqueness, to figure out the minimum genetic distance at which you could say that two different gene pools must have survived ECDO events separately

Ancient human traces. Here I'm thinking along lines such as that Indonesian cave or archaelogic excavation sites. For example, it's hard to imagine that a theoretical archaelogical site where tools and intact structures were found could have been flooded by a huge wall of water without getting destroyed or at least scattered somehow.
