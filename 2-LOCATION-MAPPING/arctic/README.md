## Overview

Arctic Ocean ECDO displacement visualization.[1] Bedrock without ice, including the Bering Strait, Siberia, Fennoscandia, Greenland, Canada and Alaska. The polar regions experience some of the highest land/water/air shear velocities during rotation due to their being at the maximum distance from both ECDO pivots. Add a few million gigatonnes of ice, and conditions would be about right to flash-freeze mammoths as are still being found in Alaska[2] and Siberia[3]. Swedish varved clay proxies spanning the Younger Dryas provide strong evidence for a displacement event around that time.[4] The star-like formation visible around the pole is a digital stitching artifact which arises from the projection of the map onto a sphere.

## Severny Island

### Analysis

Severny Island. Red lines are the ECDO moment of inertia. Extensive evidence of highly uniform directional scouring, as is characteristic of high velocity water flows.
