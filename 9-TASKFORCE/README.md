# ECDO Taskforce

This is for actual things to do - for a real group of people working on the ECDO.

## Key Initiatives

- Establishment of an organized ECDO taskforce body, with a digital meeting place
- Creation of "propaganda": a compelling, one-sided, impressionable form of media with the goal of convincing even the most unthinking member of society in the impending nature of, and need to prepare for, an ECDO event. This will enlarge the number of "ECDO members" - the people with not only full conviction of the need of such an effort but also the willingness and action-drive to put their full efforts behind preparing for the ECDO
- The furtherment of ECDO research, and the location of "safe spots"
	- ECDO research backup
- The design, procurement of land for, and implementation of various "ECDO ark" bunker/ship structures designed to protect humanity from the dangers of an ECDO cataclysm
- The design and production of a persistent form of mechanical bit storage that will store humanity's knowledge and last forever when properly maintained

## Initial TODOs

1. The informational selection, design, and production of "ECDO propaganda".
2. Continued ECDO research in locating "safe spots".
3. ECDO bunker design
4. Mechanical durable bit storage computing paradigm design
